Early life and family background
James Hinks was born in about 1816 in Atherstone, Warwickshire, the son of Jonathan Hinks, a wool comber. He was the younger brother of John Hinks, a well-known and successful steel pen manufacturer.

Career
James left home when he was 16 and tried his hand at a range of occupations, including wood turning and japanning, pub landlord, brush making, die sinking, medal making and cotton reel manufacture before turning his mind to perfecting the design of oil lamps. By 1858, in partnership with James Syson Nibbs, he was manufacturing an improved oil lamp from the Crystal Lamp Works on the corner of Great Hampton Street and Hockley Street, Birmingham. The partnership with Nibbs was dissolved in July 1858, although the lamps appear to have continued to be marketed by James under the Nibbs and Hinks name until December 1858.

James' son, Joseph, worked for his father from about the time he was 17 and by 1861 he was recorded as a manufacturer in the same terms as his father. By 1862 the business was called James Hinks and Son. A patent was granted to James Hinks in 1863 for ""improvements in lamps"", and there were subsequent design improvements. The Patent Duplex Lamp, marketed from about 1864, used two wicks instead of the usual one, and gave out twice the light. The great selling point of Hinks lamps was that they did not need frequent trimming or give off nasty smoke or smells.

The company was first incorporated in 1873 (and re-incorporated in 1896). Newspaper reports suggest that James retired as Managing Director and became Chairman in about 1897–98, when Joseph took over. The firm had bases in London and Birmingham. Important customers included railway companies, which used oil lamps to light stations, trains and signals. With an eye to the domestic market, Hinks' lamps were also decorative and borrowing from the designs of beautiful European china and porcelain table decorations their lamps were also a byword for domestic beauty, so much so that there is still a flourishing market for antique Hinks' lamps. They also developed specialist lamps and hurricane lanterns for India which was one of their most lucrative markets. Hinks' lamps were state-of-the-art until the early 20th century when electric lighting became the norm.

Other interests
James had interests outside of business. For a time he was president of Aston Villa Football Club and he regularly attended matches at the Wellington Road ground at Perry Barr. He was a well known ""courser"" (someone who races greyhounds); some of his dogs were very well known in their time.

Personal life
James married Elizabeth Benton (1816–1896) in Birmingham in 1839. They had six children, but three died in infancy; two daughters and a son, Joseph, survived. James retired in 1898 at the age of 83 and handed over the reins to Joseph.

Death
James died in Edgbaston, aged 90, on 21 December 1905 and was buried in Key Hill Cemetery, Birmingham. When he died his estate was valued at over £80,000 [about £8m in today's money] and his will made generous bequests to local hospitals, charities and his servants (as well as his family).

Under the command of Kapitänleutnant August Maus, she had some success against Allied aircraft in World War II.

Laid down on 1 July 1941 by DeSchiMAG AG Weser of Bremen as yard number 1025, she was launched on 2 March 1942 and commissioned on 13 June. She suffered no casualties until her sinking by US carrier-borne aircraft on 24 August 1943 at . Twenty-nine of the crew were lost, as well as fourteen survivors from  who were on board.

Design
German Type IXC/40 submarines were slightly larger than the original Type IXCs. U-185 had a displacement of  when at the surface and  while submerged. The U-boat had a total length of , a pressure hull length of , a beam of , a height of , and a draught of . The submarine was powered by two MAN M 9 V 40/46 supercharged four-stroke, nine-cylinder diesel engines producing a total of  for use while surfaced, two Siemens-Schuckert 2 GU 345/34 double-acting electric motors producing a total of  for use while submerged. She had two shafts and two  propellers. The boat was capable of operating at depths of up to .

The submarine had a maximum surface speed of  and a maximum submerged speed of . When submerged, the boat could operate for  at ; when surfaced, she could travel  at . U-185 was fitted with six  torpedo tubes (four fitted at the bow and two at the stern), 22 torpedoes, one  SK C/32 naval gun, 180 rounds, and a  SK C/30 as well as a  C/30 anti-aircraft gun. The boat had a complement of forty-eight.

Service history

First patrol
U-185 sailed from Kiel on 27 October 1942. On 7 December she sank the unescorted 5,476 GRT British cargo ship Peter Mærsk west of the Azores. She docked at Lorient in France on 1 January 1943 after 67 days at sea.

Second patrol
U-185 sailed from Lorient on 8 February 1943. On 10 March she attacked Convoy KG 123 in the Windward Passage (between Cuba and Hispaniola), sinking the 6,151 GRT American tanker Virginia Sinclair and the 7,177 GRT liberty ship James Sprunt. On 6 April U-185 attacked the four-ship convoy GTMO-83, and sank the 7,176 GRT liberty ship John Sevier. She then sailed to Bordeaux on 3 May after 85 days at sea.

Third patrol
On 14 June she was attacked in the Bay of Biscay by a British Whitley bomber of 10 OTU (Operational Training Unit) based at RAF St Eval in Cornwall.  was sunk, but U-185s flak defenses damaged the aircraft, forcing it to ditch.

On 7 July U-185, off Cape San Roque, Brazil, attacked the convoy BT-18, sinking the liberty ships James Robertson and Thomas Sinnickson, the 7,061 GRT tanker William Boyce Thompson also went to the bottom. She then badly damaged the 6,840 GRT tanker S.B. Hunt. On 12 July, around 90 miles off Recife, Brazil, the U-boat was attacked by a B-24 Liberator bomber of US Navy Squadron VB-107, but sustained only minor damage.

The boat sank the 8,235 GRT Brazilian cargo ship Bagé, a straggler from convoy TJ-2, off the Rio Real, Brazil, on 1 August and on the sixth, she torpedoed and then sank with gunfire the unescorted 7,133 GRT British cargo ship Fort Halkett about  southeast of Natal, Brazil. On 3 August  U-185 was attacked by a Ventura bomber of Squadron VB-107 with depth charges, wounding one man.

Sinking
On the morning of 11 August 1943 U-185 rendezvoused with the stricken , which had been badly damaged after two attacks by US aircraft and the destroyer , but which began to transfer provisions, fuel oil and spare parts to U-185.  arrived later to assist, but the concentration of U-boats was detected by HF/DF; as a result, the surfaced boats were attacked by a United States Navy PBY-4 Liberator, of Squadron VB-107. U-172 escaped, the crew of U-185 opened fire with AA guns, shooting down the aircraft, killing the crew of three.

After U-604 was scuttled, U-185 headed for home, with 100 men crammed aboard a U-boat designed for 54. On 16 August she transferred 23 men to U-172. Short of fuel, U-185 was heading for a rendezvous with  south-west of the Azores on the morning of 24 August. The U-boat was spotted by a Grumman TBF-1 Avenger and Grumman F4F Wildcat attack team of Squadron VC-13, flying from the escort carrier . The aircraft attacked with machine guns and depth charges, killing the U-boat's lookouts and AA crew and rupturing the pressure hull, allowing seawater to reach the battery cells and produce toxic chlorine gas. One diesel engine caught fire, producing more fumes, and all electrical systems were knocked out, plunging the vessel into darkness.

Realizing that the situation was hopeless, Maus ordered all hands to abandon ship. More than 40 men managed to reach the deck and jump into the sea as U-185 sank. Only 36 men were later rescued by the destroyer , the rest succumbing to wounds or chlorine poisoning. The 25 men from U-185 and the nine survivors from U-604 spent the following three years as POWs before returning to Germany.

On 21 September 1943 Kapitänleutnant August Maus was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross.

Wolfpacks
U-185 took part in one wolfpack, namely:
 Westwall (8 November - 16 December 1942)

It contains only the type species Scapanops neglecta, which was named by Rainer R. Schoch and Hans-Dieter Sues in 2013. Scapanops differs from other dissorophids in having a very small skull table, which means that its eye sockets are unusually close to the back of the skull. The eye sockets are also very large and spaced far apart. Scapanops was probably small-bodied (around  long) with a proportionally large head and short trunk and tail. Like other dissorophids, it probably spent most of its life on land.

Description
The only known skull of Scapanops is  long. Scapanops is distinguished from other dissorophids by five unique features or autapomorphies: a large spacing between the orbits or eye sockets, giving the skull an oval-shaped outline; a very small skull table behind the orbits; a long snout twice as long as the skull table and proportionally longer than that of any other dissorophid; a jaw joint (the quadrate condyle) positioned farther forward on the skull than it is in other dissorophids; and a skull roof that is covered in small ridges, but not pits as in most other dissorophids. It shares several features (synapomorphies) with the dissorophids Conjunctio and Cacops, including and bony plates called osteoderms that are fused to the vertebrae. The osteoderms form a single row along the back. Scapanops and Conjunctio both have numerous small teeth lining their jaws, suggesting that they ate small prey. Other closely related dissorophids have fewer and larger teeth, meaning that they probably ate larger prey.

Discovery
Scapanops is known from a single holotype specimen from the Nocona Formation, which is part of the Early Permian red beds of Texas. It includes most of the skull as well as the humerus, radius, and clavicle bones, which are preserved underneath the skull. Several vertebrae, ribs, and osteoderms are also known. The fossil, now housed in the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard University, was discovered by American paleontologist Alfred Romer on April 15, 1950 and was first mentioned in the scientific literature by paleontologist Robert L. Carroll in 1964. During this time it was thought to belong to the species Conjunctio multidens. In 2013 the specimen was recognized to belong to a separate genus, which was named Scapanops after the spade-like shape of its skull (from the Greek skapane). The suffix -ops is meant to associate it with the genus Cacops, a closely related dissorophid. The specific name neglecta references the neglected status of the holotype specimen after its initial description in 1964.

Relationships
A phylogenetic analysis of dissorophids published in 2013 found Scapanops to be one of the most basal members of a clade called Eucacopinae. Eucacopines are characterized by their lightly built skeletons and knobby skulls. The most basal eucacopine was found to be Conjunctio while Scapanops was positioned close to a derived clade of eucacopines that includes the genus Cacops (which is also from the Early Permian of the southwestern United States) and the Russian genera Zygosaurus and Kamacops. While members of the derived eucacopine clade have two rows of osteoderms down their backs, Scapanops and Conjunctio have only a single row of osteoderms down their backs. A single row of osteoderms is thought to be the ancestral condition for the dissorophid clade including Eucacopinae and its sister taxon Dissorophinae. Like the derived eucacopines, dissorophines also have two rows of osteoderms, meaning that the feature evolved independently in both groups and that Scapanops represents the point in eucacopine evolution before the two rows of osteoderms appeared. Below is a cladogram from the 2013 analysis:

He is a member of the Democratic Party. He served in the United States Marine Corps during the Vietnam War at the rank of corporal.

Early life, education and career
Vic Snyder was born in Medford, Oregon. He is a graduate of Medford High School (1965) and attended college at Willamette University in Salem, Oregon, where he was a member of Kappa Sigma. In 1967, after two years of college, Snyder volunteered for the United States Marine Corps. He served in South Vietnam with Headquarters Company of the US 1st Marine Division during the Vietnam War. He served for two years and attained the rank of corporal. Snyder earned a degree in Chemistry in 1975 from Willamette and earned his M.D. degree from the University of Oregon Health Sciences Center (now Oregon Health & Science University) in Portland, Oregon in 1979.

Snyder moved to Little Rock, Arkansas and served his residency at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences. In 1982 after completing his residency he worked as a family practice physician for 15 years. During this time he travelled overseas to volunteer his medical services at Cambodian refugee camps in Thailand, Salvadoran refugee camps in Honduras, and Ethiopian refugee camps in Sudan. From 1985 to 1988 Snyder attended the University of Arkansas at Little Rock School of Law to obtain his J.D. degree while still maintaining his medical practice.

Arkansas Legislature
In 1990, Snyder successfully ran for a seat in the Arkansas legislature and served in that body until 1996. In the Arkansas legislature, Snyder stepped into one of his earliest legislative controversies when he attempted to repeal the state's aged ""Sodomy Laws"". Ultimately, however, his efforts failed, and the sodomy laws stayed in effect until the state Supreme Court struck it down in Jegley v. Picado in March 2001.

U.S. House of Representatives

Committee assignments
Committee on Armed Services
Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations (Chairman)
Subcommittee on Military Personnel
Committee on Veterans' Affairs
Subcommittee on Health
Joint Economic Committee

Snyder focuses on many traditionally liberal issues, including a particular interest in support for veteran's and military families. He has a fairly liberal voting record for being an elected politician from the South and otherwise conservative-leaning Arkansas. Snyder voted against the Federal Marriage Amendment, the ban on partial-birth abortions, banning lawsuits against gun manufacturers and distributors, bankruptcy reform, drilling in ANWR, and on October 10, 2002, he was among the 133 members of the House who voted against authorizing the invasion of Iraq. In addition, Snyder was one of only two Congressmen to vote against prosecuting Saddam Hussein.

On issues of free and expanded trade, Snyder differs with his party, especially his Southern populist colleagues. He has also opposed legislation cracking down on Wal-Mart, which is headquartered in Bentonville, Arkansas.

Political campaigns

Snyder was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1996 and was reelected in 1998, 2000, 2002, 2004, 2006 and 2008.

Snyder announced on January 15, 2010 that he would retire at the conclusion of his term which ends in 2010. A SurveyUSA poll released January 15, 2010 showed him trailing his Republican challenger, Tim Griffin, by 17 points.

The game was released in January 2012 for Microsoft Windows via Steam, and Mac OS X through Steam in May 2012. A Linux port was released as part of the Humble Indie Bundle 6. Capcom published the game for the PlayStation 3, PlayStation Vita, and Xbox 360.

Within the game, the player controls one of four janitors who are attempting to sweep away a world corrupted with dust and filth. The player uses a number of acrobatic skills, such as double jumping and wall jumping to progress through the game's fifty-some levels, cleaning sections covered by leaves and attacking filth-covered creatures to score and progress through the level.  The player's performance is ranked based on time and completion, and access to certain levels requires near-perfect runs of earlier levels.

Gameplay
Dustforce is a platform game that has been compared to games such as Super Meat Boy and N+, where fast-response timed actions are considered necessary to complete the game. It is set in a world where filth has corrupted the creatures that live in the area; the four-member Dustforce team of janitors aims to clean up the mess and restore the world. An overworld provides access to more than fifty levels, though about half are initially locked to the player.

After the player selects a level, they pick one of the four Dustforce members, who all share the same moves but have slightly different statistics, such as jumping height. Within the level, the player must maneuver their character to the end goal using acrobatic tricks such as double jumps, wall jumps, mid-air dashes, and clinging to the ceiling. Along the way, the character will automatically sweep up any debris on the walls or floors. The player can also initiate regular and super-attacks against filth-covered creatures to restore them to normal. The end goal of a level typically requires reaching a final area and defeating foes waiting there. Should the character run into any hazards such as pits or spikes on the level, the player will have to resume the run from a previous checkpoint.

Upon completing a level, the player is ranked based on ""finesse"" and completion. Finesse is determined by the combo meter, which is reset if the player takes a hit or proceeds too slowly, and completion is determined by the amount of debris and enemies cleaned. The ratings, evaluated separately, are based on a letter-grade scale, with ""D"" through ""A"" reflecting increasingly better performances, and an ""S"" grade, representing a perfect combo, or full completion. Completing a level with an ""S"" grade in both finesse and completion provides the player with one of three colored keys to unlock certain levels in the overworld.

The player is also rated on a scoring system and ranked on a global leaderboard.  The player scores a fixed number of points for every patch of filth that is cleaned up multiplied by their current combo meter, and increases their current combo meter by 1.  The combo meter only stays active for a short period of time, but resets for each patch cleaned up; thus by hitting many patches in a row quickly, the player can build up the combo multiplier and drastically increase their score. Player replays are stored online with the leaderboards, allowing other players to review how top scorers were able to complete various levels. The PlayStation 3 version will include the ability to save and share level replays to YouTube, while this, the Vita, and Xbox 360 version will include the ability to save replays locally.

Dustforce includes a four-player local multiplayer mode including variants such as Survival and King of the Hill modes, where players scale the level and fight against other players towards victory. Players can act as the janitors, cleaning up filth, while the other players lay down filth on clean patches of the level.

A level editor for both single player and multiplayer maps was released as part of a patch for the Windows version of the game and the debut of the Mac OS X version. Levels are shared through a website created by Hitbox Team. The PlayStation and Xbox versions includes 150 user-generated level as voted on by players.

Development

Designer Woodley Nye came up with the idea one day while sweeping a pile of leaves. The team was working on another game at the time but switched to Dustforce when they heard about the Indiepub contest. In designing the game Nye wanted to create an acrobatic 2D platformer. He credits the games N and Nikujin as inspirations for the project. Hitbox has also stated that the game Super Smash Bros. Melee was an influence to the team citing its easy pick up and play approach while still maintaining a level of depth for experienced players. In selecting the art style Nye opted for a simplistic style that would showcase the various frames of animation. He has cited Dragon Ball Z as an influence in terms of design aesthetic stating that ""they have great poses and also good shapes"".

Dustforce won the $100,000 Grand Prize at indiePub Games' Third Independent Game Developers Competition at the 2010 Game Developers Conference Online. The money was used by the four-person Hitbox team to develop the game over about one and a half years.

After about a year of its successful release on Microsoft Windows, Capcom talked to Hitbox about porting the title to consoles. Capcom used their localization team, QLoc, to support the transition to console and managing features like leaderboards and replay saving. The console version will include 150 user-created levels from the Windows version as voted on by players.

On 10 January 2012, the developers announced in a blog post that the game would be released in a week's time, on 17 January 2012. The blog post, which also contained a gameplay trailer (right), surprised the gaming media.

DX Update 

On October 23, 2014, Hitbox announced on their website that a free update to Dustforce, Dustforce DX, was available to all owners of the base game. The DX update added 109 community maps accessible through an in-game console, a new music track by Lifeformed, and support for Steam trading cards. The update also included changes designed to make the game friendlier to newer players. The single tutorial was broken into 3 separate maps, 16 easier levels were added, and the 4 world hubs were consolidated into a single area. The overworld redesign makes it more difficult to reach the harder levels. According to Hitbox developer Woodley Nye, the redesign “helps in two ways: it keeps new players away from levels they aren't ready for yet, and it serves as a teaching tool for more advanced techniques that are required in the tougher levels.”

Reception

Dustforce was generally well received by critics, praised for its demanding gameplay, online leaderboard features, graphics, and soundtrack.  Kyle Orland of Ars Technica, was pleased with the difficulty of the game even after facing levels he could not complete, and considered Dustforce as ""a game that's not content to let you be content with yourself, and for that it's definitely worth playing"". Marsh Davies of Eurogamer considered that once a player can work their way through a level with perfect completion, ""it's hard not to admire the pat precision of the controls or deny the transcendent joy of a high-ranking run"". The use of reviewing online replays was highly praised to help players that were stumbling with the game. IGN's Anthony Gallegos considered the replays to be not only ""awesome and humbling"" to review, but also aiding in teaching the player of new techniques. Several noted that Dustforce is the type of game that a player may get frustrated with quickly after replaying levels over and over to get the ""S"" grades, but this emotion is calmed by the game's graphics and music. PC Gamers Lucas Sullivan considered that the combination of the ""soothing, ethereal background music"" and ""fluid animations and beautifully stylized character designs"" provided a zen-like meditative setting for the player to practice within. Nathan Grayson of GameSpy considered that ""the whole audio-visual package colludes to create a strikingly powerful soothing effect"" that contrasts the tight demands of the gameplay.

Some reviewers noted that the game fails to fully explain some of its features through the simplistic menus.  There is no immediate information about the differences between the characters when selecting one prior to a level, and the multiplayer mode is not well explained. Others noted that the multiplayer mode felt like an add-on, and without online connectivity, would likely not be a feature many gamers would play. Although the game defaults to the use of keyboard controls, several found these to be a hindrance and switched to a gamepad, which had to be configured manually. Some reviewers also noted that the game has some performance issues based on its initial release.

Sales of the game were boosted by both being featured in a mid-week Steam promotion in May 2012, its inclusion in the Humble Bundle, and further discounts during 2012 holiday season sales. Hitbox states that the team directly earned US$ 489,000 after one year of sales, which will be used to fund development of their next game, Spire.

Swimming for the Olympic Nice Natation club, she specialised in the individual medley and the free style events. Her career ran from 2005 to 2014.

At the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, she won gold in the 400-metre freestyle, silver in the 200-metre freestyle and bronze in the 4×200-metre freestyle relay, becoming the fourth French swimmer to win an individual Olympic gold medal. She was also the third French athlete overall to win three Olympic medals at a single edition of the Olympic Games.

She died in the Villa Castelli helicopter collision, at age 25, during the filming of French TV reality show Dropped for the TF1 network.

Early life
Born on 28 October 1989 in Nice, Camille Marie Manuella Muffat was the middle child in the family, having an older sister, Chloé, and a younger brother, Quentin. Her father, Guy Muffat was a physical therapist and her mother, Laurence, was a nurse.

Upon finishing high school, she pursued a degree in economics, during which time she swam under a high-performance athlete studying system. She eventually dropped out of school in order to pursue her swimming career.

Career
Muffat was trained as a medley swimmer who was particularly gifted in the breaststroke and crawl styles, which are the closing disciplines in the medley.

However, after a strong start to her career, her results in the medley events started to fade, and Muffat felt like she could not sustain her pace well enough to achieve her goals by swimming the medley. As a result, she changed her swimming profile, switching to the freestyle events, at the suggestion of her coach Fabrice Pellerin.

Under Pellerin's guidance, Muffat dedicated herself to an extensive training programme, which included training on Sundays for a year before the 2012 Olympic Games.

2005–2007
Muffat first came into the spotlight in 2005, upon beating fellow Frenchwoman Laure Manaudou in the 200-metre individual medley event at the French National Championship, in Nancy, also breaking the French national record, which Manaudou also held.

Only months later, she would again win the 200-metre individual medley event at the European Junior Championships, held in Budapest, Hungary. At the European Juniors, she would also take silver in the 100-metre freestyle.

In 2006, she debuted in the senior European Championships by swimming a leg of the 4 × 100 metres freestyle relay for France. A month later, she won four medals, including one gold, at that year's World Junior Championships, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. In December 2006, she attained her first international podium, at the European Short Course Championships in Helsinki, Finland.

In 2007, for the first time Muffat took part in a World Championship, held in Melbourne, Australia, reaching semifinals in the 400 m medley. At the end of the year, she had her first victory in senior competitions, by winning the 200-metre individual medley and taking bronze in the 400-metre individual medley event at the 2007 European Short Course Swimming Championships in Debrecen, Hungary.

2008–2011
In March 2008, Muffat won her first medal as a senior, long-course international event, by taking bronze at the 200-metre individual medley at the European Championships in Eindhoven, Netherlands.

On the first day of the 2008 French national championships, a qualifying event for that year's Olympic Games, Muffat and Joanne Andraca tied in the 400 m individual medley (IM) in a new French record of 4:38.23. Two days later, she won gold at the 200-metre individual medley by breaking Laure Manaudou's French record. At the end of competition, Muffat had qualified for the 200- and the 400-metre individual medley events at the Olympics, and clinched a berth in the French team for the 4 × 200 metre freestyle relay.

At the 2008 Summer Olympics, however, Muffat only qualified for the final of the relay, where the team finished fifth.

Later, at the 2008 European Short Course Championships, held in Rijeka, Muffat finished second in the 400-metre freestyle, bested by her countrywoman and former Olympic relay teammate, Coralie Balmy. On both the 200- and 400-metre individual medley events, she finished in fifth place.

At the 2009 French national championships, Muffat sets a new French record in the 200 m IM (2:09.34). At that year's World Championships, in Rome, she finished 7th in the 200 m individual medley final, and takes part in the French team that finishes eighth in the 4 × 200 m freestyle relay final.

At the 2010 French Championship, in Saint-Raphäel, she wins both the 200 m individual medley event and the 400 m individual medley event, finishing second to Coralie Balmy in the 200 m freestyle event. At the European Championships in Budapest, Muffat arrived as the favourite to take gold at the 200 m individual medley, declaring to the press that the gold medal is her objective in that event. However, after leading the field into the third discipline of the medley, the breaststroke, she was overtaken by Hungarian Katinka Hosszú, causing Muffat to lose momentum and finish fourth in the event. On the same day, the French 4 × 200 m freestyle relay team also finishes second in the final when Muffat, who was anchoring the French relay, got overtaken by another Hungarian swimmer, Evelyn Verrasztó. Two days later, she would also finish 4th in the 200 m freestyle event, which was won by Italian swimmer Federica Pellegrini.

Following her disappointing results, her coach, Fabrice Pellerin, urges Muffat to make a choice between the medley events and the freestyle events. Choosing the latter, Muffat improved her results in freestyle swimming, taking first place in all distances (50 m, 100 m, 200 m and 400 m) at the following French Championships, at Chartre, where she also broke the French record in the 100 m freestyle event.

A month later, at the 2010 World Short Course Championships in Dubai, Muffat would take her first world title, by winning the 200 m freestyle event, defeating Katie Hoff of the United States and Kylie Palmer of Australia. Swimming with the French 4 × 200 m freestyle relay, she also took a bronze medal from the event.

In 2011, Muffat repeated the feat of winning all four distances (100 m, 200 m, 400 m and 800 m) at the French Championships in Strasbourg, thus also qualifying in all events for that year's World Championships, in Shanghai, China. At the World Championships Muffat took two bronze medals, in the 200 m and the 400 m freestyle events.

2012–2014
In March 2012, at the French Championships in Dunkerque, Muffat won the 400 m freestyle event by breaking Laure Manaudou's French record, established in 2006. Her time of 4:01:13 was the world's fastest of the year at the time, and earned her a berth in that year's Olympic Games. Two days later, Muffat would also win the 200 m freestyle event, breaking her own French record with a time of 1:54:87, thus qualifying for that event as well at the Olympic Games in London.

Muffat qualified to enter three events at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. She won the gold medal in the 400 m freestyle with a new Olympic record, as well as the silver medal in the 200 m freestyle event. Also, her 4 × 200 m freestyle team won the bronze medal in a time of 7:47.49. [Camille Muffat (1:55.51); Charlotte Bonnet (1:57.78); Ophélie-Cyrielle Étienne (1:58.05); Coralie Balmy (1:56.15)]. She thus equalled Laure Manaudou's 2004 Olympics achievement of one gold, one silver and one bronze, and also became only the third Frenchwoman after Micheline Ostermeyer and Manaudou to win three medals in a single summer or winter Olympic Games.

In April 2013, at the French Championships in Rennes, she won the 400 m freestyle event for a third consecutive time, while also winning the 100 m and 200 m freestyle events, which qualified her for all three events at the 2013 World Championships in Barcelona, Spain.

Her performance at the 2013 World Championships, however, were below expectations, with Muffat taking home the bronze medals, in the 200 m freestyle and the 4 × 200 m freestyle relay. In her signature 400 m freestyle event, however, she finished a disappointing seventh in the final.

After the World Championships, Muffat decided to cut down on her training routine temporarily, and took a gold, a silver and a bronze at the 2013 French Short Course Championships in Dijon. At that year's European Championships, however, she failed to qualify for the 200 m freestyle final, and finished fifth in the 400 m.

At the 2014 French Championships in Chartres, a qualifying event for the 2014 European Championships, Muffat won four titles, taking gold in the 100 m, 200 m and 400 m freestyle, as well as in the 100 m butterfly. She also took silver in the 50 m freestyle.

However, on 12 July 2014, before the European Championships, she announced her retirement from competitive swimming at age 24, during an interview to the French newspaper, L'Équipe.

Death

On 9 March 2015, as a part of a group of sports stars participating in the French reality TV show Dropped, Muffat was killed along with nine other people when two helicopters collided in mid-air during filming in northwestern Argentina. Her funeral was held in a private ceremony in the Church of St. John the Baptist, in Nice, on 25 March, in a joint service with boxer Alexis Vastine, who died in the same accident.

Earnings, sponsorships and accolades
Muffat's agent, Sophie Kamoun, refused to disclose details concerning the income earned by Muffat in commercial endorsements. The French newspaper Le Figaro estimated that for the year 2013, it should be close to €500,000.

She signed a sponsorship deal with Électricité de France ahead of the 2012 Olympic Games, and the French Olympic Committee also pays money prizes for athletes earning medals at the games.

On 1 January 2013, Muffat was made a Knight (Chevalier) of the Légion d'honneur.

The film was produced by S. C. Pillai whose previous production Passenger was a critical and commercial success.

Plot
""Tune in for a change"" is the tagline attached to Radio in the credits. The storyline is about a girl Priya who comes to the city for a job as a salesgirl in a jewellery shop, with a load of debt to pay off, played by Sarayu. She is new to the ways and customs of the city life. Her co-worker, Iniya (character name Shweta), gives her accommodation, since she has no place or relative's house to stay in the city. Shweta goes out every night, where Nishan (character name Manu), comes to pick her up. The entire storyline is clear, Shweta, a five star prostitute and associate Manu as pimp, for securing her business. It is a shock to Priya when she realizes the truth about Shweta and decides to leave her friendship and apartment.

A set back comes to Priya because of her need of cash, for her mother’s operation, which Shweta supports by her extra -profession. Since Priya’s requirement is cash, she too falls for the lucrative offers, to trade her body, if she wants to, for a psychiatrist doctor to provide him company for 1 or 2 years.

Meanwhile, Shweta's family decides to go ahead with a marriage proposal for her. She tries to avoid engagement. But the bridegroom is determined to take her in, and forget her past. She agrees for marriage, and they marries. One of her clients happens to be her husband’s friend, and his visits their house, adding up slight sparks of fire.

Priya follows her pro-life with the doctor and finally ends up cheated by her family and the doctor when his wife and daughter who abandoned him, returns from States. At last Priya becomes mad.

Maniyan Pilla Raju’s character as Priya’s father and Harisree Ashokan as a broker agent are similar set of masks which they have worn before.

He was the centre of the Lyonnese côterie that elaborated the theory of spiritual love, derived partly from Plato and partly from Petrarch. This spiritual love, which animated Antoine Héroet's Parfaicte Amye (1543) as well, owed much to Marsilio Ficino, the Florentine translator and commentator of Plato's works.

Scève's chief works are Délie, objet de plus haulte vertu (1544); five anatomical blazons; the elegy Arion (1536) and the eclogue La Saulsaye (1547); and Microcosme (1562), an encyclopaedic poem beginning with the fall of man. Scève's epigrams, which have seen renewed critical interest since the late 19th century, were seen as difficult even in Scève's own day, although Scève was praised by Du Bellay, Ronsard, Pontus de Tyard and Des Autels for raising French poetry to new, higher aesthetic standards.

Scève died sometime after 1560; the exact date of his death is unknown.

Life

Scève is believed to have been born in 1501. His father was a Lyonnese lawyer and municipal officer who served as Lyon's ambassador to the court upon the accession of François I to the throne, giving the family a strong social standing in the city.

The Lyonnese school, of which Scève was the leader, included his friend Claude de Taillemont, Barthélémy Aneau, the physician Pierre Tolet and the women writers Jeanne Gaillarde—placed by Clément Marot on an equality with Christine de Pisan—Pernette du Guillet, Louise Labé, Clémence de Bourges and the poet's sisters, Claudine and Sybille Scève.

Work

Scève's first acclaim as a poet came in 1535, when he sent a pair of blasons to Marot in response to Le Blason du Beau Tétin. Le Sourcil (""The Eyebrow"") and La Larme (""The Tear"") were submitted as a part of a contest organized by Marot while in exile in Ferrara; the former was judged the winner, gaining notoriety for Scève in both France and Italy. These two poems were published along with others from the contest in 1536. Three additional Scève blasons (Le Front, La Gorge and Le Soupir) were published in the 1539 edition.

Délie, Scève's most notable work, consists of 449 dizains (10-line epigrammes) preceded by a dedicatory huitain (8-line poem) to his mistress (""A sa Délie""). The title is sometimes understood to be an anagram for l'idée (""the idea""). Délie is the first French ""canzoniere"" or poetic collection modeled after Petrarch's immensely-popular Canzoniere, a series of love poems addressed to a Lady.

Scève was also responsible for the translation of a sentimental novel, Grimalte y Gradissa by Juan de Flores, published as La Déplorable fin de Flamète in 1535, which was inspired by Giovanni Boccaccio.

Scève was a well versed musician as well as a poet; he cared very much for the musical value of the words he used, in this and in his erudition he forms a link between the school of Marot and the Pléiade.

Brunetière, ""Un Précurseur de la Pléiade, Maurice Scève,"" in his Etudes critiques, vol. vi. (1899).

More recent scholarship includes V. Saunier's two-volume Sorbonne dissertation on the poet (Paris, 1948), as well as three excellent critical editions by Eugène Parturier (Paris, 1916, reissued 2001 with an introduction and bibliography by C. Alduy), I.D McFarlane (Cambridge, 1966) and Gérard Defaux (Geneva, 2004). McFarlane's edition remains authoritative. Critical studies, with various approaches, by Dorothy Coleman, Jerry Nash, Nancy Frelick, Cynthia Skenazi, James Helgeson and Thomas Hunkeler are particularly useful; important articles on the poet have been written by François Rigolot, Enzo Giudici, Edwin Duval, Terence Cave, Gérard Defaux, and Richard Sieburth's ""Introduction"" to Emblems of Desire: Selections from the ""Délie"", a work which Sieburth translated and edited (see External links below for link to Sieburth's Introduction available on-line).

A complete annotated bibliography of all works by and on Scève since his lifetime has recently been published (Cécile Alduy, Maurice Scève, Roma: Memini, 2006, 200pp.). It contains in particular all the critical literature, past and present, on Scève and his works.

Habitat
These sea snails live on coral reefs and under rocks, from the intertidal zone to a depth of about 30 m.

Description
Shells of Mitra papalis can reach a length of about . The form of these large shells is similar to a Papal mitre (hence the common name). They are elongate to ovate, fusiform and smooth but without axial streaks on the surface. Sutural coronations are present. The aperture is moderately wide, smooth within. The shell surface is white, with small white nodules under sutures and with several rows of irregular bright red-orange or purplish blotches.

This species is quite similar to Mitra stictica, but its body form is longer, with more adpressed sutures and wider nodules.

PHOENIX is also foreseen as a fundamental component for all future ATM systems in the DFS into the 2020s and part of the DFS initiative for “ATS componentware” in the European SESAR programme.

Introduction 

Since 2001, the DFS has developed its own radar and sensor data processing system, called PHOENIX (a programmatic name instead of an acronym), which is applied in a variety of environments, for a variety of purposes, and with a variety of functional requirements. With PHOENIX the DFS aimed at the level of an advanced ATC system in terms of the previous definitions, not to ATM. To meet these challenges a series of general concepts had been developed and implemented, which are of general interest for the definition and implementation of advanced ATC and C³ systems.

The PHOENIX tracker was originally developed for the surveillance of civilian ATC traffic. It is capable to perform MSDF utilizing very different sensor types regarding accuracy, update rates, as well as their supported attributes. Due to its flexible design it is perfectly suitable for surface movement ground surveillance.

Grand context 
German air traffic of today comprises between 1,000 and 2,000 aircraft tracks at the same time in the national airspace. Besides classical ATC radars also new types of sensors or position information sources like Multilateration, ADS-B, and others are to be integrated. Per day it is required to process up to 10,000 flight plans. In the context of the discussion and development of transnational functional airspaces block like FABEC the required number of maintainable tracks will even grow beyond the 3,000, possibly more than 5,000 simultaneous tracks. An equivalent growth in needed flightplan handling capacity can be reasonably assumed. Each aircraft needs suitable Kalman filtering for tracking to cope both with steady flight and manoeuvre conditions in the different airspaces, and each IFR aircraft needs linkage processing to correlate flightplan data correctly to the track; simple code-callsign-pairing is insufficient due to multiple use of SSR codes.

At the same time the track and flightplan data have to be presented to a number of controller workstations (CWPs), ranging from 1 (low-end applications) or 5 (in towers) to 120 (in ACCs), which results in the demand of an excellent scalability for such a system. Furthermore, CWPs will create much coordination data and additional track-related information which are distributed over the LAN and eventually to external partner systems. To keep the total complex still controllable, system status monitoring and commanding facilities have to be inbuilt. Last but not least such system environments need large sets of configuration and resource data that have to be managed efficiently.

Phoenix deployment 
PHOENIX is a common R/SDPS tool in the German ATC world, used at more than 150 operational locations, scheduled for more than 700 additional locations, and used as a test, analysis, and evaluation tool in more than 200 locations. 
Today, PHOENIX is an international R/SDPS tool with system recognised internationally.

Phoenix Paradigm

Phoenix As ATS Component  

Phoenix has been developed following the decomposition of ATS componentware (ATS CW): 
 ATS units shall be regarded as ""system of systems"",
e.g. a system for each decomposed domain. An ATS systems may consist of subsystems,
e.g. a ACC ATS system may consist of a subsystem ""Main"" and a subsystem ""Fallback"". ATS systems or subsystems always comprise Hardware (HW),
Software (SW), and Network Infrastructure (NET). HW, SW, NET consist of segments, e.g.
a HW segment is a single host,
a SW segment is the application SW for a host,
a NET segment is a LAN segment. SW segments consist of components,
Components are executable (UNIX/LINUX) processes and/or scripts

Phoenix Tracking Engineering 

PHOENIX includes a 2 track server configuration, one with an IMMKF and another with a 1MKF. Targets with different manoeuvrability have different statistics, which is expressed by the process noise of the motion model. The process noise is a mathematical description for the uncertainty of a future position and velocity target given the current and past observations. Targets for which constant motion is an established fact essentially have zero process noise, and all uncertainties due to changes to the targets’ motion state are modelled by nonzero process noise.

Phoenix Software Engineering 

PHOENIX is based on the use of Commercial Off-The-Shelf hardware and software, on the LINUX operating system, and on a modular Air Traffic Control (ATC) system philosophy. The existing system with its open architecture design is adaptable and scalable ranging from a simple tower automation application over a complex approach application up to an independent air traffic control fallback solution for a multi sector area control centre.

Phoenix Standards 

The development and evolution of the PHOENIX product has been based on compliance with internationally accepted standards for air traffic management systems including operational, safety, security and equipment standards promulgated by organisations such as ICAO, EUROCONTROL and other recognized organisations.

Owned by Inyo Broadcast Holdings, the station maintains offices on Banyan Boulevard in West Palm Beach, while its transmitter is located near Greenacres, Florida.

Until 2021, as the Ion owned-and-operated station for West Palm Beach, where Ion's headquarters are located, WPXP was considered one of the network's flagship stations, though it has never originated any content for the national network, either as Pax TV, i: Independent Television, or Ion.

History
The first application for the station was made in 1984, and the WHBI callsign was assigned in June 1987 until the end of 1997. In January 1998, it finally went on-air after more than a decade of modified and expired construction permits, and took its present call letters upon joining the fledgling Pax TV network.  All applications prior to 2003 were by Hispanic Broadcasting, Inc., before becoming Paxson West Palm Beach License, Inc. (a holding company, which is common in broadcasting), though there was no application listed to assign the station to another licensee.

WPXP and then-sister station WPXM-TV carried Florida Marlins baseball games from 2002 to 2005.

Technical information

Subchannels
The station's digital signal is multiplexed:

Analog-to-digital conversion
WPXP-TV discontinued regular programming on its analog signal, over UHF channel 67, on June 12, 2009, the official date in which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate (sister station WPXM opted to do so on the original transition date of February 17). The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 36. Through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers display the station's virtual channel as its former UHF analog channel 67, which was among the high band UHF channels (52-69) that were removed from broadcasting use as a result of the transition.

WPXP's digital signal has a much greater broadcast range than its now-defunct channel 67 analog signal. The analog transmitter was located within the western part of the city of West Palm Beach, and had a service contour that reached as far north as Port St. Lucie and as far south as Pompano Beach (immediately north of Fort Lauderdale). The digital transmitter is west-southwest of Lake Worth, and its service contour reaches as far north as Okeechobee and Fort Pierce, and far south as Kendale Lakes, including all of Palm Beach, Broward, and Martin counties; and northeast Miami-Dade, eastern Hendry, and southern/central St. Lucie counties.

It allows players to engage in Mafia-style wars with one another and has become one of the most lucrative Facebook applications and the first to net US$1M per month in revenue. However, this number has never been confirmed by the developer or any third parties.

Developed by David Maestri while he worked for Freewebs.com, it was subsequently the subject of an unsuccessful intellectual property lawsuit as Maestri's former employers attempted to claim ownership over the asset. The lawsuit was ultimately settled in December 2008 with the IP for Mob Wars remaining with Maestri but with SGN allowed to develop their own Mafia based role-playing application. In August 2008, Mob Wars had 2.5 million active users. It has spawned several very similar games with nearly identical gameplay and format on both Facebook and MySpace, some of which, such as Zynga's Mafia Wars, were the subject of further lawsuits.  Zynga made some changes to Mafia Wars so it wouldn't resemble Mob Wars as closely, but Mob Wars creator David Maestri moved forward with his lawsuit.  In September 2009, Maestri and Zynga settled the case for about $7–$9 million, less than the $10 million Maestri had originally demanded.

Gameplay 

Mob Wars is a simple role-playing game. There is no world for the player to move around in. The only type of character interaction the player experiences with other players, is either by sending them messages, weapons, and energy boosts, or attacking them. Like many Facebook applications, most of the gameplay revolves around having friends of the player join the player's mob through means made possible in the game.

The player starts off as a petty thief and works his way up to doing bigger and better paying jobs and heists. The player gains strength by equipping his mob with weapons, armor and vehicles. These can be drops from doing jobs and heists, gifts from friends, or they can be purchased with game money (earned by doing jobs, fighting other players, or as income from investments in properties.)

Favor Points (sub-currency also known as Godfather points) can be used to heal or gain more game money. They are slowly earned as the player levels up or can be gained quickly by participating in sponsor surveys or off-site membership purchases with a credit card.

Soon after the development of the game, alliances were formed by many players, to promote levelling and to organize group attacks, and to protect against those same tactics. Some families were more organized than others and these alliances would range from only a few players to hundreds. Eventually the game itself evolved to promote the family aspect of the game, giving each player's character the option of either staying on their own, creating their own family or joining another family. If the respective character is a member of an in-game family, they would be ""tagged"" with the family name, which would link to the family page, listing all of the mobsters in that respective family. Many of the original families created in-game family alternatives, but since they were limited to 50 members per family the groups lost many members to other newcomers. In 2012 the Family aspect of the game was improved to include a win–loss percentage in Wars.

The Maltese original, Bonaparti f'Malta, was published in 1997.

Citing contemporary documents from Malta's archives, it provides a detailed account of the six days Napoleon Bonaparte spent in Malta in 1798, as well as an analysis of the political situation under the Order of St John of Jerusalem and the political and cultural consequences of Bonaparte's conquest of Malta.

In the words of fellow writer and former Prime Minister of Malta, Alfred Sant, Napoleon and his impact on Malta were ""enduring subjects of [Sammut's] interests and research"".
 
It is the first account in the French language of those six days. At the Eighth Congress of the International Napoleonic Society, Sammut gave a presentation, ""The Enlightenment in Malta and the Coming of Bonaparte"", based on his research for Bonaparte à Malte.

Sammut maintained that Napoleon, despite spending such a short time in Malta, sought singlehandedly to draw the country into the modern world. He issued a series of decrees aimed at bringing about a thorough reorganization of government and society in Malta, and tirelessly sought to review the country's laws and regulations. The abolition of noble titles and privileges and the ending of slavery were the first measures he implemented. He ordered the expulsion of the Inquisitor and the release of the Order's political prisoners, including the Maltese patriot, Mikiel Anton Vassalli, who shared his Enlightenment ideals and whom he described as ""the most intelligent prisoner (ever) locked in a cell"". Voicing his surprise that fundamental subjects such as mathematics, physics and astronomy were not yet being taught at the University of Malta, he also instituted a series of educational reforms.

Sammut characterized Napoleon as ""a different kind of leader... more of an intellectual strategist and philosopher"", a quality placing him in the highest rank of commander together with Julius Caesar and Alexander the Great.

Some of Sammut's research for Bonaparte à Malte also went into his 1994 historical novel about Vassalli, Il-Ħolma Maltija (The Maltese Dream), described by Alfred Sant as ""his masterpiece"" and by British author and poet Marjorie Boulton as ""a colossal work"".

According to Prof. Anne-Marie Mésa of the University of Reims Champagne-Ardenne, Frans Sammut's ""point of view is actually original, well reasoned out, nuanced and subtle – as one would expect from all works on history. A true pleasure to read!”; Frans Sammut was “self-evidently an excellent historian, as well as a rich personality and endowed with a vast culture”.

This fifteen-element Dublin Core has been formally standardized as ISO 15836, ANSI/NISO Z39.85, and IETF RFC 5013. The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI), which formulates the Dublin
Core, is a project of the Association for Information Science and Technology (ASIS&T), a non-profit organization. The core properties are part of a larger set of DCMI Metadata Terms. ""Dublin Core"" is also used as an adjective for Dublin Core metadata, a style of metadata that draws on multiple Resource Description Framework (RDF) vocabularies, packaged and constrained in Dublin Core application profiles.

The resources described using the Dublin Core may be digital resources (video, images, web pages, etc.) as well as physical resources such as books or works of art.
Dublin Core metadata may be used for multiple purposes, from simple resource description to combining metadata vocabularies of different metadata standards, to providing interoperability for metadata vocabularies in the linked data cloud and Semantic Web implementations.

Background
""Dublin"" refers to Dublin, Ohio, USA where the schema originated during the 1995 invitational OCLC/NCSA Metadata Workshop, hosted by the OCLC (known at that time as Online Computer Library Center), a library consortium based in Dublin, and the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA). ""Core"" refers to the metadata terms as ""broad and generic being usable for describing a wide range of resources"". The semantics of Dublin Core were established and are maintained by an international, cross-disciplinary group of professionals from librarianship, computer science, text encoding, museums, and other related fields of scholarship and practice.

In 1999, the first Dublin Core encoding standard was in HTML. Starting in 2000, the Dublin Core community focused on ""application profiles"" – the idea that metadata records would use Dublin Core together with other specialized vocabularies to meet particular implementation requirements. During that time, the World Wide Web Consortium's work on a generic data model for metadata, the Resource Description Framework (RDF), was maturing. As part of an extended set of DCMI metadata terms, Dublin Core became one of the most popular vocabularies for use with RDF, more recently in the context of the linked data movement.

The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI) provides an open forum for the development of interoperable online metadata standards for a broad range of purposes and of business models. DCMI's activities include consensus-driven working groups, global conferences and workshops, standards liaison, and educational efforts to promote widespread acceptance of metadata standards and practices. In 2008, DCMI separated from OCLC and incorporated as an independent entity.

Currently, any and all changes that are made to the Dublin Core standard, are reviewed by a DCMI Usage Board within the context of a DCMI Namespace Policy (DCMI-NAMESPACE). This policy describes how terms are assigned and also sets limits on the amount of editorial changes allowed to the labels, definitions, and usage comments.

Levels of the standard
The Dublin Core standard originally included two levels: Simple and Qualified. Simple Dublin Core comprised 15 elements; Qualified Dublin Core included three additional elements (Audience, Provenance and RightsHolder), as well as a group of element refinements (also called qualifiers) that could refine the semantics of the elements in ways that may be useful in resource discovery.

Since 2012, the two have been incorporated into the DCMI Metadata Terms as a single set of terms using the RDF data model. The full set of elements is found under the namespace http://purl.org/dc/terms/. Because the definition of the terms often contains domains and ranges, which may not be compatible with the pre-RDF definitions used for the original 15 Dublin Core elements, there is a separate namespace for the original 15 elements as previously defined: http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/.

Dublin Core Metadata Element Set
The original DCMES Version 1.1 consists of 15 metadata elements, defined this way in the original specification:
 Contributor – ""An entity responsible for making contributions to the resource"".
 Coverage – ""The spatial or temporal topic of the resource, the spatial applicability of the resource, or the jurisdiction under which the resource is relevant"".
 Creator – ""An entity primarily responsible for making the resource"".
 Date – ""A point or period of time associated with an event in the lifecycle of the resource"".
 Description – ""An account of the resource"".
 Format – ""The file format, physical medium, or dimensions of the resource"".
 Identifier – ""An unambiguous reference to the resource within a given context"".
 Language – ""A language of the resource"".
 Publisher – ""An entity responsible for making the resource available"".
 Relation – ""A related resource"".
 Rights – ""Information about rights held in and over the resource"".
 Source – ""A related resource from which the described resource is derived"".
 Subject – ""The topic of the resource"".
 Title – ""A name given to the resource"".
 Type – ""The nature or genre of the resource"".

Each Dublin Core element is optional and may be repeated. The DCMI has established standard ways to refine elements and encourage the use of encoding and vocabulary schemes. There is no prescribed order in Dublin Core for presenting or using the elements. The Dublin Core became a NISO standards, Z39.85, and IETF RFC 5013 in 2007, ISO 15836 standard in 2009 and is used as a base-level data element set for the description of learning resources in the ISO/IEC 19788-2 Metadata for learning resources (MLR) – Part 2: Dublin Core elements, prepared by the ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 36.

Full information on element definitions and term relationships can be found in the Dublin Core Metadata Registry.

Encoding examples

Example of use [and mention] by WebCite
On the ""archive form"" web page for WebCite it says, in part: ""Metadata (optional): These are Dublin Core elements. [...]"".

Qualified Dublin Core
(Superseded in 2008 by the DCMI Metadata Terms.) Subsequent to the specification of the original 15 elements, an ongoing process to develop exemplary terms extending or refining the DCMES was begun. The additional terms were identified, generally in working groups of the DCMI, and judged by the DCMI Usage Board to be in conformance with principles of good practice for the qualification of Dublin Core metadata elements.

Element refinements make the meaning of an element narrower or more specific. A refined element shares the meaning of the unqualified element, but with a more restricted scope. The guiding principle for the qualification of Dublin Core elements, colloquially known as the Dumb-Down Principle, states that an application that does not understand a specific element refinement term should be able to ignore the qualifier and treat the metadata value as if it were an unqualified (broader) element. While this may result in some loss of specificity, the remaining element value (without the qualifier) should continue to be generally correct and useful for discovery.

In addition to element refinements, Qualified Dublin Core includes a set of recommended encoding schemes, designed to aid in the interpretation of an element value. These schemes include controlled vocabularies and formal notations or parsing rules. A value expressed using an encoding scheme may thus be a token selected from a controlled vocabulary (for example, a term from a classification system or set of subject headings) or a string formatted in accordance with a formal notation, for example, ""2000-12-31"" as the ISO standard expression of a date. If an encoding scheme is not understood by an application, the value may still be useful to a human reader.

Audience, Provenance and RightsHolder are elements, but not part of the Simple Dublin Core 15 elements. Use Audience, Provenance and RightsHolder only when using Qualified Dublin Core. DCMI also maintains a small, general vocabulary recommended for use within the element Type. This vocabulary currently consists of 12 terms.

DCMI Metadata Terms
The DCMI Metadata Terms lists the current set of the Dublin Core vocabulary. This set includes the fifteen terms of the DCMES (in italic), as well as the qualified terms. Each term has a unique URI in the namespace http://purl.org/dc/terms, and all are defined as RDF properties.

Syntax
Syntax choices for metadata expressed with the Dublin Core elements depend on context. Dublin Core concepts and semantics are designed to be syntax independent and apply to a variety of contexts, as long as the metadata is in a form suitable for interpretation by both machines and people.

The Dublin Core Abstract Model provides a reference model against which particular Dublin Core encoding guidelines can be compared, independent of any particular encoding syntax. Such a reference model helps implementers get a better understanding of the kinds of descriptions they are trying to encode and facilitates the development of better mappings and translations between different syntaxes.

It is Cohen's debut novel.

History and background
Leslie Cohen studied fiction at Columbia University. The characters in the novel are based loosely on Cohen's friends and roommates while at Columbia. Cohen was born and raised in New York. Various addresses and neighborhoods in the city play an important part in the unfolding of the plot.

Plot summary
Eve Porter is an undergraduate Columbia student studying journalism living on Columbia's Morningside Heights East Campus between 117th and 118th streets with her roommates. She is originally from the Bronx where she and her mother and sister lived until her father left them when she was 13. She later moved to the Upper East Side when her mother started dating her step-father Arthur. Eve's mother worked in the  World Trade Center as a receptionist for a law firm before she dies during the September 11 Attacks.

Eve and her roommates throw a party where Ben and Eve have one of their first interactions in the novel. Eve doesn't think of much and keeps her mind set on her romantic interest at the time, Jesse. Jesse is a Columbia student who is an aspiring musician. Jesse and Eve have a tumultuous relationship due to both of their strong personalities as well as Jesse's drug and alcohol use. Ben and Eve share their second encounter while they are both out at a tiki bar in New York. Ben lives in Hoboken, New Jersey and is working as a structural and civil engineer for Skidmore, Owings & Merrill. Ben and Eve have little interaction at the bar, but he listens into Eve and Jesse's breakup as he is walking back from the bar on the Lower East Side.

Eve is working as an assistant at an asset management firm after one of the publication she is working for goes out of business. Following her break up with Jesse, Eve applies for a job at a newspaper in Colorado. At this point in the novel, Eve has a very negative view of New York due to her past experiences and decides it is time for a change of scenery.

Three years later Eve returns to New York after she feels that she has finally had the chance to ""really live"" in Colorado. She gets a new job working at a music sharing program as a journalist, and she is living in a studio in the East Village. Eve meets up with her college friends and roommates, Maya and Kate, along with Ben's group of friends at a restaurant. After having a lot to drink, Eve and Ben go on the balcony and have their first real conversation. Ben wakes up the next morning in Eve's apartment. He invites her to breakfast and halfway through Eve rushes out feeling that breakfast means Ben wants a serious relationship. After Eve leaves, Ben finds a business card under Eve's seat that belonged to her mother. Ben pieces together that Eve's mother worked for his father and is responsible for getting him out of the building during the attacks. Ben feels guilty since his father feels partially responsible for her death.

Three weeks later Ben is getting pizza, and he runs into Eve about to go to a concert to review for her job. Eve explains why she left at breakfast and invites Ben to come with her. After the concert while they are trying to get backstage, Ben gives back the card, and Eve confirms that it was in fact her mother's. A few months down the line, Eve loses her job due to the website closing down, and she and Ben start officially dating.

After Eve sees her father for the first time after he left, Ben finally decides to tell Eve how he knows her mother. Eve is upset he didn't tell her sooner. At a wedding later on, Ben is in Chicago and Eve goes without him. Eve runs into Jesse there, and they get to catching up. They sneak off to an empty room at the venue, but Eve stops before things get out of hand. Feeling guilty, she tells Ben what happened. and they break up.

Eve moves out after the break up and moves in with her step-father on the Park Avenue. She finds a new job, and on her way to work she runs into one of Ben's old friends. They plot a way for Eve and Ben to get back together after Eve discovers he has a new girlfriend. The plan falls through, but then after finding an old note that Eve wrote, Ben comes looking for Eve and he forgives her.

Reception
Several publications including People Magazine, The New York Post and Bustle gave the novel positive reviews. Booklist named the book one of the Top 10 Romance Debuts of 2018. It was also named one of Buzzfeed's “31 Books That Portray Love In A Realistic Way” and received a starred review from Kirkus Reviews.

The book and its author have been frequently compared to Nora Ephron, by Kirkus Reviews, which said: “An edgy, updated take on Nora Ephron that's full of humor and wit.” Book Reporter also referenced the comparisons, and stated: “Cohen’s debut is a traditional romance with a contemporary twist, a truly 21st-century love story that’s as complex and challenging as the times in which it’s set.” Booklist wrote: “When Harry Met Sally for a new generation, with all the humor, heart, and smarts that writing neo-Ephron entails.” And the New York Post stated, ""Think When Harry Met Sally... updated."".

The standard has extended throughput to up to 54 Mbit/s using the same 20 MHz bandwidth as 802.11b uses to achieve 11 Mbit/s.  This specification under the marketing name of Wi-Fi has been implemented all over the world.  The 802.11g protocol is now Clause 19 of the published IEEE 802.11-2007 standard, and Clause 19 of the published IEEE 802.11-2012 standard.

802.11 is a set of IEEE standards that govern wireless networking transmission methods. They are commonly used today in their 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g, 802.11n, 802.11ac and 802.11ax versions to provide wireless connectivity in the home, office and some commercial establishments.

802.11g is fully backward compatible with 802.11b.

Descriptions 
802.11g is the third modulation standard for wireless LANs.  It works in the 2.4 GHz band (like 802.11b) but operates at a maximum raw data rate of 54 Mbit/s. Using the CSMA/CA transmission scheme, 31.4 Mbit/s is the maximum net throughput possible for packets of 1500 bytes in size and a 54 Mbit/s wireless rate (identical to 802.11a core, except for some additional legacy overhead for backward compatibility). In practice, access points may not have an ideal implementation and may therefore not be able to achieve even 31.4 Mbit/s throughput with 1500 byte packets. 1500 bytes is the usual limit for packets on the Internet and therefore a relevant size to benchmark against. Smaller packets give even lower theoretical throughput, down to 3 Mbit/s using 54 Mbit/s rate and 64 byte packets. Also, the available throughput is shared between all stations transmitting, including the AP so both downstream and upstream traffic is limited to a shared total of 31.4 Mbit/s using 1500 byte packets and 54 Mbit/s rate.

802.11g hardware is fully backward compatible with 802.11b hardware. Details of making b and g work well together occupied much of the lingering technical process. In an 802.11g network, however, the presence of a legacy 802.11b participant will significantly reduce the speed of the overall 802.11g network. Some 802.11g routers employ a back-compatible mode for 802.11b clients called 54g LRS (Limited Rate Support).

The modulation scheme used in 802.11g is orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) copied from 802.11a with data rates of 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, and 54 Mbit/s, and reverts to CCK (like the 802.11b standard) for 5.5 and 11 Mbit/s and DBPSK/DQPSK+DSSS for 1 and 2 Mbit/s.  Even though 802.11g operates in the same frequency band as 802.11b, it can achieve higher data rates because of its heritage to 802.11a.

Technical description 
Of the 52 OFDM subcarriers, 48 are for data and 4 are pilot subcarriers with a carrier separation of 0.3125 MHz (20 MHz/64). Each of these subcarriers can be a BPSK, QPSK, 16-QAM or 64-QAM. The total bandwidth is 22 MHz with an occupied bandwidth of 16.6 MHz. Symbol duration is 4 microseconds, which includes a guard interval of 0.8 microseconds. The actual generation and decoding of orthogonal components is done in baseband using DSP which is then upconverted to 2.4 GHz at the transmitter. Each of the subcarriers could be represented as a complex number. The time domain signal is generated by taking an Inverse Fast Fourier transform (IFFT). Correspondingly the receiver downconverts, samples at 20 MHz and does an FFT to retrieve the original coefficients. The advantages of using OFDM include reduced multipath effects in reception and increased spectral efficiency.

Adoption
The then-proposed 802.11g standard was rapidly adopted by consumers starting in January 2003, well before ratification, due to the desire for higher speeds and reductions in manufacturing costs. By mid-2003, most dual-band 802.11a/b products became dual-band/tri-mode, supporting a and b/g in a single mobile adapter card or access point. 

Despite its major acceptance, 802.11g suffers from the same interference as 802.11b in the already crowded 2.4 GHz range.  Devices operating in this range include microwave ovens, Bluetooth devices, baby monitors, and digital cordless telephones, which can lead to interference issues.  Additionally, the success of the standard has caused usage/density problems related to crowding in urban areas.  To prevent interference, there are only three non-overlapping usable channels in the U.S. and other countries with similar regulations (channels 1, 6, 11, with 25 MHz separation), and four in Europe (channels 1, 5, 9, 13, with only 20 MHz separation). Even with such separation, some interference due to side lobes exists, though it is considerably weaker.

The most celebrated of these, a manuscript volume which incorporates a considerable amount of heraldic and genealogical material as well as the inventory itself, is sometimes known as the ""Red Velvet Book"" (from its later binding), and sometimes simply as ""the Lumley Inventory"". It is often dated to 1590, although it is in reality a more complex composite volume including material dating from 1586 to 1595. Further inventories were drawn up for purposes of probate on Lord Lumley's death in 1609; and others when parts of the collection were sold in the 18th and early 19th centuries.

The inventories

The greater part of the Red Velvet Book comprises genealogical material, reflecting Lumley's fascination with his own ancestry. The earliest and most extensive pedigree, which charts the Lumley descent from a Saxon nobleman named Liulph, is dated 1586, and has been identified as the work of Robert Glover, Somerset Herald.

The main inventory records the household contents, including artworks, at Lumley's residences of Nonsuch Palace, Surrey, Lumley Castle, County Durham, and at Hart Street, Tower Hill, London. It was prepared by John Lampton, Lumley's steward, and is dated 22 May 1590, at the time that Lumley was beginning to negotiate the sale of Nonsuch to Queen Elizabeth. The volume also includes coloured drawings, probably also made in about 1590, showing monuments, furniture and architectural elements at Nonsuch and Lumley Castle (some of which can still be seen at Lumley Castle), and three tomb monuments commissioned by Lumley for himself and his two wives in the Lumley Chapel at Cheam, Surrey. There is also a textual description of Lumley Castle. Additions to the contents of the volume are dated to as late as 1595.

A catalogue of Lumley's library of some 3,000 volumes was prepared by Anthony Alcock (a member of the household of Lumley's protégé Anthony Watson) in 1596. Another inventory of the pictures at Lumley Castle, and a revised catalogue of the library, were drawn up following Lumley's death in April 1609. Further inventories of paintings were compiled for the sales of much of the collection in 1785 and 1807.

History of the Lumley collections
 

The Lumley Inventories demonstrate Lumley's passion for collecting portraits. His collection was the largest in Elizabethan England and was housed in three of his residences – his house on Tower Hill as well as Lumley Castle and Nonsuch Palace. The collection included portraits of 196 contemporary sitters, and (unlike most inventories of the period) often named the painter.

The nucleus of the collection was acquired from his father-in-law, Henry Fitzalan, 19th Earl of Arundel. A dozen or so pictures from the collection of the Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester were incorporated into the Lumley collection. The collection included a portrait of Lady Jane Grey which may subsequently have become part of the Northwick Park Collection, although it was said to be of Catherine Parr.

Lord Lumley was the uncle of Thomas Howard, 21st Earl of Arundel, a prominent connoisseur in the early 17th century. Arundel inherited some of Lumley's collection of paintings, including the portrait of the Duchess of Milan, now in the National Gallery. However, a considerable portion of the collection went to Lumley Castle and remained there, eventually being inherited by the Earls of Scarbrough. The Lumley collection of paintings was largely dispersed in sales that took place in 1785 and 1807. Many works from the inventories can be recognised by distinctive cartellini (trompe-l'œil representations of inscribed labels) added to some – but not all – of the paintings. An example of the cartellino can be seen on the portrait of Edward VI, after Holbein.

The bulk of Lumley's library passed on his death as a gift to Henry, Prince of Wales, and in due course to the British Museum (now the British Library) in 1757.

Scholarly awareness and publication
The first antiquarian to become aware of the Red Velvet Book was George Vertue, who mentioned it in notes made in 1735. Shortly afterwards it was also noted by Horace Walpole. An edited version of the 1609 inventory of paintings was published in Robert Surtees’ History and Antiquities of the County Palatine of Durham in 1820.

The textual content of the Red Velvet Book (excluding the genealogical material and the drawings) was published in 1904 by Edith Milner in her book Records of the Lumleys of Lumley Castle. It was published again, omitting the description of Lumley Castle but including 20 monochrome plates of the drawings, by Lionel Cust in 1918 in the sixth volume of the Walpole Society. Cust also included four of the later (much shorter) inventories, one undated, one of 1785, and two of 1807. In the same volume, Mary Hervey published the 1609 inventory of paintings in full.

The 1609 library catalogue was published by Sears Jayne and Francis Johnson in 1956.

The Red Velvet Book in its entirety was published in a limited edition by the Roxburghe Club in 2010, in full colour facsimile and accompanied by twelve scholarly contextual essays, under the editorship of Mark Evans.

Use of the inventories in art history
The inventories have been described as ""the most important documents in the history of English art in the second half of the sixteenth century"". The 1590 inventory contains valuable information respecting early historical portraits in England, and has been used to identify a number of artists operating in England during the reign of Elizabeth I. Using information from the 1590 inventory, Lionel Cust was able to establish that the painter using the monogram HE was Hans Eworth. Sir David Piper identified more than twenty paintings on which the cartellino can still be seen. He also put forward the view that the phrase ""done by Seigar"" in the 1590 inventory referred to the portrait of Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex in the National Gallery of Ireland.

He is known as the author of a 1587 book, written in Latin, that was the first work published in England on swimming; and also as a philosophical teacher, writer and controversialist. The swimming book, De Arte Natandi, was a practical treatise following a trend begun by the archery book Toxophilus of Roger Ascham, of Digby's own college.

According to Eugene D. Hill, in Digby's Theoria Analytica of 1579,

Life

Born about 1550, he matriculated as a sizar of St John's College, Cambridge, 25 October 1567; was admitted a scholar 9 November 1570; proceeded B. A. 1570-1, M.A. 1574, and B.D. 1581; and became a Lady Margaret fellow on 12 March 1572-3, and senior fellow 10 July 1585. He was principal lecturer in 1584. Digby took part in the college performance of Thomas Legge's Richardus Tertius in 1580.

Before the end of 1587 he was deprived of his fellowship. In a letter to Chancellor of the University Lord Burghley, William Whitaker, master of St John's College (4 April 1588), explained that this step had been rendered necessary by Digby's arrears with the college steward. He added that Digby had preached voluntary poverty, a 'popish position,' at St Mary's; had attacked Calvinists as schismatics; was in the habit of blowing a horn and hallooing in the college during the daytime, and repeatedly spoke of the master to the scholars with the greatest disrespect. Burghley and John Whitgift ordered Digby's restitution; but Whitaker stood firm, and with the support of the Earl of Leicester obtained confirmation of the expulsion.

Writings and controversy
Digby's best known book is a treatise on swimming, the earliest published in England. De Arte Natandi is illustrated with plates, and was translated into English by Christopher Middleton in 1595 as A Short Introduction for to Learne to Swimme. This biomechanics of swimming is considered the best swimming book for over 300 years. It deals with the specific weight of objects and humans.

Digby also wrote a work against Ramism and his own system, Theoria analytica, dedicated to Sir Christopher Hatton, 1579. William Temple of King's College, Cambridge, wrote, under the pseudonym of Franciscus Mildapettus, an attack on Digby's criticism of Petrus Ramus, to which Digby replied in 1580. Temple replied again in 1581.

As the productions of a predecessor of Francis Bacon, Digby's two philosophical books are notable, although clumsy in expression and overlaid with scholastic subtleties. Digby tried in his Theoria Analytica to classify the sciences, and elsewhere ventures on a theory of perception based on the notion of the active correspondence of mind and matter. Otherwise Digby is a disciple of Aristotle.

Digby was also author of Everard Digbie, his Dissuasive from taking away the Lyvings and Goods of the Church, with Celsus of Verona, his Dissuasive, translated into English, London, 1589, dedicated to Sir Christopher Hatton.

Lidell was formerly a part of Super Collider.

Career
Lidell is known for layering tracks made with his voice into a microphone and performing the percussion and melody as a sequenced, beatboxing one-man band. Then over his augmented voices, he sings soul-inspired songs. This exercise makes for energetic live performances. Lidell has become renowned for his diverse range of genre-exploration. Following the release of his 2008 album, Jim, Lidell commented, I want it to be about music, I think every musician does. But I think inevitably it ends up becoming about personality, which is what gives rise to the music, so people want to make sure that they get a bit of both. The more things do well, the more people want to know why it does well.

His song ""Multiply"" was used on the television show Grey's Anatomy, and was also included on its second soundtrack. Another song from his album Multiply, ""A Little Bit More"", was featured in a series of commercials for the U.S. retailer Target.

He often collaborates with Canadian musicians such as Gonzales, Feist and Mocky. In 2009 he collaborated with British electronic duo Simian Mobile Disco for the song ""Off the Map"". In 2006, he was part of a live performance collaboration with David Link and F. M. Einheit, which was released on CD as Echohce.  In 2001, he provided vocals for the Lo Fidelity Allstars track ""Deep Ellum...Hold On"", from their CD Don't Be Afraid of Love.

In early 2009, Lidell's Jim won in the 8th Annual Independent Music Awards for Best Pop/Rock Album.

In 2009, he contributed a cover of Grizzly Bear's song ""Little Brother"" to the Warp20 (Recreated) compilation, as well as having his song ""A Little Bit More"" covered by Tim Exile.

In March 2010, Lidell announced that he was releasing a new album entitled Compass which was produced by fellow musician and occasional collaborator Beck. The album was released in May 2010. The title track is featured in the Rockstar video game Red Dead Redemption.

Lidell was the co-writer and vocalist for the Simian Mobile Disco track ""Put Your Hands Together"", from their 2012 album Unpatterns.

The object of the game is to assemble molecules from compound atoms by moving the atoms on a two-dimensional playfield.

Atomix was received positively; reviewers noted the game's addictiveness and enjoyable gameplay, though criticized its repetitiveness.

Gameplay

Atomix takes place on a playfield consisting of a number of walls, with the atoms scattered throughout. The player is tasked with assembling a molecule from the atoms. The atoms must be arranged to exactly match the molecule displayed on the left side of the screen. The player can choose an atom and move it in any of the four cardinal directions. A moved atom keeps sliding in one direction until it hits a wall or another atom. Solving the puzzles requires strategic planning in moving the atoms, and on later levels with little free space, even finding room for the completed molecule can be a problem. Once the molecule is assembled, the player is given a score; the faster the puzzle was completed, the higher the score.

Each puzzle must be completed within a time limit. A portion of the player's score can be spent to restart a failed puzzle. The entire game consists of 30 puzzles of increasing difficulty. In addition, after every five puzzles, there is a bonus level where the player must move laboratory flasks filled with various amounts of liquid to arrange them from empty to full.

The game also offers a two-player mode, where two players work on the same puzzle; they take turns which last up to thirty seconds.

Development

Amiga Format reviewed a pre-release version in its May, 1990 issue. It was almost a complete version of the game although it lacked sound.

Initially the game was released for Amiga, Atari ST and the IBM PC; as of May 1990, the C64 version was not yet planned, and was only released a few months later. A ZX Spectrum version was also planned. It was to be distributed by U.S. Gold, but was never released.

The game was published for Enterprise 128 in 2006, this version was written by Zoltán Povázsay from Hungary.

A clone for the Atari Jaguar called Atomic has been released in 2006, written by Sébastien Briais (AKA Seb from the Removers). A second version called Atomic Reloaded has been released in 2009.

Reception

Atomix received warm reactions from reviewers. They stated it was highly enjoyable and addictive despite its high difficulty level. Reviewers also pointed out the possible educational application of the game.

However, certain reviewers criticized the game for its repetitiveness and stated that it lacked replayability. Some reviewers also wrote about the game's unoriginality, noting similarities to earlier games, Xor and Leonardo.

Graphics were generally considered adequate, though not spectacular; Zzap!64 called them ""a bit dull and repetitive"" and ""simplistic, but slick and effective"", while CU Amiga remarked that despite their simplicity, they ""create a nice, tidy display"". The soundtrack was found enjoyable, though the Commodore Format reviewer considered it annoyingly repetitive.

Atomix has been the subject of scientific research in computational complexity theory. When generalized to puzzles of arbitrary sizes, the problem of determining whether an Atomix puzzle has a solution is PSPACE-complete. Some heuristic approaches have been considered.

Legacy

Several open source clones of Atomix exist : Atomiks, GNOME Atomix, KAtomic and WAtomic.

It centers on Nina, a disorganized girl who has the unnatural ability to stay awake and think coherently in her dreams.

Plot summary
Nina is a young woman whose life is in disarray. She has trouble holding and finding jobs, difficulty with boyfriends, and is constantly on the verge of eviction due to unpaid rent. She has a strange condition which she likens to Alice in Wonderland, in which she is somehow able to stay awake and function rationally while in a dream state. While in her dream world she often tries to uncover clues for getting rich quickly, as it is revealed that in one dream several years ago she sang the numbers to a winning lottery ticket only to later disregard it as silly and thus miss out on a windfall.

In the second volume it is revealed that other people share the same dream world as Nina, and she can interact with them though they usually don't remember. Nina saves a small child having a nightmare from a scary monster, and then subliminally plants orders on a rich person to accidentally leave her an envelope filled with cash at her favorite diner.

Style
The comic has a  storyboard sketch-like style. All images are done in pencil and frequently left in their rough draft state. Rather than a consistent panel layout Paper Biscuit experiments with panel size, shape, and placement to assist in story telling. Dream panels tend to have stranger shapes, while waking life panels tend to be more rectangular and standard.

He also wrote a number of hymns including Our God, to Whom we turn.   He would later play a major role in the No-Conscription Fellowship, an organization that united and supported conscientious objectors in Britain during World War One.

Early career
Grubb was born in Sudbury, Suffolk, educated at Bootham School, York and studied at the University of Leeds and University of London.   He began his career as a teacher when he returned to Bootham School in York, England. Bootham is a boarding school for boys of the Religious Society of Friends. Grubb had attended the school himself, beginning in 1868 at the age of fourteen. He would later move on to teach at a number of other schools, including other Quaker schools. He received his B.A. in 1876 and in 1877 married Emma M. Horsnail of Bulford Mill, who he had courted for seven years.

Struggles with faith and science
While preparing for his M.A. examination in 1879, he had a crisis of faith resulting from his inability to reconcile science with the religious beliefs he had grown up with. He initially found it impossible to see how any serious intellectual could also be religious. He did not find any satisfaction in agnosticism; however, and remained open to a solution to his intellectual problems that included belief in God. In the 1880s Grubb began to develop an interest in social concerns, even cutting back on his teaching in order to devote time to the study of economics and to public work. In keeping with his desire to reconcile faith with science, Grubb was among those who vocally and successfully opposed the adoption of the Richmond Declaration by London Yearly Meeting in 1888. Soon after, as a result of his regular participation in meeting for worship, Grubb was officially recorded as a minister in the Religious Society of Friends. At the time, he still did not feel he had a firm basis for his faith, but was confident that it would come with time.

Major contributions
Grubb would go on to be a major leader of British Quakerism, a prolific religious author, and a key member of a number of religious and social organizations, including the No-Conscription Fellowship.  Like most pacifists of his generation, his absolute pacifist stance was born from the disillusionment with the Boer War.  From 1901 to 1906 he was secretary of the Howard Association.

Death and final resting place
The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography records that Grubb was buried on 26 January 1939 at the Hitchin Quaker burial ground.  However, the Hertford & Hitchin Monthly Meeting minutes of 4 February 1939 state quite clearly: ""He was cremated at Golders Green 27th 1. 39., the death having been registered at Letchworth 25th 1st mo. 1939"".

History

Electric Boat

General Dynamics traces its ancestry to John Philip Holland's Holland Torpedo Boat Company. In 1899, Isaac Rice bought the company from Holland and renamed it Electric Boat Company. Electric Boat was responsible for developing the U.S. Navy's first modern submarines which were purchased by the Navy in 1900.

In 1906, Electric Boat subcontracted submarine construction to the Fore River Shipyard in Quincy, Massachusetts, to build the submarines they had designed and won contracts for. Between 1917 and 1924, the company was named Submarine Boat Corporation. In 1933 Electric Boat acquired ownership of a shipyard in Groton, Connecticut, to build submarines. The first submarine built in Groton to be delivered to the U.S. Navy was the USS Cuttlefish in 1934.

Electric Boat was cash-flush but lacking in work following World War II, during which it produced 80 submarines for the Navy, with its workforce shrinking from 13,000 to 4,000 by 1946. President and chief executive officer John Jay Hopkins started looking for companies that would fit into Electric Boat's market in hopes of diversifying.

Canadair purchase
Canadair was owned by the Canadian government and was suffering from the same post-war malaise as Electric Boat. It was up for sale, and Hopkins bought the company for $10 million in 1946. The factory alone was worth more than $22 million, according to the Canadian government's calculations, excluding the value of the remaining contracts for planes or spare parts. However, Canadair's production line and inventory systems were in disorder when Electric Boat purchased the company. Hopkins hired Canadian-born mass-production specialist H. Oliver West to take over the president's role and return Canadair to profitability. Shortly after the takeover, Canadair began delivering its new Canadair North Star (a version of the Douglas DC-4) and was able to deliver aircraft to Trans-Canada Airlines, Canadian Pacific Airlines, and British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) well in advance of their contracted delivery times.

Defense spending increased with the onset of the Cold War, and Canadair went on to win many Canadian military contracts for the Royal Canadian Air Force and became a major aerospace company. These included Canadair CT-133 Silver Star trainer, the Canadair Argus long-range maritime reconnaissance and transport aircraft, and the Canadair F-86 Sabre. Between 1950 and 1958, 1,815 Sabres were built.  Canadair also produced 200 CF-104 Starfighter supersonic fighter aircraft, a license-built version of the Lockheed F-104.

In 1976, General Dynamics sold Canadair to the Canadian Government for $38 million. Canadair was acquired by Bombardier Inc. in 1986.

General Dynamics emerges
Aircraft production became increasingly important at Canadair, and Hopkins argued that the name ""Electric Boat"" was no longer appropriate—so Electric Boat was reorganized as General Dynamics on 24 April 1952.

General Dynamics purchased Convair from the Atlas Group in March 1953. The sale was approved by government oversight with the provision that GD would continue to operate out of Air Force Plant 4 in Fort Worth, Texas. This factory had been set up in order to spread out strategic aircraft production and rented to Convair during the war to produce B-24 Liberator bombers.

General Dynamics purchased Liquid Carbonic Corporation in September 1957 and controlled it as a wholly owned subsidiary until being forced by a Federal antitrust ruling to spin it off to shareholders in January 1969.  Liquid Carbonic was then bought that same month by the Houston Natural Gas Company.

Convair worked as an independent division under the General Dynamics umbrella. Over the next decade, the company introduced the F-106 Delta Dart Interceptor, the B-58 Hustler, and the Convair 880 and 990 airliners. Convair also introduced the Atlas missile platform, the first operational intercontinental ballistic missile.

Management churn
Hopkins fell seriously ill during 1957 and was eventually replaced by Frank Pace later that year. Meanwhile, John Naish succeeded Joseph McNarney as president of Convair. Chicago industrialist Henry Crown became the company's largest shareholder and merged his Material Service Corporation with GD in 1959.

GD subsequently reorganized into Eastern Group in New York City and Western Group in San Diego, California, with the latter taking over all of the aerospace activities and dropping the Convair brand name from its aircraft in the process.

Frank Pace retired under pressure in 1962 and Roger Lewis, former Assistant Secretary of the Air Force and Pan American Airways CEO, was brought in as CEO.  The company recovered, then fell back into the same struggles.  In 1970, the board brought in McDonnell Douglas president Dave Lewis (no relation) as chairman and CEO, who served until retiring in 1985.

Aviation powerhouse
During the early 1960s the company bid on the United States Air Force's Tactical Fighter, Experimental (TFX) project for a new low-level ""penetrator"". Robert McNamara, newly installed as the Secretary of Defense, forced a merger of the TFX with U.S. Navy plans for a new long-range ""fleet defender"" aircraft. In order to bid on a naval version successfully, GD partnered with Grumman, which would build a customized version for aircraft carrier duties. After four rounds of bids and changes, the GD/Grumman team finally won the contract over a Boeing submission.

The F-111 that resulted first flew in December 1964. The F-111B flew in May 1965, but the navy said that it was too heavy for use on aircraft carriers. With an unacceptable navy version, estimates for 2,400 F-111s, including exports, were sharply reduced, but GD still managed to make a $300-million profit on the project. Grumman went on to use many of the innovations of the F-111 in the highly successful F-14 Tomcat, an aircraft designed solely as a carrier-borne fighter.

Reorganization
In May 1965, GD reorganized into 12 operating divisions based on product lines. The board decided to build all future planes in Fort Worth, ending plane production at Convair's original plant in San Diego but continuing with space and missile development there. In October 1970, Roger Lewis left and David S. Lewis from McDonnell Douglas was named CEO. Lewis required that the company headquarters move to St. Louis, Missouri, which occurred in February 1971.

F-16 success

In 1972, GD bid on the USAF's Lightweight Fighter (LWF) project. GD and Northrop were awarded prototype contracts. GD's F-111 program was winding down, and the company desperately needed a new aircraft contract. It organized its own version of Lockheed's famed ""Skunk Works"", the Advanced Concepts Laboratory, and responded with a new aircraft design incorporating advanced technologies.

GD's YF-16 first flew in January 1974 and proved to have slightly better performance than the YF-17 in head-to-head testing. It entered production as the F-16 in January 1975 with an initial order of 650 and a total order of 1,388. The F-16 also won contracts worldwide, beating the F-17 in foreign competition as well. GD built an aircraft production factory in Fort Worth, Texas.  F-16 orders eventually totaled more than 4,600, making it the company's largest and most successful program, and one of the most successful western military projects since World War II.

Land Systems and Marine Systems focus

In 1976, General Dynamics sold the struggling Canadair back to the Canadian government for $38 million. By 1984, General Dynamics had four divisions: Convair in San Diego, General Dynamics-Fort Worth, General Dynamics-Pomona, and General Dynamics-Electronics. In 1985 a further reorganization created the Space Systems Division from the Convair Space division. In 1985, GD also acquired Cessna.  In 1986 the Pomona division (which mainly produced the Standard Missile and the Phalanx CIWS for the navy) was split up, creating the Valley Systems Division.  Valley Systems produced the Stinger surface-to-air missile and the Rolling Airframe Missile (RAM).  Both units were recombined into one entity in 1992.

Henry Crown, still GD's largest shareholder, died on 15 August 1990. Following this, the company started to rapidly divest its under-performing divisions under CEO William Anders. Cessna was re-sold to Textron in January 1992, the San Diego and Pomona missile production units to General Motors-Hughes Aerospace in May 1992, the Fort Worth aircraft production to Lockheed in March 1993 (a nearby electronics production facility was separately sold to Israeli-based Elbit Systems, marking that company's entry into the US market), and its Space Systems Division to Martin Marietta in 1994. The remaining Convair Aircraft Structure unit was sold to McDonnell Douglas in 1994. The remains of the Convair Division were simply closed in 1996. GD's exit from the aviation world was short-lived, and in 1999 the company acquired Gulfstream Aerospace.  The Pomona operation was closed shortly after its sale to Hughes Aircraft.

In 1995, General Dynamics purchased the privately held Bath Iron Works shipyard in Bath, Maine, for $300 million, diversifying its shipbuilding portfolio to include U.S. Navy surface ships such as guided-missile destroyers. In 1998, the company acquired NASSCO, formerly National Steel and Shipbuilding Company, for $415 million. The San Diego shipyard produces U.S. Navy auxiliary and support ships as well as commercial ships that are eligible to be U.S.-flagged under the Jones Act.

Having divested itself of its aviation holdings, GD concentrated on land and sea products. GD purchased Chrysler's defense divisions in 1982, renaming them General Dynamics Land Systems. In 2003, it purchased the defense divisions of General Motors as well. It is now a major supplier of armored vehicles of all types, including the M1 Abrams, LAV 25, Stryker, and a wide variety of vehicles based on these chassis.  Force Protection, Inc. was acquired by General Dynamics Land Systems in November 2011 for $350 million.

General Dynamics UK

In 1997, General Dynamics acquired Computing Devices Ltd based in Hastings, England which had developed avionics and mission systems for the Panavia Tornado, British Aerospace Harrier II and Hawker Siddeley Nimrod. In 2001, Computing Devices Canada (CDC) was awarded a contract from the UK Ministry of Defence to supply tactical communication systems for their Bowman program. The work for this was carried out at a newly established UK headquarters in Oakdale, Wales and the company was renamed General Dynamics UK Limited. Today, it comprises two business units: General Dynamics Land Systems - UK and General Dynamics Mission Systems - UK and it remains one of the UK's leading defense companies, operating out of a total of eight sites across the United Kingdom. It is currently responsible for delivering the General Dynamics Ajax family of armored vehicles, the Foxhound light protected patrol vehicle and the Morpheus communications system to the UK Ministry of Defence.

Recent history

In 2004, General Dynamics bid for the UK company Alvis plc, the leading British manufacturer of armored vehicles. In March the board of Alvis Vickers voted in favor of the £309m takeover. However at the last minute BAE Systems offered £355m for the company.  This deal was finalized in June 2004.

On August 19, 2008, GD agreed to pay $4 million to settle a lawsuit brought by the US Government claiming that a GD unit fraudulently billed the government for defectively manufactured parts used in US military aircraft and submarines.  The US alleged that GD defectively manufactured or failed to test parts used in US military aircraft from September 2001 to August 2003, such as for the C-141 Starlifter transport plane. The GD unit involved, based in Glen Cove, New York, closed in 2004.

In 2014, the government of Canada announced it had selected the General Dynamics Land Systems subsidiary in London, Ontario, to produce Light Armoured Vehicles for Saudi Arabia as part of a $10 billion deal with the Canadian Commercial Corporation.  The sale has been criticized by political opponents because of the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen. In December 2018, after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau suggested Canada might scrap the deal, the company warned that doing so could lead to ""billions of dollars in liability"" and risk the loss of thousands of jobs.  Trudeau has since said that while he is critical of Saudi conduct, he cannot simply scrap the deal because ""Canada as a country of the rule of law needs to respect its contracts.""  On 30 January 2019, CEO Phebe Novakovic warned investors that the matter had ""significantly impacted"" the company's cash flow because Saudi Arabia was nearly $2 billion in arrears on its payments.

In 2018, General Dynamics acquired information technology services giant CSRA for $9.7 billion, and merged it with GDIT.

General Dynamics has been accused by groups such as Code Pink and Green America of ""making money from human suffering by profiting off the migrant children held at U.S. detention camps"" due to its IT services contracts with the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Refugee Resettlement, the government agency that operates shelters for unaccompanied children to include those separated from their families as part of the Trump administration family separation policy. The company says it has no role in constructing or operating detention centers, and that its contracts to provide training and technical services began in 2000 and have spanned across four presidential administrations.

It was announced in September 2018 that the U.S. Navy awarded contracts for 10 new Arleigh Burke-class destroyers from General Dynamics Bath Iron Works and Huntington Ingalls Industries.

Former U.S. Secretary of Defense General Jim Mattis re-joined the company's board of directors in August 2019.  He had previously served on the board, but resigned and divested before becoming Secretary of Defense.

In September 2020, General Dynamics announced a strategic counter-drone partnership, providing General Dynamics' global network with access to Dedrone's complete drone detection and defeat technology.

In December 2020, the board of directors for General Dynamics announced a regular quarterly dividend of $1.10, payable on February 5, 2021.

On December 26, 2020, General Dynamics confirmed that their business division General Dynamics Land Systems was awarded a $4.6 billion contract by the U.S. Army for M1A2 SEPv3 Abrams main battle tanks.

It was the second staging of the World Snooker Championship. It was played on a challenge basis with the other six entrants playing off for the right to challenge defending champion Joe Davis in the final. The final was held at the Camkin's Hall in Birmingham, England, with three of the other matches contested there, and one each played in Leamington Spa and Nottingham.

Davis won 16–13 in the final against Fred Lawrence, and retained the title. Davis had won the professional billiards championship earlier in May, and became the first person to hold the professional titles in billiards and snooker titles concurrently, and then the first person to win them both in the same season. The highest  of the snooker tournament was 46, compiled by Alec Mann in the third  of his first round match against Albert Cope.

Background
Professional English billiards player and billiard hall manager Joe Davis had noticed the increasing popularity of snooker compared to billiards in the 1920s, and with Birmingham-based billiard hall manager Bill Camkin, who had also seen snooker's increasing appeal, persuaded the Billiards Association and Control Council (BACC) to recognise an official professional snooker championship in the 1926–27 season. The inaugural event was won by Davis, who defeated Tom Dennis 20–11 in the final. Originally called the Professional Championship of Snooker, the annual competition was not titled the World Championship until 1935, but the 1927 tournament is  now referred to as the first World Snooker Championship.

For the 1928 championship, a qualifying competition was held to produce a challenger to Davis, the defending champion. Most of the rules of the competition were as per the previous year, except that the preliminary rounds were to be played over 23  (rather than the 15 in 1927). Entry fees would be used to provide prize money for the finalists, with 60 per cent going to the champion. As a trophy had been purchased the previous year, there was no need to deduct money from entry fees to buy one, unlike at the first staging. The venue for the semi-finals and final was to be Camkin's Hall, Birmingham, with those matches supervised by the Midland Counties Billiard Association, and the players concerned would be left to arrange the locations for earlier rounds. The entry fee was set at five guineas per player (), with a five-guineas sidestake required. The Billiards Championship had been contested on a similar basis, with qualifying matches to produce a challenger to the champion, previously, and the system continued for that competition as well, but with an entry fee of £50 for the preliminary rounds, .

The closing date for entries for the snooker championship was 1 November 1927. There were seven entrants: Davis, Dennis, Tom Newman, Fred Smith, Albert Cope, Alec Mann, and Fred Lawrence.

Summary
The first match played was between Tom Newman and Fred Smith at the Albert Hall, Kenilworth Street, Leamington Spa from 28 to 30 December. Newman led 7–1 after the first day and 10–6 at the end of the second day. Newman won the first two frames on the final day to secure victory at 12–6.

Alec Mann compiled a  of 46 in the third frame against Albert Cope and made a 23 break at his following visit. During that frame he conceded points from five successive  shots, and more from two later fouls, finally winning the frame by 107 points to 42. The match was 2–2 at the first interval, before Mann took three of the next four to lead 5–3 after the first day. On the second day, Mann added the first four frames, with Cope subsequently recovering from 3–9 to 6–10,
and on the third day secured the win at 12–8. The three ""dead"" frames were played, resulting in a final score of 14–9 to Mann. Mann's break of 46 was the highest made in the 1928 tournament.

On 16 January, the day after he had eliminated Cope, Mann's match against Fred Lawrence commenced. Mann obtained a 3–1 lead, before the first day finished at 4–4. Lawrence took a 7–5 lead, and after the players each added a further two frames, was 9–7 ahead going into the last day. After the first  on the third day, Lawrence led 11–9, but Mann won the following frame, and added the almost 50-minute long 22nd frame. In the , Lawrence led by 17 points to 4, before a 21 break from Mann. Lawrence, through  play and , gained penalty points conceded by Mann and won the frame with a 20 break from the  to the .

The match between Tom Dennis and Newman was played from 29 to 31 March at The Lounge, Shakespeare Street, Nottingham. Newman took a 5–3 lead on the first day and increased this to 11–5 after two days, just one frame from victory. Newman won the first frame on the final day to take a winning 12–5 lead. The evening session was rearranged to include a billiards match as well as a frame of snooker.

Newman and Lawrence met in Birmingham from 7 to 9 May. Lawrence led 6–2 after the first day. From 5–9, Newman won the last two frames on the second day to reduce Lawrence's lead to 9–7 but Lawrence progressed to the final against Davis by securing the first three frames on the final day to win the match 12–7.

On 5 May, Davis became the professional English billiards champion for the first time, defeating Newman 16,000 – 14,874,  making sixty  in the last professional final to be played with ivory balls. Davis thereby became the first player to hold the professional titles in both billiards and snooker, an achievement not matched until his brother Fred Davis won the billiards championship in 1980.

Final
The final between Davis and  Lawrence was played from 14 to 17 May in Camkin's Hall in Birmingham. Lawrence and Davis shared the opening four frames in the afternoon session for 2–2, but Davis won all four frames in the evening to lead 6–2 after the first day. Lawrence won three frames on the second evening but Davis still led 9–7 after two days play. Three consecutive frame victories on the third afternoon helped Davis obtain a 14–10 after the third day, needing just two frames on the final day. Lawrence won three of the four afternoon frames on the final day to reduce Davis's lead to 15–13,  well in the first two frames before what the Birmingham Daily Gazette termed a ""woefully weak shot"" when he was attempting to pot the  failed. Directly after this, Davis made a break of 18. Lawrence was 26 points behind after all the  had been potted, and although he potted the first five of the six , left an easy opportunity on the , with Davis potting it to take the frame. Lawrence, who made a 42 break, claimed the following frame for 13–15. Lawrence led 52–14 in the first evening frame but Davis eventually won it 64–56 to retain his title by 16 frames to 13. Davis became the first player to claim both the professional billiards and snooker titles in the same season. The highest break of the final was a 44 by Davis in the 24th frame, the last of the third evening. Two ""dead"" frames were then played, both won by Davis. The presentation of the trophy and a gold medal to Davis, and of cheques to both players, was made by Mr. T. Heyman, chairman of the Midland Amateur Billiards Association.

Davis recorded in his 1976 autobiography that ""my old rival Fred Lawrence ... played extremely well and made me sweat it out,"" adding that ""the finances worked out rather more favourably than in 1927,"" with Davis receiving £32 prize money () and a £25 12s 6d share of the gate receipts ().

Born in Shoreham-by-Sea as Nigel Trubridge, he learned to play the clarinet and saxophone and played with professional jazz bands while still at school. He joined a number of bands, including an early incarnation of Rocky Sharpe and the Replays, before becoming a founder member of the doo wop revival band Darts in 1976, under the name Horatio Hornblower.

Darts had a string of top ten hits, mostly cover versions. Trubridge wrote many of their original numbers, including the number ten hit ""Get It"", which was credited to him under his real name. He also appeared in the musical Yakety Yak, written by the group. Darts disbanded in 1985; Trubridge then played with Hitlist and Lovely Money, both of which saw success on a smaller scale.

Trubridge later worked for the London Borough of Hackney as a Music Development Officer, in which role he set up HAMMA, a music label that released records by local acts. He began working for the Musicians' Union in 1990 as a Music Business Advisor, becoming the union's London officer in 1997 and assistant general secretary in 2003.

In 2017, he was elected as general secretary of the Musicians' Union, defeating Kathy Dyson. He also joined the General Council of the Trades Union Congress.

On 5 February 2020 the union's executive passed a motion extending Trubridge's term without re-election to 15 January 2025, his 68th birthday. A member made a complaint to the Trade Union Certification Officer and a hearing was listed for 18 November. However seven days before the hearing the union rescinded their decision on legal advice from Thompsons Solicitors. The union confirmed that the next election for the role would now go
ahead at the end of Trubridge's current term of office on 27 March 2022.

The trail occupies a  abandoned rail corridor in Ocean County, New Jersey, that

Controversy 
A  segment of the trail right-of-way has been the focus of an ongoing battle to build a bypass road

Early life
Maysey grew up in Chester Township, New Jersey and graduated from West Morris Regional High School (since renamed as West Morris Central High School). Soon after he graduated high school, he enlisted in the U.S. Air Force and 2 years later was sent to Vietnam.

Air Force Cross

Action
On 8 November 1967 two HH-3E Jolly Green Giants of the 37th Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Squadron were launched on a night mission to extract five survivors of a Special Forces reconnaissance team. The site was known to be hot, surrounded by a well-disciplined, People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) battalion. A Vietnamese Air Force (VNAF) and a United States Army helicopter had already been shot down and destroyed.  Illuminated by a C-130 Hercules flare ship dropping LUU-2 parachute flares, Jolly 29 made a pickup of three survivors before being driven off by intense enemy fire. Jolly 29, with heavy battle damage, landed at the USMC Khe Sanh Combat Base. Maysey's helicopter Jolly 26 then attempted to pick up the remaining two survivors, both now wounded.  Fighting, both in the air and on the ground, was intense. Maysey jumped from the safety of Jolly 26, and ran down a steep slope rescuing the two remaining men. Jolly 26 was now being hit with small arms fire.  Just after Maysey had helped both survivors safely on board, a rocket propelled grenade struck the number one engine, fatally crippling the craft. The engine exploded, inverting the aircraft, which rolled and skidded down a deep ravine and burst into flames; a pilot and one other man survived the crash.  Maysey received the Air Force Cross posthumously.  The pilot Captain Gerald Young was rescued later that day and subsequently awarded the Medal of Honor.

Citation

The President of the United States of America, authorized by Title 10, Section 8742, United States Code, takes pride in presenting the Air Force Cross (Posthumously) to Sergeant Larry Wayne Maysey (AFSN: 12751422), United States Air Force, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations against an opposing armed force as an HH-3E Rescue Specialist (Pararescueman) of the 37th Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Squadron, 3d Air Rescue and Recovery Group, DaNang Air Base, Vietnam, in Southeast Asia on 9 November 1967. On that date, Sergeant Maysey attempted the night extraction of a ground reconnaissance team after his helicopter had been severely damaged. Two other helicopters had been shot down and a third extensively damaged in previous attempts. During the rescue attempt, Sergeant Maysey unhesitatingly exposed himself to the hail of hostile fire to assist wounded survivors into the helicopter. The hostile forces closed in quickly, and as the damaged helicopter departed, it was shot down. Though his extraordinary heroism, superb airmanship, and aggressiveness in the face of the enemy, Sergeant Maysey reflected the highest credit upon himself and the United States Air Force.

Commendations
The following awards have been awarded to Sergeant Maysey:

The competition, which started in 1978, was due to the foresight of J.D. Maharaj, who saw it as a way of earning money for cash starved football associations in Fiji. This was the first time that a football competition in Fiji was sponsored by businesses. The competition has been held every year except 1987, when restrictions placed by the military government on organised competitions on Sunday led to all soccer competitions in Fiji being abandoned.

Nature of tournament 
The top 10 district teams take part in the tournament. At present these teams are Ba F.C., Labasa F.C., Lautoka F.C., Nadi F.C., Nadroga, Nasinu, Navua, Rewa, Suva and Tavua. The teams are divided into two pools of five and each team plays all the other teams once, over three days. A win is worth three points, a draw one point and a loss no points. The top two teams in each pool qualify for the semi-finals, with the winner of each pool playing the runner-up of the other pool. The semi-finals and the final are played on the different days.

The piece appears to have been composed by a clergyman and directed at a lay audience, addressed as  in line 212, whom he perhaps believed to have been potentially misguided.

Witnesses
The original manuscript, MS Otho B XI, was largely destroyed in the Cotton fire of 1731 and ""Seasons for Fasting"" was among the losses. The antiquarian Laurence Nowell had made a transcript in 1562, which was recovered by Robin Flower in 1934 and which is now contained in MS Add. 43703 (London, British Library). Moreover, eight lines of the poem were transcribed by Abraham Whelock. Nowell's transcript has the poem on ff. 257-60v, where it breaks off suddenly, and continues on ff. 261r-64v with Old English remedies and leechdoms and on f. 265-67 with a further transcription of the Laws of Æthelstan. When Humfrey Wanley inspected the manuscript in 1705 for his catalogue, the poem had become the last item.

""']","C. K. Meena is a journalist, novelist and newspaper columnist. She is a science graduate who went on to pursue her M.A in English and B.S. in Communication from Bangalore University. She started her career at The City Tab, a Bangalore weekly tabloid, in the 1980s and worked at Deccan Herald from 1986–93, after which she co-founded the Asian College of Journalism in Bangalore.

In 2005, Dronequill published her first novel, Black Lentil Doughnuts, followed by Dreams for the Dying (2008) and Seven Days to Somewhere (2012). She has also co-authored a handbook on adoption. She co-authored the first non academic book on disability titled The Invisible Majority: India's Abled Disabled (2021). She has been writing ""City Lights"", a fortnightly column, for The Hindu Metro Plus since 2002.

Writing style

In her own words, ""Writing is so deliberate, one is working at it all the time, trying to create an effect, so there’s less spontaneity, but at the same time, one is also saying it out aloud in one's head, telling the story to an imaginary audience. I love telling stories, and hearing stories; I am a shameless eavesdropper, and I can be totally poker-faced; I can even hear things said in an undertone.""

Charumathi Supraja reckons after doing an interview with her, ""Meena decimates stereotypes in her writing. She etches out real “characters” in her stories. There’s a swagger to her writing that’s not conceited – just original. You’ll find a chuckle beneath many a line. Lush, leisurely descriptions don’t fit Meena’s writing persona. But don’t expect to drop the book till you’ve followed every twist, sparkle and glint in her neatly laid out story.""

Meena was influenced by T G Vaidyanathan.

Feminism
Meena is a feminist. From one of her interviews, ""Why are women in the centre? Not the man but the woman. For me, women are in the centre, whether I like it or not. It’s possibly linked to the feminist perspective that I have always had. Somehow when I start writing I find that it’s the women who take centre stage, the men are either not very nice guys (laughs) or are incidental.""

Works
Her first novel, Black Lentil Doughnuts was published in 2005. In it, Meena talks about Shanthi and her alter-ego Lilly who escape the oppressive warmth of their small town to taste the freedom of an emerging metropolis. Shanthi is seduced by the anarchism of the Three Mosquitoes, while Lilly's seductions are on more predictable lines. But all the while they are being stalked by an insane mass hysteria that sees them as outsiders C K Meena takes the readers on a roller coaster ride through the love and hate, gentleness and brutality that is metropolitan India.

Members of the ‘Executioners’ are deputies operating out of the Compton station of the LASD. These deputies share a tattoo, which features a skeleton with an assault rifle and a Nazi-style helmet. The gang was founded by former 2000 Boys member Andy Toone.

Tattoo
Members of the Executioners identify themselves with a calf tattoo depicting a skeleton wearing a Nazi-style helmet labeled ""CPT"" and holding a Kalashnikov rifle with '28' in Roman numerals on the magazine. The 'CPT' stands for ""Compton"" and the '28' represents Compton as the LASD's 28th substation.

Membership
Members of the Executioners are drawn from deputies who work at the Compton station of the LASD. Knock LA has reported that the gang consists of around 80 members.

Pocomo History
 
Over forty years ago a group of enthusiasts led by Gordon Eddy and Jack Cole met at the Port Arms Hotel and decided to establish a rugby club outside of the traditional Vancouver area. The idea was to foster the development of the game in the Port Moody, Coquitlam and Port Coquitlam; thus the creation of the Pocomo Rugby Club.

Vic Coulter (1917–2001) was chosen to be the first President and the Club has experienced a relatively health existence ever since its 1963 inception. Although the Club has never had access to significant finances, industrious members have done what was necessary to persevere.

Under the Direction of Coulter the Club continued to grow and set as a goal the dissemination of the gospel of rugby throughout the Fraser Valley. In order to do this the Club contacted all the Secondary Schools form Port Moody to Chilliwack and team members organized clinics in order to get recent graduates interested in club rugby. The Club established the annual Outriders Trophy with Richmond Rugby Club, who at the time was the only other club beyond Vancouver city.

All the hard work proved to be successful and in 1973 Coulter and Pocomo helped organize the Fraser Valley Rugby Union. The Fraser Valley Rugby Union launched with thirteen clubs, which included no less than five from the U.S. A few fledgling clubs such as Port Coquitlam, Pitt River, Maple Ridge and the U.S. sides have come and gone, only to occasionally resurface. Pocomo continued to grow as one of the pillars of the Fraser Valley and by 1983 they would field four senior men's teams. The Club has won numerous league championships as well as various members were given the Vic Coulter Service Award, for their contribution to rugby in the Fraser Valley.

In 1985, Pocomo introduced their first Women's side and defeated S.F.U., who hadn't lost a match in three years. This first Women's program didn't last long and by 1988 the program was temporarily shut down. Sticking with their roots, Pocomo has continued to foster rugby in the high schools of the Tri-Cities for both boys and girls. Club members volunteer in both middle school and high school as coaches, referees and managers. The Club has also donated a trophy and organized an annual tournament for the top senior team in the Tri-Cities. This hard work has continued to prove successful and in 2000 Pocomo restarted a Women's side who earned the 2nd division provincial championship. With this success, the women's side moved up into the 1st division league, in 2005 they added a second women's team and won the 1st division Provincial Cup and the opportunity for promotion into the BC Provincial Premier League.

The Club heralds a strong tradition of players and alumni who are hard, dedicated workers. Club honours began when Bill Christie received the Stroess Trophy in 1966, since then members such as Gordon Eddy, Bill Turpin, Ken Yates and Ian (Onion) Robertson have gone on to win this award. The 2nd division earned the player's first honours winning Dunbar Trophy in 1968.

With the introduction of the Premier league in 1997, Pocomo and several other clubs faced new strains and challenges. Pocomo saw over 20 players retire or defect to Premier clubs, this forced the club to be reduced to two senior men's teams. However, they still fought hard and in 1999, Pocomo returned to the Vancouver Rugby Union where it made it to the 2nd division finals. The continued growth in Premier clubs and premier rugby forced Pocomo to make some difficult decisions and in 1998 Pocomo entered into amalgamation talks with S.F.U. and later Douglas but were unsuccessful at working out the particulars.

Over the next few seasons Pocomo fought hard, but to limited success and in 2005, Pocomo once again was talking with S.F.U. about merging clubs. At the same time a delegation of Douglas members were quietly talking with some of the Pocomo Executive regarding a similar merger. At the end of the season the Pocomo and S.F.U. voted but both were shy of the required majority. Formal talks with Douglas began and a vote was held shortly after. The clubs voted with large positive majority from both sides.

Douglas History
 
The Douglas Rugby Club was established in the spring of 1971 when a group of Douglas College students, organized by Gert Van Niekerk, took part in a 7-a-side tournament hosted by Malaspina College of Nanaimo. That fall, the Douglas College team joined the Pacific Intercollegiate League and finished second with a record of 5-5-1. The team was captained by Howie Martfelt,

In 1972, the team won the Totem Conference Championship, playing against the other community colleges in the province. That year's captain was Dave Jagger. Without suffering one defeat, the team continued as Totem Conference champions for the next two years. By this time, the alumni team had formed and took part in a series of exhibition games against local clubs.

In 1975, the Douglas College Rugby Club entered two teams in the Fraser Valley Rugby Union 2nd Division. In their first year, the A-Side won the championship and was promoted to the 1st Division for the 1976-1977 season. By the fall of 1977, the club had teams in all three divisions of the FVRU and the 1st Division side won both the league and playoff titles. At the end of that season, the club voted to change its name to simply become the Douglas Rugby Club. The college team had ceased to exist, but the club continued to recruit players from the college.

Douglas had enjoyed continued success since its inception, particularly with its 1st Division team. The squad won numerous FVRU league titles and playoff championships in 1981, 1983 and 1992. On more than one occasion, the 2nd and 3rd XV have each been champions. The collegiate team was revived in 1990 and won the Northwest Intercollegiate Rugby Union (NIRU) Championship in 1993.

Douglas first tested the waters in women's rugby in 1974. The team beat Capilano College 36-4 in the Totem Conference Collegiate 7-a-side Tournament. The first serious attempt at women's rugby occurred in the spring of 1977 when a team was formed under the tutelage of Burt Kirby, Mark Andrews and Mark Ovenden. The team was called the Loose Ruckers. They played in the first-ever women's 15-a-side match in the Lower Mainland, on March 6, 1977 against UBC at Jericho Park, losing 8-0.

There was very little competition at this time and, after a couple of years of exhibition games, the team dissolved. Some of the original members included Elanie Benson, Sara Lee Liner, Rita Boon, Barb Kirby, Diana Nygaard, Edie Naylor, and Marge Naylor.

Douglas revived its women's program in the fall of 1991 when a team was entered in the recently formed West Coast Women's Rugby Association (WCWRA). Other teams in the league were Vancouver Rowing Club, Ex-Britannia Lions, and the University of Victoria. Simon Fraser University and the University of British Columbia also had teams playing a series of exhibition matches. During the first year, the Douglas women were probationary club members. They were accepted for full membership by the 1993-1994 season.

The women's program continued to grow stronger, especially with the support of Lou Rene Legge and the Douglas College Athletic Department. In the fall of 1995 the first ever Douglas College Women's Scholarships were awarded to Anne Carnochan and Stephanie Biggar.

With expansion of the WCWRA to twelve teams in 1995, Douglas began the year in 2nd Division. After going undefeated for the first half of that season, the team beat UBC Old Boys 10-8 to gain promotion to the 1st Division. The women enjoyed their most successful season in 1996 with a record of 13-3-1, losing to eventual champions Ex-Britannia Lions in the BC semi-final.

In the fall of 1996, Douglas expanded its women's program to include two teams. The 1st Division squad enjoyed continued success and the 2nd XV won the BC Championship in 1998. The 1st XV, in the re-dubbed Premiere Division, won championships in 2001 and 2002, while the 2nd Division team won a title in 2003 along with the Under-19 Girls.

Perhaps the most successful female player to come out of the Douglas program was Kelly McCallum. Her rugby career began almost by accident. McCallum, still dressed in her soccer gear, showed up early to watch the Douglas men play. Finding only a women's match in progress, she decided to stick around and watch. As the team was short one player, McCallum was asked to fill-in on the wing. Quickly taking to the game, she made her way up the ranks to the National Senior Women's Team. McCallum went on to captain Canada in Edmonton during the 2006 Women's Rugby World Cup, before her retirement.

It is widely recognised as one of his most important works, and as one of the most significant Norwegian literary works of the post-war era. The novel has a complex narrative taken from several different environments from the 1920s Weimar Republic and the Nazi era to the 1950s Norwegian society.

The novel's title character, ""Jonas,"" is a first grader in Norway, who early in the novel encounters a public school system that according to Bjørneboe is increasingly controlled by the ""salamanders,"" a term used metaphorically for the bigoted enemies of culture which Bjørneboe sees in Norway at the time.
 
Jonas is usually interpreted as a harsh critique of the Norwegian public school system and the social democratic society of the 1950s, and has a warm portrayal of an alternative form of education, which is a thinly veiled reference to Waldorf education. At the time, Bjørneboe and his wife Lisel Bjørneboe both worked as Waldorf teachers in Oslo, and the central character ""Johannes Marx"" is inspired by Lisel. The novel however has a much broader focus than the education debate, Bjørneboe's intention was to portray the topic of humanity. To this end, he uses four main biographies, which are all ultimately linked, with a particular emphasis on the character of ""Jonas.""

In this novel, Bjørneboe articulates his often cited idea that Nazism, broadly construed to mean hostility to the idea of humanity, could manifest itself anywhere and any time, for example in Norway in the 1950s.

Bjørneboe, a proponent of the conservative Riksmål language (the traditional language of the educated elite of Norway), uses the radical Samnorsk language as an expression of the lack of culture of the salamanders.

The DOM represents a document with a logical tree. Each branch of the tree ends in a node, and each node contains objects. DOM methods allow programmatic access to the tree; with them one can change the structure, style or content of a document. Nodes can have event handlers attached to them. Once an event is triggered, the event handlers get executed.

The principal standardization of the DOM was handled by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), which last developed a recommendation in 2004. WHATWG took over the development of the standard, publishing it as a living document. The W3C now publishes stable snapshots of the WHATWG standard.

History
The history of the Document Object Model is intertwined with the history of the ""browser wars"" of the late 1990s between Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer, as well as with that of JavaScript and JScript, the first scripting languages to be widely implemented in the JavaScript engines of web browsers.

JavaScript was released by Netscape Communications in 1995 within Netscape Navigator 2.0. Netscape's competitor, Microsoft, released Internet Explorer 3.0 the following year with a reimplementation of JavaScript called JScript. JavaScript and JScript let web developers create web pages with client-side interactivity. The limited facilities for detecting user-generated events and modifying the HTML document in the first generation of these languages eventually became known as ""DOM Level 0"" or ""Legacy DOM."" No independent standard was developed for DOM Level 0, but it was partly described in the specifications for HTML 4.

Legacy DOM was limited in the kinds of elements that could be accessed. Form, link and image elements could be referenced with a hierarchical name that began with the root document object. A hierarchical name could make use of either the names or the sequential index of the traversed elements. For example, a form input element could be accessed as either document.formName.inputName or document.forms[0].elements[0].

The Legacy DOM enabled client-side form validation and simple interface interactivity like creating tooltips.

In 1997, Netscape and Microsoft released version 4.0 of Netscape Navigator and Internet Explorer respectively, adding support for Dynamic HTML (DHTML) functionality enabling changes to a loaded HTML document. DHTML required extensions to the rudimentary document object that was available in the Legacy DOM implementations. Although the Legacy DOM implementations were largely compatible since JScript was based on JavaScript, the DHTML DOM extensions were developed in parallel by each browser maker and remained incompatible. These versions of the DOM became known as the ""Intermediate DOM"".

After the standardization of ECMAScript, the W3C DOM Working Group began drafting a standard DOM specification. The completed specification, known as ""DOM Level 1"", became a W3C Recommendation in late 1998. By 2005, large parts of W3C DOM were well-supported by common ECMAScript-enabled browsers, including Microsoft Internet Explorer version 6 (from 2001), Opera, Safari and Gecko-based browsers (like Mozilla, Firefox, SeaMonkey and Camino).

Standards

The W3C DOM Working Group published its final recommendation and subsequently disbanded in 2004. Development efforts migrated to the WHATWG, which continues to maintain a living standard. In 2009, the Web Applications group reorganized DOM activities at the W3C. In 2013, due to a lack of progress and the impending release of HTML5, the DOM Level 4 specification was reassigned to the HTML Working Group to expedite its completion. Meanwhile, in 2015, the Web Applications group was disbanded and DOM stewardship passed to the Web Platform group. Beginning with the publication of DOM Level 4 in 2015, the W3C creates new recommendations based on snapshots of the WHATWG standard.

 DOM Level 1 provided a complete model for an entire HTML or XML document, including the means to change any portion of the document.
 DOM Level 2 was published in late 2000. It introduced the getElementById function as well as an event model and support for XML namespaces and CSS.
 DOM Level 3, published in April 2004, added support for XPath and keyboard event handling, as well as an interface for serializing documents as XML.
 DOM Level 4 was published in 2015. It is a snapshot of the WHATWG living standard.

Applications

Web browsers
To render a document such as a HTML page, most web browsers use an internal model similar to the DOM. The nodes of every document are organized in a tree structure, called the DOM tree, with the topmost node named as ""Document object"". When an HTML page is rendered in browsers, the browser downloads the HTML into local memory and automatically parses it to display the page on screen. However, the DOM does not necessarily need to be represented as a tree, and some browsers have used other internal models.

JavaScript
When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model of the page, which is an object oriented representation of an HTML document that acts as an interface between JavaScript and the document itself. This allows the creation of dynamic web pages, because within a page JavaScript can:

 add, change, and remove any of the HTML elements and attributes
 change any of the CSS styles
 react to all the existing events
 create new events

Implementations
Because the DOM supports navigation in any direction (e.g., parent and previous sibling) and allows for arbitrary modifications, an implementation must at least buffer the document that has been read so far (or some parsed form of it).

Layout engines

Web browsers rely on layout engines to parse HTML into a DOM. Some layout engines, such as Trident/MSHTML, are associated primarily or exclusively with a particular browser, such as Internet Explorer. Others, including Blink, WebKit, and Gecko, are shared by a number of browsers, such as Google Chrome, Opera, Safari, and Firefox. The different layout engines implement the DOM standards to varying degrees of compliance.

She was classically trained at Brigham Young University–Idaho, and started composing in 2003, later releasing her debut album in 2007.

Thomas has issued six albums, the latest, The Fire Within, was released in October 2018, and debuted at number 3 in the Billboard Classical music charts, number 2 in their Classical Crossover music charts, and number 25 in the Top Heatseekers.

Several of her original compositions and Classical music arrangements have been used in routines by International Skating Union Ice skaters and Olympic games gymnasts.

Thomas's YouTube video recordings have achieved a total of over 10 million views, with over 1.7 million viewing a live concert performance of her arrangement of ""Carol of the Bells"" from her Winter Symphony (Jennifer Thomas album). This performance was on December 2015 at Benaroya Hall in Seattle, with the Ensign Symphony & Chorus.

Early life
Thomas was born in Seattle, Washington. She got her first toy piano at the age of 3, and began formal lessons on both the piano and violin at the age of 5, under the tutelage of her mother, Carolyn Southworth. Her brothers also learned piano, violin, and cello from their mother. Jennifer and her older brother played in grade school orchestras, with Southworth as a conductor's assistant. Thomas continued to train classically, and was involved in many recitals and piano adjudications through her teen years. She played with various youth orchestras and high school orchestras. She performed at her high school graduation, and later went to Brigham Young University - Idaho.

At Brigham Young University–Idaho, Thomas studied piano under Professor Stephen Allen. She was a member of the university's Piano Ensemble group, accompanied the College choir and many vocal/instrumental students, as well as played violin in the university symphony. Thomas also competed in the University's Concerto Competition, where she took 2nd place performing the Piano Concerto No. 3 (Prokofiev).

After college graduation, Thomas moved to Salt Lake City, Utah, and was a regular performer with the Temple Square Concert Series, and played violin in the Murray Symphony orchestra. While performing with the Murray Symphony, Thomas was a featured soloist on the Edward MacDowell Piano Concerto No. 2.  She eventually moved to Northwest, where she performed as a violinist with the Oregon Pro Arte Chamber Orchestra, and worked for the Seattle Symphony in the Education Department. It was during her time working for the Seattle Symphony when she started composing her own original music.

Career
Thomas is known for writing and performing piano-centered orchestral music from classical music to crossover music and cinematic orchestral epic music. While most of her works are original, she also covers classical pieces as well as pop music and movie soundtracks. Thomas has also composed film scores, where she won the Gold Medal of Excellence in the 2011 Park City Film Music Festival for ""Music in a Short Film"" as well as a 2012 Hollywood Music in Media Award for ""Best Film Score for Documentary/Short"".

Thomas' third album, Illumination, won ""Album of the Year"" and ""Artist of the Year"" at the 2013 IMC Awards. In October 2015 Illumination also won the ""Classical Song of the Year"" International Music and Entertainment Association Award, and the Enlightened Piano Radio Award for ""Best piano album with instrumentation"" at Carnegie Hall New York City – where she performed live at the awards ceremony.

Winter Symphony, Thomas' fourth album was released in November 2015. Mixed by five time Grammy Award winner Brian Vibberts, contributors included Glen Gabriel, Ricky Kej and Taylor Davis (violinist).  Following the album release, Thomas performed concerts at Salt Lake City, Atascocita, Texas and the Benaroya Hall Seattle. The album has received many favorable reviews and during 2016 won several prestigious awards.

In March 2017 Thomas arranged an orchestral cover of the Beauty and the Beast (Disney song) featuring cellist Armen Ksajikian to coincide with the release of the Walt Disney Pictures and Mandeville Films movie Beauty and the Beast (2017 film). During July 2017 Thomas collaborated with poet J.ournal to produce a double award-winning track and video Nine Twelve, a powerful 9/11 reminder message, October 2017 saw a 10-year special re-mastered edition of her 2007 album Key of Sea.

On 12 October 2018 Thomas widely released a Billboard charting classical/cinematic music styled album titled The Fire Within which she previewed live in concert at Benaroya Hall in Seattle. During the winter of 2018 a composition by Thomas, A Beautiful Storm, was used in ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating gold medal programmes by Rika Kihira from Japan. Following this a partnership was established with Avex Entertainment to promote her album Key of Sea in Japan

Commencing June 19, 2019, Thomas embarked on a well received summer concert tour of the western United States.
During 2019 more ice skating recognition of her music continued when her composition “Illumination” was performed in a free skate program by American Alysa Liu to win the ISU Junior Grand Prix in the United States. Liu retained the title in 2020 skating to the same composition. 2020 also saw Cha Jun-hwan win the South Korean figure skating championships performing to the Thomas and Kimberly StarKey composition The Fire Within.

In March 2021 Thomas's music was performed in the 2021 World Figure Skating Championships by Rika Kihira, Cha Jun-hwan and Alexandra Feigin and in April by Rika Kihira for the ISU World Team Trophy in Figure Skating.

The 2020 Summer Olympics, held in Tokyo, Japan July 2021, saw her original composition Winter Symphony performed by Russian Olympic Committee gold medallist gymnast Vladislava Urazova and her arrangement of Tchaikovsky's Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy used in a routine by 21st placed finalist gymnast Lee Yun-seo from South Korea. At the 2022 Winter Olympics held in Beijing China, Karen Chen representing Team USA ( who won the silver medal) skated to a Jennifer Thomas, Escala (group) and Hugo Choinard mix of ""Requiem for a Tower"" and ""Requiem for a Dream"", composed by Clint Mansell.

Personal life
Thomas is married to Will Thomas, an ultra-marathon competitor who, in 2015, competed in the 106 mile race Ultra-Trail du Mont-Blanc in France. Together, they have three children and reside in the Seattle, Washington area.

99,"['In a ten - yeared period the number of students in the county decline by 42,000 .', 'Around 2007 Sixin Village schooled have over 100 students , and its smallest class have 9 students .']","Yunyang County () is a county in the northeast of Chongqing Municipality, China, bordering Hubei province to the south.

In eastern Chongqing is Yunyang County with over 1,400 years of history and a reputation as the 'Bright Pearl of Chongqing'. The county abounds with natural resources, beautiful landscapes and historical relics. The culture of Ba (the ancient name of Chongqing), salt culture and the culture of the Migrants from Three Gorges area can be learned in this area.
The scenery here is rich. Mountain, river, valley, cave and ancient architecture can be seen here. Zhang Fei Temple, which is regarded as a wonderful historic relic of the Yangtze River area is a must. It was built in memory of Zhang Fei, a general of the Three Kingdoms Period (220 - 280). The temple, with over 1,700 years' of history is visited by numerous tourists from home and abroad every year. It has been a hotspot for Yangtze River Cruises.

Because of the Three Gorges Dam Project, territories of Yunyang County have been submerged. The whole county and its local people have moved to the new county of Yunyang. Located at Shuangjiang Town on the northern bank of the Yangtze River, the new county is 162 miles from the Three Gorges Dam and 223 miles from Chongqing City. It is the county that has moved the longest distance among the migrating counties and cities during the Three Gorges Project.

Together with the people, Zhang Fei Temple, which is the hot scenic spot here has also been moved to Panshi Town which is opposite the New Town of Yunyang.

After years of construction, Yunyang has developed quickly and now has over 150 thousand local residences. The museum presenting the culture of the Migrants from the Three Gorges area has been built. Now, it has become a city with a good environment, well-developed communication and rich tourism resources.

History
In 314 BC, Juren County (朐忍县) was established in Qin state. In 568 AD, the county seat was moved to the site of modern Yunyang Town, and the county was renamed Yun'an (云安县). In 1283, the county was replaced by Yunyang Prefecture (云阳州). In 1373, the prefecture was downgraded to a county. In 1999, the county seat was moved from the now-submerged Yunyang Town to Shuangjiang Town (双江镇).

Industrial Zone
Hong Shan Chuan Industry Ltd.

Transportation
Yunyang has one Yangtze River crossing, the Yunyang Yangtze River Bridge.

Education
As of 2015 the county has 138 schools. In 2005 there were 482 schools. In a ten-year period the number of students in the county declined by 42,000.

As of 2015 there are seven schools in Jianquan Township (). Sixin Village School and one other school both have one student each; the teacher at Sixin Village () School that year was Xiang Guozheng (). Around 2007 Sixin Village school had over 100 students, and its smallest class had 9 students.

Students are required to attend larger schools beginning in grade 5.

Ice and dust grains form the primary material out of which the Solar System was formed. Grains of ice are found in the dense regions of molecular clouds, where new stars are formed. Temperatures in these regions can be as low as , allowing molecules that collide with grains to form an icy mantle. Thereafter, atoms undergo thermal motion across the surface, eventually forming bonds with other atoms. This results in the formation of water and methanol. Indeed, the ices are dominated by water and methanol, as well as ammonia, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. Frozen formaldehyde and molecular hydrogen may also be present. Found in lower abundances are nitriles, ketones, esters and carbonyl sulfide. The mantles of interstellar ice grains are generally amorphous, only becoming crystalline in the presence of a star.

The composition of interstellar ice can be determined through its infrared spectrum. As starlight passes through a molecular cloud containing ice, molecules in the cloud absorb energy. This adsorption occurs at the characteristic frequencies of vibration of the gas and dust. Ice features in the cloud are relatively prominently in this spectra, and the composition of the ice can be determined by comparison with samples of ice materials on Earth. In the sites directly observable from Earth, around 60–70% of the interstellar ice consists of water, which displays a strong emission at 3.05 μm from stretching of the O–H bond.

In September 2012, NASA scientists reported that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), subjected to interstellar medium (ISM) conditions, are transformed, through hydrogenation, oxygenation and hydroxylation, to more complex organics - ""a step along the path toward amino acids and nucleotides, the raw materials of proteins and DNA, respectively"". Further, as a result of these transformations, the PAHs lose their spectroscopic signature which could be one of the reasons ""for the lack of PAH detection in interstellar ice grains, particularly the outer regions of cold, dense clouds or the upper molecular layers of protoplanetary disks.""

Older than the Sun
Research published in the journal Science estimates that about 30–50% of the water in the Solar System, like the water on Earth, the discs around Saturn, and the meteorites of other planets was already around even before the birth of the Sun.

Comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko  
On 18 November 2014, spacecraft Philae revealed presence of large amount of water ice on the comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko, the report stating that ""the strength of the ice found under a layer of dust on the first landing site is surprisingly high"". The team responsible for the MUPUS (Multi-Purpose Sensors for Surface and Sub-Surface Science) instrument, which hammered a probe into the comet, estimated that the comet is hard as ice. ""Although the power of the hammer was gradually increased, we were not able to go deep into the surface,"" explained Tilman Spohn from the DLR Institute for Planetary Research, who led the research team.

It has been attributed to the noted New York architect Richard Upjohn.  It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975 for having local significance in the theme of architecture.  It was nominated as a superlative example of Carpenter Gothic design from the mid-19th century.

Description
As originally constructed in 1871, Trinity Episcopal Church consisted of the nave and chancel, plus a transept and vestry on the north.  Immediately to the east was a freestanding church hall used for the parish school.  Both buildings were constructed at the same time, along with a rectory a block and a half to the west.  The gap between the church and hall was later filled in, creating a single  structure.  The three-story bell tower and south transept are also later additions.

The building's board and batten walls were a signature of Episcopal churches from the 1850s to the 1870s.  On the Trinity Episcopal Church, though, the exterior walls are highly embellished with wainscoting below a horizontal band at the height of the window sills.  Directly below each window is a decorative panel of crossed boards.  These elements are not found on the parish hall, indicating it was not designed by the same architect.  The church's lancet windows and door and side-entry bell tower are typical of Carpenter Gothic architecture.

The church's original pine furnishings were replaced in the 1950s.  However very similar furnishings can be seen in the contemporaneous St. Mark's Episcopal Chapel near Annandale, Minnesota.

Architect
Historical documents do not record who the architect was for the church building.  It is believed to have been designed by prominent architect Richard Upjohn of New York City, famous for his Gothic Revival churches.  Upjohn had a plausible connection to the project, given that the construction funds were largely donated by Upjohn's famous Trinity Church in Manhattan and he had designed the Brooklyn home of the family after whom Litchfield was named.  The building's grace and sophistication indicate that Trinity Episcopal Church was indeed one of Upjohn's last works.  Additionally, the original rectory resembles the architect's own home in Garrison, New York, though perhaps coincidentally.

Current use
Trinity Episcopal Church is still an active parish in the Episcopal Diocese of Minnesota.  As of 2021, the parish is served by several diocesan priests and a local priest-in-charge. The original rectory a short distance away has since become a private residence.

Foreland basins form because the immense mass created by crustal thickening associated with the evolution of a mountain belt causes the lithosphere to bend, by a process known as lithospheric flexure. The width and depth of the foreland basin is determined by the flexural rigidity of the underlying lithosphere, and the characteristics of the mountain belt. The foreland basin receives sediment that is eroded off the adjacent mountain belt, filling with thick sedimentary successions that thin away from the mountain belt.  Foreland basins represent an endmember basin type, the other being rift basins.  Space for sediments (accommodation space) is provided by loading and downflexure to form foreland basins, in contrast to rift basins, where accommodation space is generated by lithospheric extension.

Types of foreland basin

Foreland basins can be divided into two categories: 

 Peripheral (Pro) foreland basins, which occur on the plate that is subducted or underthrust during plate collision (i.e. the outer arc of the orogen)
 Examples include the North Alpine Foreland Basin of Europe, or the Ganges Basin of Asia
 Retroarc (Retro) foreland basins, which occur on the plate that overrides during plate convergence or collision (i.e. situated behind the magmatic arc that is linked with the subduction of oceanic lithosphere)
 Examples include the Andean basins, or Late Mesozoic to Cenozoic Rocky Mountain Basins of North America

Foreland basin system

DeCelles & Giles (1996) provide a thorough definition of the foreland basin system. Foreland basin systems comprise three characteristic properties:

 An elongate region of potential sediment accommodation that forms on continental crust between a contractional orogenic belt and the adjacent craton, mainly in response to geodynamic processes related to subduction and the resulting peripheral or retroarc fold-thrust belt;
 It consists of four discrete depozones, referred to as the wedge-top, foredeep, forebulge and back-bulge depozones (depositional zones) – which of these depozones a sediment particle occupies depends on its location at the time of deposition, rather than its ultimate geometric relationship with the thrust belt;
 The longitudinal dimension of the foreland basin system is roughly equal to the length of the fold-thrust belt, and does not include sediment that spills into remnant ocean basins or continental rifts (impactogens).

Foreland basin systems: depozones
The wedge-top sits on top of the moving thrust sheets and contains all the sediments charging from the active tectonic thrust wedge. This is where piggyback basins form.

The foredeep is the thickest sedimentary zone and thickens toward the orogen. Sediments are deposited via distal fluvial, lacustrine, deltaic, and marine depositional systems.

The forebulge and backbulge are the thinnest and most distal zones and are not always present. When present, they are defined by regional unconformities as well as aeolian and shallow-marine deposits.

Sedimentation is most rapid near the moving thrust sheet. Sediment transport within the foredeep is generally parallel to the strike of the thrust fault and basin axis.

Plate motion and seismicity
The motion of the adjacent plates of the foreland basin can be determined by studying the active deformation zone with which it is connected.  Today GPS measurements provide the rate at which one plate is moving relative to another.  It is also important to consider that present day kinematics are unlikely to be the same as when deformation began.  Thus, it is crucial to consider non-GPS models to determine the long-term evolution of continental collisions and in how it helped develop the adjacent foreland basins.

Comparing both modern GPS (Sella et al. 2002) and non-GPS models allows deformation rates to be calculated.  Comparing these numbers to the geologic regime helps constrain the number of probable models as well as which model is more geologically accurate within a specific region.

Seismicity determines where active zones of seismic activity occur as well as measure the total fault displacements and the timing of the onset of deformation.

Formation of basins

Foreland basins form because as the mountain belt grows, it exerts a significant mass on the Earth's crust, which causes it to bend, or flex, downwards.  This occurs so that the weight of the mountain belt can be compensated by isostasy at the upflex of the forebulge.

The plate tectonic evolution of a peripheral foreland basin involves three general stages. First, the passive margin stage with orogenic loading of previously stretched continental margin during the early stages of convergence. Second, the ""early convergence stage defined by deep water conditions"", and lastly a ""later convergent stage during which a subaerial wedge is flanked with terrestrial or shallow marine foreland basins"".

The temperature underneath the orogen is much higher and weakens the lithosphere.  Thus, the thrust belt is mobile and the foreland basin system becomes deformed over time.  Syntectonic unconformities demonstrate simultaneous subsidence and tectonic activity.

Foreland basins are filled with sediments which erode from the adjacent mountain belt. In the early stages, the foreland basin is said to be underfilled. During this stage, deep water and commonly marine sediments, known as flysch, are deposited. Eventually, the basin becomes completely filled. At this point, the basin enters the overfilled stage and deposition of terrestrial clastic sediments occurs. These are known as molasse.  Sediment fill within the foredeep acts as an additional load on the continental lithosphere.

Lithospheric behavior

Although the degree to which the lithosphere relaxes over time is still controversial, most workers accept an elastic or visco-elastic rheology to describe the lithospheric deformation of the foreland basin.  Allen & Allen (2005) describe a moving load system, one in which the deflection moves as a wave through the foreland plate before the load system.  The deflection shape is commonly described as an asymmetrical low close to the load along the foreland and a broader uplifted deflection along the forebulge.  The transport rate or flux of erosion, as well as sedimentation, is a function of topographic relief.

For the loading model, the lithosphere is initially stiff, with the basin broad and shallow.  Relaxation of the lithosphere allows subsidence near the thrust, narrowing of basin, forebulge toward thrust.  During times of thrusting, the lithosphere is stiff and the forebulge broadens.  The timing of the thrust deformation is opposite that of the relaxing of the lithosphere.  The bending of the lithosphere under the orogenic load controls the drainage pattern of the foreland basin.  The flexural tilting of the basin and the sediment supply from the orogen.

Lithospheric strength envelopes
Strength envelopes indicate that the rheological structure of the lithosphere underneath the foreland and the orogen are very different.  The foreland basin typically shows a thermal and rheological structure similar to a rifted continental margin with three brittle layers above three ductile layers.  The temperature underneath the orogen is much higher and thus greatly weakens the lithosphere.  According to Zhou et al. (2003), ""under compressional stress the lithosphere beneath the mountain range becomes ductile almost entirely, except a thin (about 6 km in the center) brittle layer near the surface and perhaps a thin brittle layer in the uppermost mantle.""  This lithospheric weakening underneath the orogenic belt may in part cause the regional lithospheric flexure behavior.

Thermal history
Foreland basins are considered to be hypothermal basins (cooler than normal), with low geothermal gradient and heat flow. Heat flow values average between 1 and 2 HFU (40–90 mWm−2.  Rapid subsidence may be responsible for these low values.

Over time sedimentary layers become buried and lose porosity.  This can be due to sediment compaction or the physical or chemical changes, such as pressure or cementation.  Thermal maturation of sediments is a factor of temperature and time and occurs at shallower depths due to past heat redistribution of migrating brines.

Vitrinite reflectance, which typically demonstrates an exponential evolution of organic matter as a function of time, is the best organic indicator for thermal maturation.  Studies have shown that present day thermal measurements of heat flow and geothermal gradients closely correspond to a regime's tectonic origin and development as well as the lithospheric mechanics.

Fluid migration
Migrating fluids originate from the sediments of the foreland basin and migrate in response to deformation.  As a result, brine can migrate over great distances.  Evidence of long-range migration includes: 1) Correlation of petroleum to distant source rocks 2) Ore bodies deposited from metal-bearing brines, 3) Anomalous thermal histories for shallow sediments, 4) Regional potassium metasomatism, 5) Epigenetic dolomite cements in ore bodies and deep aquifers.

Fluid source
Fluids carrying heat, minerals, and petroleum, have a vast impact on the tectonic regime within the foreland basin.  Before deformation, sediment layers are porous and full of fluids, such as water and hydrated minerals.  Once these sediments are buried and compacted, the pores become smaller and some of the fluids, about , leave the pores.  This fluid has to go somewhere.  Within the foreland basin, these fluids potentially can heat and mineralize materials, as well as mix with the local hydrostatic head.

Major driving force for fluid migration
Orogen topography is the major driving force of fluid migration.  The heat from the lower crust moves via conduction and groundwater advection.  Local hydrothermal areas occur when deep fluid flow moves very quickly.  This can also explain very high temperatures at shallow depths.

Other minor constraints include tectonic compression, thrusting, and sediment compaction.  These are considered minor because they are limited by the slow rates of tectonic deformation, lithology and depositional rates, on the order of 0–10 cm yr−1, but more likely closer to 1 or less than 1 cm yr−1.  Overpressured zones might allow for faster migration, when 1 kilometer or more of shaly sediments accumulate per 1 million years.

Bethke & Marshak (1990) state that ""groundwater that recharges at high elevation migrates through the subsurface in response to its high potential energy toward areas where the water table is lower.""

Hydrocarbon migration
Bethke & Marshak (1990) explain that petroleum migrates not only in response to the hydrodynamic forces that drive groundwater flow, but to the buoyancy and capillary effects of the petroleum moving through microscopic pores.  Migration patterns flow away from the orogenic belt and into the cratonic interior.  Frequently, natural gas is found closer to the orogen and oil is found further away.

 Formed during the Palaeocene to Neogene (65.5-2.6 Ma) convergence and collision between Eurasia and the Adriatic Plate
 Complications arise in the formation of the Rhine Graben

 Po Basin, northern Italy.
 Retro-foreland basin of the Western and Central Southern Alps and pro-foreland of the Northern Apennines. It developed through extensional phases followed by compressional stages. Its compressional architecture is overprinted on the inherited extensional framework.
 The compressional architecture ""developed intermittently at the front of two different mountain chains, the Northern Apennines and the Southern Alps, progressively converging one towards the other.""
 There were two extensional cycles: a) Eastward pre-rift extension cycles culminating in the Anisian to Carnian (middle to early late Triassic, 247-227 Ma) cycle formation of the carbonate platform and basin system; b) Late Triassic–Liassic syn-rift extension phases related to the Piedmont-Liguria and Ionian oceanic basin spreading. After this the maximum basin widening and deepening was reached with progressive formation of the Lombardian, Belluno, and Adriatic carbonate basins.

 Veneto-Friuli foreland basin, an alluvial plain in north-eastern Italy. 
 Developed as the result of superposition of three overlapping foreland systems which differed in age and tectonic movement direction as this plain is the foreland of three surrounding chains. These are: a) the External Dinarides to the East, with Late Palaeocene to the Middle Eocene WSW vergent main deformation phases; b) the Eastern Southern Alps to the north, with mostly Middle-Late Miocene (17-7 Ma) deformation and south-directed tectonic movement; c) the Northern Apennines to the southwest, with Plio-Pleistocene (5 Ma-Recent) NE-directed deformation.
 It is separated from the Central Western Alps and its foreland (the Po foreland basin) by the Lessini and Berici Mountains and Euganei Hills structural high, a relatively undeformed foreland block.
 Flexure began in the Late Cretaceous with an E-ward faint bending due to the build-up of the External Dinaric thrust belt. There followed two main depositional/flexure cycles: a) the Chattian-Langhian cycle (Late Oligocene-Middle Eocene, 28-14 Ma) with a weak northward bending that accommodated sediments mainly from the uplifted and eroded axial sector of the Alps; b) the Serravallian-Early Messinian cycle (Middle to Late Miocene) with a NNW-ward prominent bending due to quick uplift of the Southern Alps. In the Pliocene-Pleistocene only the south-western-most part (southern part of the Veneto Basin) bent towards SW as result of the Northern Apennines build-up.

 Central and Southern Adriatic basins
 Located between Italy and the Balkan Peninsula. It includes the Adriatic Sea Istria, the Gargano Promontory and the Apulian Peninsula.
 Formed by two orogenies, the Dinarides orogeny (Latest Cretaceous, 75-66 Ma to Eocene, 56-34 Ma) and Appennine orogeny (Miocene to Pliocene (23-2.6 Ma). It is connected to the Po Basin.

 Foreland basins of the Carpathian Mountains
 Carpathian Foredeep
 Continuation of North Alpine Molasse Basin to the Western Carpathians, located in southern Poland and western Ukraine.
 East Carpathian Foreland Basin
 The foreland basin of the Eastern Carpathians which extends through southern Poland, western Ukraine, Moldova and Romania and is 800 km long. In the late Miocene to early Pliocene it was an important sediment supplier to the Dacian Basin and the Black Sea.
 Dacian Basin
 This is a foreland basin by the Romanian section of the Eastern Carpathians and the Southern Carpathians (also in Romania). It is a post-collisional basin which developed in the Messinian to Pliocene (7-2.6 Ma). Initially the sedimentation from this basin was mostly just in a pre-existent foredeep area. Subsequently it extended southward over the northern part of the Moesian Platform and a part of the Scythian platform.

 Ebro Basin
 Peripheral foreland basin to the south of the Pyrenees, in northern Spain
 Substantial deformation of the foreland basin has occurred in the north, exemplified by the foreland fold and thrust belt in the western Catalan province. The basin is well known for the spectacular exposures of syn- and post-tectonic sediment strata due to the peculiar drainage evolution of the basin.

It is part of the Upper East Side Historic District, designated by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1981.

History 
In 1900, Marshall Orme Wilson hired the architectural firm of Warren and Wetmore to design a private residence for his himself and his wife, Carrie Astor Wilson, the youngest daughter of William Backhouse Astor Jr. and Caroline Webster Schermerhorn Astor, ""The Mrs. Astor of the 400"".  Construction of the Wilson house was completed in 1903.

The house was in close proximity to the other Astor family residences, including the twin home of Carrie's mother Mrs. Astor and Carrie's brother, John Jacob Astor IV (and his wife, the former Ava Lowle Willing), which was around the corner on the northeast corner of Fifth and 65th (at 841 and 840 Fifth Avenue) in a mansion designed by Richard Morris Hunt.  The Wilson's son, Orme Wilson Jr., lived down the street at 11 East 64th Street.

Carrie died on September 13, 1948, at the age of 87.  Three months later, on December 12, the New York Times reported that ""The big town house of the late Mrs. Orme Wilson at 3 East 64th Street has been purchased by the Government of India as headquarters for its diplomatic representatives in New York.""  After it was bought by the Government of India, it came to be known as New India House and, in 1952, interior alterations occurred, designed by William Lescaze. The building is currently the seat of the Consulate General of India.

Architecture 
The Beaux-Arts street facade is constructed of Indiana Limestone with a mansard roof of blue slate. The design is in the manner of Percier and Fontaine, who revived the French Renaissance style of Hardouin Mansart. The structure is five stories tall, sixty-five feet wide consisting of five bays. One of the most engaging features of the house is the circular atrium. Rustication, carving and a balcony emphasize the central segmental-arch entrance.

The first floor has square-headed windows with splayed keystones; cornice between first and second floors; stone balcony on monumental brackets in front of central window of second floor; round-arched second floor windows set within concave round-arched recesses with unusual foliate keystones; square-headed windows of third floor have keystones with smooth enframement and stylized sill corbels; stone band at impost level; modillioned roof cornice with handsome balustrades; two-story slate mansard roof pierced by segmental dormers above which are bulls-eye dormers.

Outline
It is stated to be the onryō of humans turned into balls of fire, and it is said to be possible to beckon for it by beating a zōri three times, or putting saliva on the zōri and calling for it. It is also said that the face of a human floats in the fire.

They are also said to appear above water, and from this they are sometimes called a type of funayūrei. In the Nara Prefecture, they are sometimes seen to be the same as the kaika janjanbi.

According to the folklore researcher Rinichihara Ichihara's book, they are largely split into two different kinds, the ones that come forth from the flesh the instant a human dies, and those that come from humans while they sleep.

As an example of the latter, there was a folktale as follows from the Kami Distrinct, Kōchi Prefecture (now Kami) from the early Meiji period. When a man called Yoshiyan was walking through the road at night, beside the Monobe River, there was a kechibi turned over on the roadside. Upon coming closer to it, it would start rolling around, and when he chased it due to curiosity, the kechibi would also run away, and eventually he found himself entering a person's home. In that home, a man who was having a nightmare woke up, and said to his wife, ""Yoshiyan was chasing me, so I ran away desperately.""

Also, as a folktale in the Takaoka District also from the Meiji Period, a man with much bravery named Kumaani Saitō witnessed a kechibi, and when he shouted, ""come fly over here,"" it flew right in front of him. Saitō attempted to catch the fire alive, but each time he tried to catch it in his hand or tread on it with his feet the kechibi would disappear, and then reappear over and over. He finally captured it in both hands and took it back to his home, but at his home, when he opened his hand, the kechibi had already disappeared before he knew it. The next day, Kumaani had a fever of unknown cause, and died just like that.

In the Tosa Obake Zōshi (author unknown), a Yōkai Emaki from the Tosa Province (now Kōchi Prefecture) in the Edo period, it was written as 鬼火 and had furigana indicating a reading of ""kechibi"".

Baptiste is a fictional, comic book superheroine in the series Witchblade, published by Top Cow. The character was introduced in the one-hundredth issue, becoming the series' co-lead. An athletic young dancer, Dani becomes the new host of the Witchblade, a mystical gauntlet that grants its host an assortment of powers. The series' story arc then shows the character losing the gauntlet to its original host, but later taking hold of the Angelus, one of the two primal forces of the universe.

Fictional character biography
Dani, an impulsive but good-hearted young woman, was born in New Orleans. She moved to New York to pursue a dance career and fulfill her childhood dream. However, following graduation, she became increasingly frustrated about the lack of direction in her life.

Following a strange dream about a mystical gauntlet, Dani was drawn to an antiques shop owned by the mysterious Curator, who later became a trusted confidant of Dani's. At the antiques shop, Dani encountered Sara Pezzini, who at the time of meeting was the host of the Witchblade (Dani and Pezzini previously encountered each other on the steps of the police department where Sara worked). Dani instantly recognized the Witchblade as the mysterious entity in her dreams and impulsively decided to accept it from Sara, who was focused upon motherhood rather than the adventures that accompany the gauntlet. Sara was initially hesitant about handing the Witchblade over to Dani but changed her mind when she noticed how the gauntlet reacted strongly to Dani's presence.

Dani eventually learned that the Witchblade was actually the balance between two primal forces of the universe — a female entity of light known as the Angelus and a male entity of darkness known as the Darkness. She was drawn back home after her father was taken into a hospital. While Dani was enjoying an evening out in New Orleans, she was harassed by three young men and punished them by drawing them into a dark alley and unleashing the Witchblade, almost choking one of them to death. It was then she realized that the Witchblade had a mind of its own and that she would have to exert more control over it.

Dani was then confronted by a mysterious woman who urged her to go to a nearby graveyard, where she was confronted by rotting and deformed ghosts. They begged Dani to help set them free and explained that the ancient and mystical Madeline Desormeaux, who lived in a large mansion on the edge of the graveyard, had tortured them in life and had bound them to the land in death. Dani agreed and promised to bring Madeline to them for justice.

Dani went into the house, and after a brief fight, emerged triumphant. The ghosts then had their revenge on Desormeaux, and were able to move on. The graveyard and the house then disappeared.

Dani is left feeling increasingly unsure whether or not she can control the Witchblade. She returned to her father's bedside and was delighted to find him conscious. She promised to stay by his side for a few weeks to help his recovery and then return to New York, resolving to get rid of the Witchblade after her ghostly encounter. However, she would later end up changing her mind.

Dani later discovered more about her powers (including the ability of flight) while helping the Magdalena and Jackie Estacado, the host of the Darkness, defend a pregnant Sara. After Sara's life was threatened by giving birth, Danielle returned half of the Witchblade in order to save her.

Later, Madame Kostigian, Dani's dance teacher, asked her to take over introductory classes while she returned to Poland to be with her sister, who had cancer. In the first class she taught, Dani met a girl named Finch. While teaching another class with Finch, Dani sensed something wrong and decided to ask Finch why she was so sad lately. Over coffee Finch revealed that her boyfriend, Rock, was trying to turn her into a prostitute. When Dani stated that she may be able to help, Finch excitedly kissed her, surprising Dani. However, Finch immediately apologized and left. While accompanied by Finch, Dani had a brief skirmish with Rock at his apartment, using the Witchblade to frighten him. During this encounter, Rock was accidentally shot and killed by a friend of his who quickly departed. A shaken Dani then went to Sara for help, and the two moved the body into the street, making it look like a suicide. An angry Sara then lashed out verbally, and she and Dani parted ways.

The Curator then informed Dani that when the Witchblade was divided, so, too, were its essences. While Dani's half represented the Angelus, Sara's half represented the Darkness. Without balance, the chaotic nature of Sara's half was slowly corrupting her. Dani then considered giving the Angelus half of the Witchblade to Sara, but was told that doing so would not remove the Darkness's influence from Sara's body, as its effects had already become too great. As such, Dani resolved to recover the second half of the entity. She set out to confront Sara in a final battle but was defeated and lost her half of the Witchblade. However, the Angelus, having possessed Finch, arrived and saved Dani by possessing her. Unlike the previous hosts, Dani retained her personality and was able to stop the Angelus from killing Sara, using her newfound powers of Light to free her friend from the taint of the Darkness. She leaves New York after parting with Sara on good terms, and heads back to New Orleans with Finch.

Dani then returned home to New Orleans and moved into an apartment with Finch. After leaving the apartment, she and Finch were attacked by a multi-headed chimera. Dani was forced to call upon the Angelus but was nearly defeated, only to be saved by Sabine, one of the Angelus' followers. Sabine then took Dani with her to the Angelus' home realm.

As the Angelus had not fully taken Dani over, she only retains a vague memory of the Angelus' realm after she was guided by Sabine to the throne room where a copy of the Darkness, pierced by Angelus' spear, was kept. Sabine then talked Dani into planning an attack on Jackie Estacado. However, she rejected the plan, saying that Jackie was a friend. At the last minute she remembered that Finch was left on Earth and returned just in time to save her from two men attempting to rape her.

After the recreation of the universe, Dani is now a police detective in the Special Cases division and serves as Patrick Gleason's partner. However, she was never the host of the Angelus in this universe as the Angelus' essence was spread amongst her warriors like a hive mind before taking Finch as a new host.

Powers and abilities

The Witchblade
Dani is a professional ballet dancer; as such, she is very agile and dexterous. Dani was the former host of the Witchblade, during which time she possessed all the powers associated with it.

The Angelus
Dani once wielded the powers of the Angelus, a universal force of order and creation, the equal and opposite of the Darkness. She possessed superhuman strength, speed and durability. She was able to craft beam-like weapons of light, project light-beams, burn objects and people with her touch, and create a semi-organic armor about herself which increased her durability to near-invulnerability. She could also grow wings from the armor giving her self-propelled flight. Additionally, she could manipulate all aspects of order in existence, possessed healing abilities, immortality, teleportation, night-vision, fire manipulation (an extension of her light manipulation ability) and most importantly, the ability to create objects and sentient beings of pure light and fashion them into shapes and functions that she found pleasing. Her powers were limited, however, since functioning in the dark quickly drained her powers and turned anything she created into dust. The source of her light power was the light energy that half the universe is composed of, the same energy also radiated from her body when she used her powers, while her physical abilities were granted to her by her status as an Angelus host.

He was active helping his parishioners during the bombing of his church in northern Sri Lanka. He went missing with Wenceslaus Vinces Vimalathas on August 20, 2006 and is presumed dead.

Background

Allaipiddy village falls within the government-controlled territory in northern Sri Lanka. It is a prominent minority Sri Lankan Tamil but Roman Catholic dominant village in the Jaffna peninsula. The Sri Lankan Navy has security jurisdiction in the surrounding area.

Thiruchchelvam Nihal Jim Brown was ordained in 2004. In July 2006, he was appointed parish priest of St. Philip Neri Church in the Jaffna district. Brown took over the role of parish priest after his predecessor, Amal Raj, requested a transfer from St. Philip Neri after having allegedly received death threats from a local Sri Lankan Navy officer.
As part of ongoing military operations, the Sri Lankan Army shelled the St. Philip Neri's Church in Allaipiddy on August 13, 2006 killing 15 refugees sheltering there.

Brown was publicly rebuked by navy officials for having moved all 300, mostly Catholic, Allaipiddy families to a safer Catholic church at Kayts eight miles away during military operations. Brown was also accused by the Sri Lankan Navy commanding officer of Allaipiddy of helping the rebel group Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) to dig bunkers.

Disappearance
According to an Amnesty International report, on the day they went missing, Brown and Wenceslaus Vinces Vimalathas were travelling by motorbike to Allaipiddy village, when they met a friend who accompanied them to the Allaipiddy Sri Lankan Navy checkpoint. The friend left the two men standing at the checkpoint at approximately 2.10pm. An eyewitness confirmed that they saw the two men shortly after this, travelling through Allaipiddy on a motorbike. The eyewitness then saw two motorbikes each carrying three armed men wearing bulletproof vests, following Brown and Vimalathas along the road. The six armed men then stopped outside St. Mary's Church in Allaipiddy and following some discussion, one of the motorbikes turned back in the direction of the SLN Allaipiddy checkpoint. When the eyewitness reached the SLN Navy checkpoint in order to leave Allaipiddy, they saw the same three armed men who had turned back from St. Mary's Church talking to the SLN personnel and pointing in the direction of Allaipiddy. The armed men then allegedly rode back to Allaipiddy village, taking a different route than they had before.

Inquiries about the whereabouts of Brown and Vimalathas were made at a number of churches across the Jaffna peninsula and in surrounding areas. Rear Admiral Upali Ranaweera, Commander of the SLN's Northern Region, denied that the two men were arrested. Navy personnel at the Allaipiddy checkpoint stated that Brown and Vimalathas passed through the Allaipiddy checkpoint and returned soon after, travelling in the direction of Jaffna town. However, local police have been unable to process their request to the Navy to produce the evidence of their return to the Jaffna city. A complaint was lodged with local police as well as the Human Rights Commission regarding their disappearance and investigations took place into their whereabouts.

Controversy over found body
According to local newspapers a ""mutilated torso"" packed in a sand bag found off the coast of the Jaffna peninsula, near Pungudutheevu, on March 14, 2007 was identified as the dead priest. However, the Sri Lankan government announced in June 2007 that subsequent DNA analyses had proved that the remains were not those of either man.

Life 
Vincenzo Tomasselli was born in Florence. He studied medicine but then decided to be a dancer. He was trained by Gasparo Angiolini, just two years older than his student. In 1759 he joined the company of Giuseppe Forti, which performed in Venice at the Teatro San Moisè, with the stage name Galeotti. In 1761, he joined the dance company of another Venice theatre, San Benedetto. In 1763 he married the principal dancer Antonia Guidi, who was trained in Stuttgart by Jean-Georges Noverre.

In 1765, at the Teatro San Benedetto, he choreographed his first works. Next season he worked at the Teatro San Luca. In 1766–1767, the couple performed in Torino Opera and in 1767–1769 again in Venice, in San Benedetto. In 1769–1770 they were in London at the Haymarket Opera where Galeotti choreographed dances for Christoph Willibald Gluck's Orfeo ed Euridice. In 1771–1772 they worked in Milan under direction of Jean-Georges Noverre. In 1772–1773 they went back to Venice, to the Teatro San Moisè and in 1773 moved to Genoa.

In 1775 Galeotti was called to Copenhagen assume the directorship of the Royal Danish Ballet replacing another Italian, Antonio Sacco. His wife Antonia entered the company a year later but soon left the stage in order to teach. Galeotti remained in Copenhagen for the rest of his life, obtaining Danish citizenship and a lifetime directorship in 1781. Galeotti continued to perform in mime roles until 1812. In that year, very unusually for a performing artist, he was made a Knight of the Order of the Dannebrog. In 1814, he was also awarded a titulary professorship.

Galeotti was the teacher of the noted ballerina Anine Frølich, making her the star of his innovative choreography. They were also romantically involved, but the relationship ended unhappily.

Works 

Galeotti was a leading innovator of ballet in Scandinavia. He was instrumental in introducing the Ballet d'action to Danmark and created the first ballet with a Nordic subject (Lagertha, 1801, based on the legendary Viking shieldmaiden), as well as the first choreographies inspired by William Shakespeare (Romeo and Juliet, 1811, and Macbeth, 1816), with music written by Claus Schall.

He created more than 50 works, often adapting French tragedies or moral dramas for ballet. Galeotti's most lasting success, and the only work by him still commonly performed today, is Amors og Balletmesterens Luner (The Whims of Cupid and the Ballet Master, 1786), which is the oldest European ballet still danced to its original choreography and music (by ); it has been staged more than 500 times.

He served as Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) for North Norfolk from 1997 until the 2001 general election, when he lost his seat to Norman Lamb of the Liberal Democrats by 483 votes. In 2015, he was appointed as a life peer in the House of Lords.

Early life
He was educated at Charterhouse School and Pembroke College, Cambridge, where he gained an exhibition and MA in Law.

During his time at Cambridge, he helped to launch the Cambridge University Industrial Society, a student group, which subsequently spread to many other UK universities. He was Chairman of the Cambridge University Conservative Association and was elected an officer of Cambridge University Students’ Union.

Career

From 1977 to 1980, he worked for the investment banks Lehman Brothers and Lazard Frères in New York, training as an investment banker, and qualified as a barrister in 1976, becoming a member of Gray's Inn. He was seconded to the British Steel Corporation to work with Sir Ian MacGregor. He was appointed Managing director of British Steel Service Centres Ltd and later appointed Commercial Director British Steel, establishing joint ventures in China, Turkey, Europe and North America. After British Steel, he managed a number of private steel and manufacturing businesses.

He was elected as MP for North Norfolk in 1997 and he became Chief Executive of the Conservative Party and its deputy chairman and a member of the trade and industry select committee. In 2002 he was appointed chairman of the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital NHS Trust, resigning in November 2006. He was acting chairman of the Conservative Party in 2001.

On 14 November 2006, he was arrested, among others, by Norfolk Constabulary investigating allegations of financial irregularities at Cawston Park Hospital previously known as Cawston College, a private psychiatric hospital in Cawston, Norfolk. He was cleared of involvement in the alleged fraud on 15 February 2007 and subsequently reappointed as chairman of the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital NHS Trust.
In 2009, he was invited to be Chairman of Ormiston Victory Academy in Norwich. He founded and chairs two free schools, the Jane Austen College, and Sir Isaac Newton Free School, a sixth-form college specialising in sciences and mathematics. He is also the chairman of Norwich Primary Academy. In 2012, he became a Trustee of the Inspiration Trust. From 2005 to 2009 he was Chairman of Friends of Families House.

On 28 January 2013 he was appointed as Chairman of the Care Quality Commission.  He was said by the Health Service Journal to be the 23rd most powerful person in the English NHS in December 2013.  In April 2014 he had a hip replacement operation paid for by private insurance but was treated in a public ward at the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital NHS Trust.

In March 2015 he told a conference that ""the role of the market is hugely limited in health and social care, in part because many of the people who need care the most – as many homeless people are – are often unheard; they have no power. The market requires people with power, people who can choose [in order to bring improvement]. In healthcare that’s not the case.”  His stance appeared to conflict with the assumptions underlying the Health and Social Care Act 2012.

On 14 May 2015 David Prior was appointed Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health in David Cameron's Conservative ministry and subsequently created a Life Peer as Baron Prior of Brampton, of Swannington in the County of Norfolk on 29 May 2015.  He was reckoned by the Health Service Journal to be the twelfth most influential person in the English NHS in 2015.

In October 2016, Prior said the result of the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum was ""a terrible mistake"". Additionally, he expressed his support for remaining in the European single market.

On 21 December 2016, he was appointed as Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. A large part of this role was the development of the Government's new industrial strategy. He resigned from the Government in October 2017.

On 5 September 2018, he was invited to attend a pre-appointment hearing with the Health Select Committee prior to being appointed Chair of NHS England, succeeding Sir Malcolm Grant. His appointment was for four years from 31 October 2018. He resigned the Conservative whip in October 2018.

CPCI was established in 1977 to serve the central Pennsylvania area through ministries that edify and encourage the body of Christ.

Ministries

Way Truth Life Radio 
Way Truth Life Radio is non-commercial, listener-supported radio broadcasting from two stations in central Pennsylvania. WTLR, 89.9 FM has served Pennsylvania's heartland since 1978. WQJU, 107.1, Mifflintown, became CPCI's second full-power radio station in January 1993. Serving listeners in an area to the south and east of WTLR's broadcast range, WQJU operates as a satellite of WTLR, bringing identical programming to Mifflin, Snyder, Juniata, and Perry counties.

Camp Kanesatake 
Camp Kanesatake became a part of the ministries of CPCI in 1989 when the board of directors was made aware of the availability of the camp and the need for Christian camping in the central Pennsylvania area. Constructed in 1923 by the Pennsylvania Sabbath School Association. CPCI's purchase of the camp ensured the continuation of this heritage into the 21st century.

Puppets With a Purpose 
Puppets With a Purpose (PWAP) is a Christian-based youth ministry whose purpose is to share the Gospel of Jesus Christ with fellow Christians and non-Christians alike through the use of puppets.  From its inception in 1993 to today, PWAP continuously produces short stories mixed with music told by a team of 10-15 puppeteers and assistants.

Outreach is a major goal of PWAP.  In addition to local performances at churches and youth events, the PWAP team began to take mission trips to foreign countries for the purpose of creating new puppet ministry teams in those locations. In 2005 the team traveled to Peru to form a group of Christian puppeteers to minister to the local population.

Ezekiel Forum 
The speaker series sponsored by CPCI is known as the Ezekiel Forum.  Recent events have included Dr. Peter Jones speaking on the book Da Vinci Code, sponsorship of internationally known theologian and apologist Ravi Zacharias, and financial teaching from the Biblical Stewardship Series.

Governance 
CPCI is governed by an uncompensated board of directors made up of Christian laymen from various area churches.  The board reflects CPCI's commitment to non-denominational ministry.  Although they come from different churches and theological persuasions, the directors lay these differences aside in order to work together in a cooperative effort to exalt their Lord.

Registrations and memberships 
CPCI is registered as a not-for-profit corporation by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and recognized by the Internal Revenue Service as a 501(c)(3) organization.  It is a member of the Christian Stewardship Association.

Marketed in Europe, Mexico, Canada, Japan, Egypt, Australia, and South America as a Chrysler, the Neon was offered in multiple versions and configurations over its production life, which ended after the 2005 model year.

The Neon nameplate was subsequently resurrected in 2016 for the Dodge Neon, a rebadged variant of Fiat Tipo sedan for the Mexican market.

1991 concept car
The Neon nameplate first appeared as a concept car in 1991 under the Dodge brand. Although radically styled and clearly not production-ready featuring sliding suicide doors, the Neon concept resembled the future production vehicle.

The Neon concept was designed by Chrysler designers who had joined the company from Chrysler's buyout of American Motors Corporation (AMC) in 1987.

First generation (1993)

The first generation Neon was introduced in January 1994 and manufactured until August 1999. It was available as a four-door notchback sedan and a two-door notchback coupe. Available engines were SOHC and DOHC versions of Chrysler's 2.0 L 4-cylinder engine producing  at 6,000 rpm and  at 5,000 rpm or  at 6,500 rpm and  at 5,600 rpm, respectively; transaxle options were a 3-speed Torqueflite automatic or a five-speed manual.

The car was badged and sold as both a Dodge and a Plymouth in the United States and Canada; in Mexico was sold as Dodge and Chrysler, and in Europe, Australia and other export markets it was sold as the Chrysler Neon. At the Neon's release, then president of Chrysler Corporation Bob Lutz said, ""There's an old saying in Detroit: 'Good, fast, or cheap. Pick any two.' We refuse to accept that."" The Japanese press touted the Neon as the ""Japanese car killer"", due to a spiralling Yen due to the Japanese ""bubble economy"" crash and the lower production cost of the Neon. The Neon also became the first Chrysler small car sold in Japan but despite focused attention, only 994 were sold in Japan between June to December 1996. The Neon was classed in the larger ""Normal sized Passenger vehicles"" tax bracket according to Japanese Government dimension regulations which obligated Japanese owners for additional yearly road taxes which affected sales. The Neon received praise for its appearance, price, and power when compared to competing cars such as the Honda Civic DX at , the Civic EX at , the Nissan Sentra at , the Ford Escort ZX2 at , the Toyota Corolla at , the Saturn S-Series at  for SOHC variants and  for DOHC variants, and the Chevrolet Cavalier Base and LS models at , among others. Car and Driver tested the DOHC 5-speed equipped Neon R/T and reported that it could run 0–60 in 7.6 seconds and 15.9 seconds in the quarter mile. First-generation Neons were competitive in SCCA Solo autocross and showroom-stock road racing.

Equipment
Neons had unconventional option availability, including the lack of power windows in the rear doors. Certain color base-model Neons, including red and black, had bumper covers molded in color rather than painted. These covers, while textured and not as glossy as paint, absorbed scuffs and scrapes with less visible damage. The mid-level Highline models in 1995 and 1996 used wheel covers with a bubble design. Initially, Neons were available in many bold colors including Nitro yellow-green, Lapis Blue, Aqua, and Magenta. Paint color choices became more subdued by the 1998-1999 model years, as the majority of buyers opted for more conventional tones.

In the Australian market, Chrysler Neons came in two models, the SE and the better-equipped LX. Later, the LX model was replaced by the LE with the updated model in 1999.

In Japan, only the sedan was offered. It was very similar to those sold in the Australian market. it was equipped with amber turn signal indicators next to the tail lights to comply with Japanese regulations and a side indicator installed in the fender behind the front wheel opening.

In the United States, the lineup started out as Base, Highline, and Sport, with different styles and options in each line, but the lineup titles changed frequently (other trim lines included Expresso, SE, ES, SXT, ACR, and R/T).

In Europe, the car was available with a 1.8 L engine. Europe received one limited edition model, the CS that came only in Platinum paint. It was fitted with the  SOHC engine, American R/T specification suspension (slightly lower,  rear,  front), rear spoiler, unique alloy wheels, standard leather interior, dual stainless steel exhaust, a six CD changer, and a shorter 5-speed manual gearbox.

Special models

ACR

The ACR Neon, available with the DOHC engine, featured four-wheel disc brakes, Arvin non-adjustable struts for 1995–1996 models and Koni adjustable dampers for 1997–1999 models, thicker anti-sway bars, stiffer suspension bushings, fast-ratio steering, heavy-duty wheel hubs, and a five-speed manual transmission with a shorter .81 fifth gear and final drive ratio of 3.94 for quicker acceleration. 1995 through 1997 models featured adjustable camber. The computer-controlled speed limiter was removed from 1995 ACR models (limited to  on later models), and ABS was also, to save weight. The ACR offers no badging to distinguish it from other Neon models; the only visible differences are a bumper with fog light holes, but no fog lights and a lack of side moldings. For 1995, the ACR was only offered to SCCA members, but in subsequent years it was available to the general public. The name ""ACR"" was initially the internal ordering code for the ""Competition Package"", as it was termed in dealer materials; however, as knowledge of the model spread, the ACR name stuck. The backronym ""American Club Racer"" was coined due to its popularity with club and grassroots racers. To save weight, both the standard A/M-F/M radio with cassette player and air conditioning could be deleted, both for credit.

R/T

The R/T model (Road/Track) debuted in the 1998 model year. Offered only with a 5-speed DOHC configuration, the R/T featured many of the ACR's mechanical upgrades including the numerically higher ratio 3.94 5-speed manual transmission, with the .81 5th gear and 130 mph speed limit. The R/T, however, was intended for the street, with more comfort and convenience features standard or available, and specialized parts like the adjustable dampers removed, although the dampers, as well as the front coil springs found on R/T models, were slightly stiffer, offering an advantage over standard model Neons. R/Ts featured optional stripes over the top of the car, silver ""R/T"" badging on the front door panels and the right side of the trunk deck lid, and a functional wing. The ""Stripe Delete"" option was available from the factory, but with no credit to the Neon's price. All striped R/Ts (black, red, blue) had silver-colored stripes, with the exception of the White R/Ts, which came with dark blue colored stripes. The R/T was available in the 4-door body style with limited numbers made.

Second generation (2000) 

Sales of the second generation model started with the 2000 model year and production ended with the 2005 model year. The second-generation Neon was only available as a four-door sedan. In some global sales regions, including the U.S., the sole engine was the 2.0 L SOHC engine, the power output remaining at . An optional Magnum engine configuration (with an active intake manifold, and other engine revisions to increase power) that produced  was available. Both engines had a redline of 6762 rpm.

The second generation was more refined than the first-generation car. It was advertised that the second generation Neon had over 1,000 refinements from the original generation. The first generation's frameless windows were replaced with a full-framed door. Other NVH refinements were implemented. The new interior and greater size increased weight. The DOHC engine (Chrysler code name ECC) was no longer available.

In 2000, the R/T trim returned after a one-year hiatus. The R/T consisted of a new  SOHC Magnum 2.0 L Engine,  wheels, spoiler, dual chrome exhaust tips, quicker steering box and stiffer springs. The 2001 and 2002 R/Ts had a flat, 'hammerhead' spoiler. From 2000 to 2003, the R/T was sold as a Chrysler in the United Kingdom. The Neon was offered with a sport package for the 2001 model year only commemorating Dodge's return to the NASCAR scene, called the Motorsports Edition. It was available on SE, ES, and R/T and on SE/ES models, consisted of an R/T wing, R/T  wheels, R/T springs, Goodyear NASCAR raised yellow-lettering tires, 'Dodge Motorsports' side decals, white instrument cluster, and R/T steering box. SE and ES cars were an R/T visually except for the lack of dual exhaust, R/T lower moldings, fog lamps, and R/T exclusive front bumper. The SE and ES only came equipped with the base model's  engine and was available with an automatic transmission (unlike the manual-only R/T model), the R/T retained the 150hp Magnum engine. In 2001, there was also a Sport Appearance Package available on SE and ES, which added the R/T wing and 16” wheels as well as other option availability. 2001 was the last year for the Plymouth Neon, and the Plymouth brand as well. The last Plymouth Neon, which was also the last Plymouth ever produced (a silver four-door sedan), rolled off the assembly line on June 28, 2001.

The former Dodge and Plymouth Neon were briefly sold under the Chrysler name in Canada from 1999 to 2002, until being renamed as Dodge SX 2.0 for 2003. As before, in Europe, Australia, Mexico, Asia, and South America, it continued to be sold as a Chrysler, as Dodge and Plymouth passenger cars were not marketed outside the U.S. and Canada at the time. Besides the 2.0 L engine, it used the same Tritec 1.6 L unit found in the MINI prior to 2007. The 1.6 L unit is a variation of the 2.0 L SOHC engine designed by Chrysler and built by Tritec.

Originally, the second generation Neon featured a five-speed manual transmission using the former ACR gear ratios to improve acceleration. However, this hurt gas mileage and made the car noisier on the highway, and eventually, the original gear ratios were restored. A four-speed automatic (41TE) was offered in the Neon for the 2002 model year, and the 03-05 received an updated 40TE four-speed auto, replacing the earlier 3-speed 31TH. 

The Chrysler Neon was renamed Dodge SX 2.0 in Canada for 2003 and sold at Dodge dealerships. In Australia and Canada, the Chrysler Neon was discontinued in 2002.
In 2002, the front clip was changed to match the R/T and ACR front clip with the exception of missing a lower lip.

The Neon was facelifted once again for 2003 with large ""crosseyed"" headlights and crosshair grille to make it look more like a Dodge Caravan and Dodge Stratus.

The ACR model was discontinued for 2003; the R/T model for 2004. The Chrysler Neon continued to be sold in Europe until 2004.

In Brazil, the Neon was marketed as a luxury mid-size sedan; for Mexico it was a competitor to the Ford Escort, and sold as a Chrysler with either the 1.6 or 2.0 L engine and European-style taillights (with separate amber indicator lights), except for the R/T model, which was a Dodge, with U.S.-style taillights.

For the Dutch market, the Neon proved more successful than for the rest of the Continent. Trim levels were 2.0 LX and 2.0 SE. However, some grey import versions came in from Mexico.

This generation continued to be offered in Japan from 1999 to 2001. The Japanese version was installed with a leather interior and was marketed as a small luxury car to Japanese consumers. In 2002, the Neon was replaced by the Chrysler PT Cruiser in Japan.

Final year
DaimlerChrysler discontinued the Neon, with the final cars assembled on September 23, 2005 at the Belvidere Assembly plant in Belvidere, Illinois. The Neon was replaced in the spring of 2006 with the 2007 Dodge Caliber, which is based on the shared Chrysler/Mitsubishi Motors GS platform. Like the Neon, the Caliber had an SRT-4 variant, but like the standard Caliber, it used a completely different engine. The Belvidere plant underwent retooling for the Caliber, Jeep Compass, and Patriot.

In markets like Australia the Neon range was reduced to either 2.0 LX or 2.0 SE models.

Safety
The first generation Neon earned a ""Poor"" rating in an offset frontal Crash test conducted by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. The second generation Neon earned a higher ""Marginal"" rating. The second generation were rated as ""Poor"" in the side impact crash test (IIHS Safety ratings go from ""Poor"", to ""Marginal"", ""Acceptable"" and ""Good""). By comparison, the Chevrolet Cavalier performed worse in the small car category in 2005, the Neon's final year. Other cars made from 2000 to 2005 that were rated ""Poor"" when tested without optional side airbags included the Ford Focus, Toyota Corolla, Toyota Prius, Mitsubishi Lancer, and Chevrolet Cobalt. No small car made in this period, tested without side airbags, achieved better than a ""Poor.""

In 2005, the Institute carried out side-impact tests on 14 small car models, simulating an impact with an SUV. Among these, the Neon performed the worst. IIHS stated that the Neon had ""...major problems beginning with its structure. This car is a disaster...The structure is poor...If this had been a real driver in a real crash, it's likely it wouldn’t have been survivable...if safety is a priority, the Neon is a small car to be avoided.""

Second generation headrests were rated as ""Poor"".

Driver deaths fatality risks statistics — published by the IIHS — rated the Neon and 15 other vehicles among the ""Highest rates of driver deaths."", The Neon had 161 driver deaths per million registered vehicle years, while the average for the Neon class (4-door small) was 103. Other small cars on the list included the Acura RSX (202), Kia Spectra hatchback (191), and the Mitsubishi Eclipse (169).

Sales

Third generation (2016)

The third generation of the Dodge Neon is the sedan version of Fiat's Project Aegea, adapted for the Mexican and Middle Eastern markets as well as marking a comeback of the Neon nameplate after an 11-year absence. 

Released for the 2017 model year, around the same time the Dodge Dart was expected to end production, there were reports that it would be sold in the U.S. and Canadian markets by 2018 as a replacement for the Dart. Consistent with FCA's plans to dedicate U.S. production to Jeep and Ram vehicles while using the North American Free Trade Agreement to make Chrysler and Dodge passenger cars in Canada and Mexico, the Neon will be built and imported from Turkey. 

Plans to market the third-generation Neon vehicle north of Mexico were dropped following General Motors and Ford each paring down their own passenger car lineups in the U.S., including ending sales of potential compact-sized rivals Chevrolet Cruze and Ford Focus in North America.

The club played their home matches at Lamport Stadium in Toronto, Ontario.

History  
Toronto Chile Lindo was formed in 1975 and represented the Chilean Canadian community in the Greater Toronto Area. The club competed in the Liga Hispanoamerica de Football Amateur (LHFA). In 1985, Chile secured the league title and repeated its success the following season. Lindo along with two other Latin American-based clubs Nacional Latino and Toronto International were given franchises in the National Soccer League (NSL) in 1987. The club recruited former Chilean international Carlos Rivas as their head coach.  

Chile's debut season in the NSL was unfortunately plagued with many controversies as many of their matches were disrupted because of fan violence, and disruptive behavior from the players. One notable incident occurred during an NSL Cup match against Windsor Wheels where the match was abandoned after a fan invasion which resulted in a brawl. It was later reported that Chile Lindo received a league record fine of $5000 for previous on-field incidents, and their league representative was fined and suspended for two years for enticing their supporters to riot. In regards to the match against Windsor harsh measures were placed on Chile with four players receiving lengthy suspensions. The suspensions caused a change in the team management as head coach Rivas was suspended from the league for four years. Rivas replacement was former head coach Modesto Juárez.  

Despite Chile's problems from the previous season, they returned for the 1988 season. In their second season in the NSL the club finished in seventh place. The following season Chile's franchise was revoked due to continuing behavioral problems.

She had started a very successful banking system in the villages of Tamil Nadu, and has done significant contributions to reduce poverty and debt grievances by empowering women.  Her efforts in starting a savings unit among the women of the debt stricken village of Pullucheri had become so successful that soon many groups sprung up in this region which had tried to emulate the same model within their community. The Kalanjiam microcredit movement received a huge boost from her dedication and contributions, reaching out to many women living under poverty.

Chinna Pillai is illiterate and can only sign her name. She was recognized as a leader because of her skills as a negotiator. She bargained on behalf of workers and eventually the employers realized that there may be some benefit in paying higher wages.

Once, Chinna Pillai had gone to the collector's office to demand for a contract for fishing in the fishing pond of the Pulliseri village for the poorer communities of the village, which earlier was always given to the richer landlords of the village. The collector after listening to their grievances had then encouraged them to bid for the contract. One of the landlords had objected to this, and having powerful political connections as well as being an influential man in the village denied them the right to work in the fields. Not being intimidated, her group decided to find work outside the village, and many people were willing to employ them. Today, pisciculture is a source of income for the Kalanjiam group.

Recognition
Chinna Pillai was one of five women to receive the Stree Shakti Puraskar in 1999. In a picture perfect moment for the press, then-Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee bowed down in respect and touched her feet while presenting her with the award. She had received the Padma Shri for her service in 2019.

Lady Six Sky (possibly Lady Wak Chanjalam Lem/Win? in ancient Mayan), also known as Lady Wac Chanil Ahau or Wak Chanil Ajaw (d. 741 CE), was a Maya queen of Naranjo who was born in Dos Pilas. She lived in Naranjo from 682 to her death (or shortly before her death) in 741. During that time, she probably served as de facto ruler of the city; however, monuments such as Stela 24 suggest she was never formally recognized as such, since she continued to use the emblem glyph of Dos Pilas throughout her life.

Because the reading of her name is currently contested, scholars typically refer to her as Lady Six Sky, which is the English translation of a readable portion of her name (Wak Chan meaning Six Sky).

Monuments that refer to Lady Six Sky include: Naranjo stelae 3, 18, 24, 29, 31, and 46.

 Personal life 
Lady Six Sky was the daughter of B'alaj Chan K'awiil of Dos Pilas and a woman who may have been named Lady B'ulu ? or Lady B'uluka'l. Though Lady B'ulu was not B'alaj Chan K'awiil's first wife, she carried the prestigious title ochk'in kalo'mte  (loosely, ""western autocrat"") on Stela 24, suggesting a high level of political power.

In 682 CE, Lady Six Sky arrived in Naranjo to establish a new dynasty at the behest of her father. She was part of an arranged marriage between the Maya cities of Dos Pilas and Naranjo (in modern Guatemala) to bring Naranjo into the Calakmul–Dos Pilas alliance. This may have been a direct response to Tikal's recent defeat of Calakmul.

Little is known about her husband, though he may have been a low-status cousin of the previous king, K’ahk’ Xiiw Chan Chaahk. This king had been defeated two years earlier by Caracol, leaving a power vacuum. Her husband's name appears on Naranjo Stela 46. Though the reading is not yet fully deciphered, it was something like K'ak' U ? Chan Chaak.

During her time in Naranjo, she presumably served as ruler of the city, though in text (such as on stelae 24 and 29), she still carried the title of Holy Lady of Dos Pilas. A little more than five years after her arrival, on January 6, 688, she gave birth to a son, the future king of Naranjo Kʼakʼ Tiliw Chan Chaak. His birth is commemorated among other high points of the queen's life on stelae 24 and 29.

For many years, scholars debated if K'ak' Tiliw was her son or not, but the more recently discovered Stela 46, which was discovered in 2017, includes a definitive relationship statement between the two.

Their relationship may have been an uneasy one; Christophe Helmke notes that the queen erected monuments that centered herself as ruler well into K'ak' Tiliw Chan Chaak's adulthood, suggesting that she competed with him for power and influence. K'ak' Tiliw Chan Chaak died of unknown causes in his early forties, and Lady Six Sky seems to have promoted a new ruler, Yax Mayuy Chan Chaak. This ruler appears on Naranjo Stela 18 in text that was probably a late addition to the monument; here, his presence at important events, including a star war with Komkom, are used to imply his fitness to rule. He may have been a younger brother of K'ak' Tiliw Chan Chaak.

A name that is probably hers appears in reference to a scattering ritual at Dos Pilas on February 10 or 11, 741; this may be the date of her death, though this fact is contested.

 Daykeeper and Warrior-Queen 
Despite never receiving the title Holy Lady of Naranjo, Lady Six Sky commissioned monuments in Naranjo that note she performed important rituals, some shortly after her arrival. For example, Stela 29 describes a burning ritual on August 31 682 CE, just three days after her arrival in Naranjo. But her early days in Naranjo may have been beset by rival claims to the throne, and she did not begin seriously commissioning monuments until almost two decades into her rule.

That said, she may have been responsible for a method of counting moon phases that spread during the Period of Uniformity; during this time, Glyph C values across the Maya area remained consistent. She had a penchant for celebrating the rare ""Tikal Cycle"" period endings which happened on #.#.3.0.0 days of the Maya Long Count calendar; she celebrated 9.13.3.0.0 (March 1, 695 CE) and 9.14.3.0.0 (November 17, 714 CE), both memorialized on Stela 29.

She also supervised the production of high-quality pottery, a trend which continued during the rule of her son, who became known as Pure (or White) Artisan for his patronage of the arts.

Additionally, she is shown on monuments taking on the role of a warrior-king by standing over a trampled captive, an unusual representation for a woman. Naranjo Stela 24 from April 17, 699 CE, is one such depiction; there, she stands on a captive from the small polity of K'inichil Kab. Stela 29 from November 17, 714 CE also shows her standing on a captive, though it is too eroded to make out the captive's name or place of origin. Besides K'inichil Kab, she was involved in the sacking of at least nine other polities, and she waged a victorious war against the Komkom polity in April 726 CE, according to Stela 18. Her son K'ak' Tiliw Chan Chaak and future Naranjo leader Yax Mayuy Chan Chaak were also both involved.

On Stela 24, she also appears dressed in the net skirt of the maize god, another uncommon trait for women. She may have taken the name ""Six"" because of its association with the maize god, though she also emphasized her relationship with the moon goddess. The combination of maize god and moon goddess symbolism may have been a deliberate message that the ruler was capable of both masculine and feminine roles.

For example, on Stela 24, she is described as ub'aah (short for ub'aahila'n) ti yax k'uh, ""she is portrayed as the first god,"" meaning she was seen as literally serving as a vessel for this god. On the side of Stela 24, this ritual is described in more detail; here the god is referred to as the moon goddess despite the net skirt which was worn mostly by men. This ritual took place on April 17, 699 CE. According to Stela 47, she also impersonated the moon goddess on February 9, 726 CE, which was the Maya new year, following the 260-day sacred calendar.

When K'ahk' Tiliw Chan Chaak was about 13, his mother was the one who publicly celebrated the half-k'atun anniversary of 9.14.10.0.0 (October 11, 721 CE) with the erection of Stela 24, suggesting she was serving as his regent at that time. However, she may never have been the formal head of government; Stela 24 described K’ak’ Tiliw Chan Chaak as the 38th head of Naranjo's government, whereas it should count him as the 39th if Six Sky were included.

 Rediscovery in the 20th Century 
Tatiana Proskouriakoff first recognized the name of the queen in the 1960s during her pioneering studies of the historical side of Maya inscriptions. She nicknamed the queen ""Lady of Tikal"" because of the use of the Mutal emblem glyph; it wasn't until later that scholars realized more than one city used the same glyph.

 In popular culture 
 Lady Six Sky leads the Mayan civilization in the New Frontier season pass of the 4X video game Civilization VI.
 She is the subject of the 2012 historical fiction Lady Six Sky'' by Elaine Lowe and has been depicted in contemporary art by Miguel Omaña.

In 2005, the Comprehensive Peace Agreement led to a resolution of some of the armed conflict in Sudan, including the 2011 South Sudanese independence referendum and the secession of South Sudan. The 2006 Abuja and 2011 Doha Darfur Peace Agreements aimed to resolve the conflict in Darfur. The August 2019 Draft Constitutional Declaration, signed by military and civilian representatives during the 2018–19 Sudanese Revolution, requires that a peace agreement be made within the first six months of the 39-month transition period to democratic civilian government. This article mainly covers the component of the peace process that started in 2019.

A first round of negotiations took place in Juba in mid-September. In the second round in October 2019, agreements were signed on 18 October on the Two Areas track between the government and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement-North (al-Hilu) (SPLM-N (al-Hilu)) and on the Darfur track between the government and the Sudan Revolutionary Front (SRF). The third round started in mid-December on the eastern Sudan track, the Two Areas track with the SPLM-N (Agar), and the Darfur track.

MANSAM and the No to Oppression against Women Initiative called repeatedly for women to be included in the peace process.

Draft constitutional requirements
The 4 August Draft Constitutional Declaration lists ""achieving a just and comprehensive peace, ending the war by addressing the roots of the Sudanese problem"" as Article 7.(1), the first listed item in its ""Mandate of the Transitional Period"", and gives details in Chapter 15, Articles 67 and 58 of the document. Article 67.(b) says that a peace agreement should be completed within six months of the signing of the Draft Constitutional Declaration. Article 67.(c) requires women to participate in all levels of the peace procedure and for United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325 to be applied, and legal establishment of women's rights is covered in Article 67.(d). Other mechanisms for implementing the comprehensive peace process are listed in Articles 67.(e) (stopping hostilities, opening humanitarian assistance corridors, prisoner releases and exchanges), 67.(f) (amnesties for political leaders and members of armed opposition movements), and 67.(g) (transitional justice and accountability for crimes against humanity and war crimes and trials in national and international courts). Article 68 lists 13 ""essential issues for peace negotiations"".

Conflict incidents
During mid-September to mid-November 2019, 40 assaults by Sudanese security forces against civilians took place in Darfur, in which civilians were killed or wounded, in Mershing, Shangil Tobai, Gray Kalakl, Andro, Kadner, Mukjar, Gereida and Krenk. A representative of internally displace people (IDPs) described the security situation as unchanged since the power transfer from the Transitional Military Council to the civilian–military Sovereignty Council and civilian cabinet.

Armed clashes between state security forces and Sudan Liberation Movement/Army (al-Nur; SLM-al-Nur) occurred. , SLM (al-Nur) refused to join the Juba peace process.

Geographical negotiation tracks
The peace negotiations were classified into parallel tracks on five geographical regions:
Darfur: a political agreement including a ceasefire and humanitarian assistance was signed by Hemetti and the SRF on 21 October 2019; a framework agreement was signed on 28 December 2019; a final peace agreement was signed on 31 August 2020;

Negotiations and agreements

September 2019 Juba negotiations
In September 2019, following the transfer of power from the Transitional Military Council to the Sovereignty Council of Sudan, South Sudanese president Salva Kiir hosted talks in Juba between rebel movements, military members of the Sovereignty Council, and the Sudanese prime minister. Rebel movements involved in the Juba meetings included four Darfuri armed groups, the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM), the Sudan Liberation Movement/Army led by Minni Minawi (SLM-MM), the Sudan Liberation Movement–Transitional Council, and the Alliance of Sudan Liberation Forces; the Blue Nile/South Kordofan rebel group Sudan People's Liberation Movement-North al-Hilu faction (SPLM-N (al-Hilu)); and the Sudan-wide Sudan Revolutionary Front (SRF) that in 2011 allied together a wide range of Sudanese armed rebel groups. Hemetti, Sovereignty Council military member and leader of the Rapid Support Forces, arrived in Juba for the negotiations on 9 September.

Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok and three cabinet ministers planned to arrive in Juba on 12 September for the negotiations.

Sudan researcher Eric Reeves expressed scepticism about the possibility of Hemetti being ""ready to make peace"", arguing that Hemetti was responsible for crimes against humanity and genocide during the wars in Darfur and South Kordofan.

October 2019 signed agreements
On 18 October, two separate meetings took place in Juba between rebel and Sovereignty Council (head of state) representatives, on the Two Areas and Darfur tracks.

In the Two Areas track, after a three-hour negotiating session mediated by a South Sudanese mediation team, Amar Daldoum, on behalf of the SPLM-N (al-Hilu) and Shams al-Din Khabbashi, on behalf of the Sovereignty Council signed an agreement on political, security and humanitarian procedures. The agreement was cosigned by the chair of the mediation team, Tut Galwak. The SPLM-N (al-Hilu) and the Sovereignty Council planned to develop a Declaration of Principles to organise continuation of the peace process and to present their political vision.

Independently on 18 October, the first Darfur track meeting between the SRF and Sovereignty Council representatives took place under South Sudanese mediation, creating a joint committee. The joint committee stated its intention to study the 11 September Juba Declaration, and propose how to move from confidence-building measures to negotiations on core issues. On 21 October, el-Hadi Idris, on behalf of the SRF, and Hemetti, on behalf of the Sovereignty Council signed a political agreement (co-signed by a South Sudanese mediator) including a renewed ceasefire, the delivering of humanitarian assistance by government agencies to areas under conflict, and commitment to negotiate further.

Following the 18 October meetings, Tut Galwak stated that Sudan, South Sudan and other African countries are committed ""to end all forms of war"" in Africa by the end of 2020.

December talks
The third round of negotiations started in Juba in mid-December 2019, after having been planned to start on 21 November 2019. The negotiation round was delayed for several weeks because of ""the commitment of some of the armed movements to workshops related to the peace process"", according to South Sudanese mediator Tut Galwak. The Forces of Freedom and Change (FFC) agreed with the SRF to delay the creation of the Transitional Legislative Council to 31 December, giving the SRF, SPLM-N (al-Hilu) and the government time to reach an agreement prior to the creation of the Legislative Council.

On 16 December, the SRF and ""government representatives"" discussed the eastern Sudan track. The government representatives wished to suspend talks until ""civil leaders and prominent figures"" from eastern Sudan were included; the SRF refused to wait, arguing that it would ""[contradict] the Juba Declaration"" and ""hamper the negotiation tracks [which] are all intertwined"".

On 17 December, on the Two Areas track, Hemetti and Malik Agar, head of SPLM-N (Agar), signed an agreement establishing a ""humanitarian protocol and a ceasefire"". The agreement includes a ceasefire monitoring group with three representatives from both sides and a South Sudanese chair, to be located in Khartoum, with a sub-office in Kadugli and another in Ed Damazin; and the sending of a joint mission to the Two Areas to assess humanitarian needs and plan and carry out a humanitarian action plan.

On 19 December, in the Darfur track, the SRF and government representatives created a committee, called a joint mechanism, for visiting Darfur with the help of the United Nations–African Union Mission in Darfur (UNAMID) in order to select ""real representatives of the stakeholders"". UNAMID committed itself to providing transport of the stakeholders to Juba for the negotiations. El Hadi Idris of the SRF described the creation of the mechanism as ""an important breakthrough"". Detailed Darfur track negotiations were expected to continue in Juba for several weeks.

South Sudanese mediator Dams Dhieu Mathok stated that ""participation of refugees, displaced people and civil society leaders"" was being negotiated and would constitute a critical element of the Darfur peace process.

In the Two Areas track, Mathok stated that the proposal was provided by the SPLM-N (al-Hilu) delegation to government representatives.

On 24 December, Hemetti on behalf of the Sovereignty Council and el-Tom Hajo, deputy head of the SRF and head of the Central track negotiation team, signed a peace agreement regarding ""development, farmers' issues, the El Gezira and El Managil Agricultural Scheme, land rights, in addition to a fair distribution of wealth"". Hajo described the agreement as ""inclusive"" without ""quotas or positions"".

Four Darfur representatives and Khabbashi signed a framework agreement on 28 December for the Darfur track, covering issues that included power sharing, wealth sharing, transitional justice and Darfur–Darfur dialogue. On 31 December, the SRF suspended talks on the Darfur track in relation to fighting in that killed and wounded 708 people in el-Geneina. An FFC delegation visiting the area attributed the conflict to ""the deep state"" and victims attributed it to ""janjaweed"" and ""militant herders in vehicles belonging to the Rapid Support Forces"".

January 2020 agreements
On 21 January, negotiations on the eastern track were suspended until 30 January, because a consultative forum preparing for the negotiations was not inclusive enough of representatives from the Red Sea state, and too many supporters of al-Bashir's government were present in the forum.

Progress on land, transitional justice and system of government issues was made in the Darfur track on 21 January. SRF and Sovereignty Council representatives agreed on the creation of a Special Court for Darfur to conduct investigations and trials for war crimes and crimes against humanity carried out during the War in Darfur by the al-Bashir presidency and by warlords. The issue of whether or not to surrender Omar al-Bashir to the International Criminal Court was not discussed in the 21 January negotiations.

Two Areas negotiations with SPLM-N (al-Hilu) had progressed by 21 January on six framework agreement points, after a two-week pause, but disagreement remained on SPLM-N (al-Hilu)'s requirement of a secular state in South Kordofan and Nuba Mountains and Blue Nile self-determination.

On 22 January, talks on the northern track with the SRF were suspended in relation to deciding how to respect the rights of the displaced from Wadi Halfa.

On 24 January on the Two Areas track, political and security agreements, constituting a framework agreement, were signed by Hemetti on behalf of the Sovereignty Council and Ahmed El Omda Badi on behalf of SPLM-N (Agar). The agreements give legislative autonomy to South Kordofan and Blue Nile; propose solutions for the sharing of land and other resources; and aim to unify all militias and government soldiers into a single unified Sudanese military body.

On 26 January, a ""final"" peace agreement for the northern track, including issues of studies for new dams, compensation for people displaced by existing dams, road construction and burial of electronic and nuclear waste, was signed by Shamseldin Kabashi of the Sovereignty Council and Dahab Ibrahim of the Kush Movement.

February 2020 agreements
On 21 February 2020, a final agreement was made on the eastern track. The terms of the agreement included increased representation of eastern Sudan in the federal governmental structures; the establishment of a locally funded reconstruction fund; and the establishment of an internationally funded eastern Sudanese private bank to support political, educational, health and other administrative structures.

Agreements during the COVID-19 pandemic
Negotiations continued during the COVID-19 pandemic that reached Sudan in early 2020.

On 25 March, Sudan's defence minister Gamal al-Din Omar died of a heart attack in Juba after peace talks with rebel groups. Peace talks after al-Din Omar's death resumed on 2 April.

While talks in the Darfur track were ongoing, SLM (Minnawi) and JEM withdrew from the SRF in mid-May 2020, while continuing their alliance with each other and giving their new alliance the same name (Sudan Revolutionary Front). , the SLM (al-Nur) continued to boycott peace negotiations while waiting for the national authorities to make Darfur secure.

August 2020: integration of Sudan Revolutionary Front into army
On 17 August 2020, Khalid Abdin for the government, and Ahmed el-Omda for the SPLM-N (Agar) signed a security agreement for the Two Areas that included the integration of the armed forces of the Sudan Revolutionary Front into the Sudanese Armed Forces. Negotiations on political issues continued in the following days.

Negotiations with SPLM-N (al-Hilu) were planned to start around 21 August, discussing a declaration of principles, a ceasefire, and humanitarian aid.

31 August 2020 Juba peace agreement
On 31 August 2020, a comprehensive peace agreement was signed between the Sovereignty Council and the SRF, which includes SPLM-N (Minnawi) and JEM for the Darfur track and SPLM-N (Agar) for the Two Areas track. Under the terms of the agreement, the factions that signed will be entitled to three seats on the sovereignty council, a total of five ministers in the transitional cabinet and a quarter of seats in the transitional legislature. At a regional level, signatories will be entitled between 30 and 40% of the seats on transitional legislatures of their home states or regions.

3 September 2020 Addis Ababa peace agreement 
An agreement was reached between the transitional government and the SPLM-North al-Hilu rebel faction on 3 September 2020 in Addis Ababa to separate religion and state and not discriminate against anyone's ethnicity in order to secure the equal treatment of all citizens of Sudan. The declaration of principles stated that 'Sudan is a multi-racial, multi-ethnic, multi-religious and multi-cultural society. Full recognition and accommodation of these diversities must be affirmed. (...) The state shall not establish an official religion. No citizen shall be discriminated against based on their religion.' Secularism had long been a demand of the SPLM-North al-Hilu, with a spokesperson saying: 'The problem is (...) to address why people became rebels? Because there are no equal citizenship rights, there is no distribution of wealth, there is no equal development in the country, there is no equality between black and Arab and Muslim and Christian.'

3 October 2020 Juba peace agreement 
A peace agreement was signed between the SRF, SPLM–N led by Malik Agar and SLM led by Minni Minnawi and the Sudanese government, with the absence of both al Nur and al-Hilu. However, the deal included terms to integrate rebels into the security forces, and to grant them political representation and economic and land rights, in addition to a 10-year plan to invest $750 million to develop southern and western regions, and to guarantee the return for displaced people.

Women's participation
On 12 November, Ahlam Nasir, on behalf of Women of Sudanese Civic and Political Groups (MANSAM), met Sovereignty Council member Mohammed al-Ta'ishi, arguing that women should be included in the peace negotiations. Nasir presented specific proposals for women's participation in the negotiations and MANSAM's priorities in the peace process. According to Neville Melvin Gertze of Namibia who spoke at an October 2019 meeting of the United Nations Security Council, peace agreements that are the result of negotiations including women are 35 percent more likely to last at least 15 years than those which are the result of men-only negotiations.

On 17 December, the No to Oppression against Women Initiative requested the Sovereignty Council to include women, ""especially displaced women and war victims"", in the Sudanese peace process. Ihsan Fagiri of the Initiative described women's view of the peace process as extending beyond the formal signing of national-level agreements, by including ""social peace, and health and education"" and by Sudan signing the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women.

Tapps inherited some of the estates, including Hinton Admiral, which formerly belonged to Sir Peter Mews of Hinton Admiral, from his cousin, Joseph Jarvis Clerke, when the latter died without issue in 1778. In so doing he became Lord of the Manors of Hinton Admiral, Christchurch and Westover. He was also appointed High Sheriff of Hampshire in 1793.

Tapps was widely known as a ""wilful and hard living confidant"" of the Prince of Wales (later the Prince Regent), the future King George IV.

In the wake of the Christchurch Inclosure Act 1802, Tapps purchased  in what is now the borough of Bournemouth for £1,050 (1,000 guineas). As lord of the manor he was also trustee for the areas set aside as common land, for cottage dwellers to dig for turf and suchlike. In 1809 he opened a public house called The Tapps Arms (later renamed The Tregonwell Arms). It stood where the current Post Office Road meets Old Christchurch Road, Bournemouth.

In 1810 Tapps sold  on the west bank of the Bourne Stream to Lewis Tregonwell for £179 11s.

In 1834 Tapps obtained a loan of £40,000 from the Earl of Arran and John Augustus Fuller, into whose family his son had married, on the mortgage of the Tapps-Gervis estate at Hinton Admiral near Christchurch. With this money he intended to develop his estates on the east bank of the Bourne Stream. Building for this project finally began in 1837 under the direction of his son, as Tapps died in 1835.

155,"['Some research find that progenitored cells were mobile and that these progenitor cells could move through the body and migrate towards the tissue where they are needed .', 'The natural aging of cellsed , call their cellular senescence , is one of the main contributors to aging on an organismal level .']","A progenitor cell is a biological cell that can differentiate into a specific cell type. Stem cells and progenitor cells have this ability in common. However, stem cells are less specified than progenitor cells. Progenitor cells can only differentiate into their ""target"" cell type. The most important difference between stem cells and progenitor cells is that stem cells can replicate indefinitely, whereas progenitor cells can divide only a limited number of times.  Controversy about the exact definition remains and the concept is still evolving.

The terms ""progenitor cell"" and ""stem cell"" are sometimes equated.

Properties
Most progenitors are identified as oligopotent. In this point of view, they can compare to adult stem cells, but progenitors are said to be in a further stage of cell differentiation. They are in the ""center"" between stem cells and fully differentiated cells. The kind of potency they have depends on the type of their ""parent"" stem cell and also on their niche. Some research found that progenitor cells were mobile and that these progenitor cells could move through the body and migrate towards the tissue where they are needed. Many properties are shared by adult stem cells and progenitor cells.

Research 
Progenitor cells have become a hub for research on a few different fronts. Current research on progenitor cells focuses on two different applications: regenerative medicine and cancer biology. Research on regenerative medicine has focused on progenitor cells, and stem cells, because their cellular senescence contributes largely to the process of aging. Research on cancer biology focuses on the impact of progenitor cells on cancer responses, and the way that these cells tie into the immune response.

The natural aging of cells, called their cellular senescence, is one of the main contributors to aging on an organismal level. There are a few different ideas to the cause behind why aging happens on a cellular level. Telomere length has been shown to positively correlate to longevity. Increased circulation of progenitor cells in the body has also positively correlated to increased longevity and regenerative processes. Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) are one of the main focuses of this field. They are valuable cells because they directly precede endothelial cells, but have characteristics of stem cells. These cells can produce differentiated cells to replenish the supply lost in the natural process of aging, which makes them a target for aging therapy research. This field of regenerative medicine and aging research is still currently evolving.

Recent studies have shown that haematopoietic progenitor cells contribute to immune responses in the body. They have been shown to respond a range of inflammatory cytokines. They also contribute to fighting infections by providing a renewal of the depleted resources caused by the stress of an infection on the immune system. Inflammatory cytokines and other factors released during infections will activate haematopoietic progenitor cells to differentiate to replenish the lost resources.

Examples
The characterization or the defining principle of progenitor cells, in order to separate them from others, is  based on the different cell markers rather than their morphological appearance.

 Satellite cells found in muscles. They play a major role in muscle cell differentiation and injury recoveries.
 Intermediate progenitor cells formed in the subventricular zone. Some of these transit amplifying neural progenitors migrate via rostral migratory stream to the olfactory bulb and differentiate further into specific types of neural cells.
 Radial glial cells found in developing regions of the brain, most notably the cortex. These progenitor cells are easily identified by their long radial process.
 Bone marrow stromal cells found in the epidermis and make up 10% of progenitor cells. They are often classed as stem cells due to their high plasticity and potential for unlimited capacity for self-renewal.
 Periosteum contains progenitor cells that develop into osteoblasts and chondroblasts.
 Pancreatic progenitor cells are among the most studied progenitors. They are used in research to develop a cure against diabetes type-1.
 Angioblasts or endothelial progenitor cells (EPC). These are very important for research on fracture and wounds healing.
 Blast cells are involved in generation of B- and T-lymphocytes, which participate in immune responses.
 Boundary cap cells from the neural crest form a barrier between the cells of the central nervous system and cells of the peripheral nervous system. Boundary cap neural crest stem cells promote survival of mutant SOD1 motor neurons.

Development of the human cerebral cortices
Before embryonic day 40 (E40), progenitor cells generate other progenitor cells; after that period, progenitor cells produce only dissimilar mesenchymal stem cell daughters. The cells from a single progenitor cell form a proliferative unit that creates one cortical column; these columns contain a variety of neurons with different shapes.

They have performed internationally and recorded choral works including Mahler's Second Symphony and Schönberg's Moses und Aron.

History 
 was founded in 1997 by the conductor Joshard Daus as a choir for concerts and recordings, formed by young professionals, students of two music universities, the University of Mainz and the University of the Arts Bremen. Young singers from Europe, Latin America and Asia collaborate on projects for concerts and CD recordings.

The first project was in Mahler's Second Symphony, with Michael Gielen and the SWR Sinfonieorchester Baden-Baden und Freiburg. The first tour was in 1998 to Greece, conducted by Gerd Albrecht. The same year, they performed and recorded Roméo et Juliette by Berlioz with the SWR Sinfonieorchester conducted by Sylvain Cambreling. A reviewer noted their positive contribution and found their ""ghostly, emaciated, hushed singing"" in Part III impressive. In 1999, Daus conducted a tour to Spain, performing Bach's St John Passion. The same year, the choir performed in the US premiere of Bernd Alois Zimmermann's Requiem für einen jungen Dichter (Requiem for a Young Poet) at Carnegie Hall in New York City.

The choir appeared in 2000 for the first time at the Aix-en-Provence Festival in a production of Janáček's Die Sache Makropulos conducted by Simon Rattle.  They performed Zimmermann's Requiem für einen jungen Dichter at the 2003 Lucerne Festival, conducted by Ingo Metzmacher. In 2004 the group sang at the Easter Festival in Lucerne in the Requiem by Hector Berlioz. The same year, they performed Britten's War Requiem in the Mainz Cathedral with the Nordwestdeutsche Philharmonie. In 2007 the choir sang, again with the  Nordwestdeutsche Philharmonie, Poulenc's Stabat Mater and Bruckners Mass No. 3 in F minor, including at the Berliner Philharmonie. They participated in the premiere of Krzysztof Penderecki's revised Symphony No. 8 at the opening concert of the 2008 Beijing Music Festival, conducted by the composer.

 collaborated with Vladimir Jurowski and the London Philharmonic Orchestra in opera productions of the Baden-Baden Festival including Wagner's Lohengrin and Korngold's  Das Wunder der Heliane in 2008.

 was awarded the Preis der deutschen Schallplattenkritik 2009 and in 2010 the Midem Classical for their recording of Requiem für einen jungen Dichter, with soloists, the Czech Philharmonic Choir Brno, the Slovak Philharmonic Choir, the Eric Vloeimans Quintet and the Holland Symfonia, conducted by Bernhard Kontarsky for the label Cybele. They recorded in 2014 Schönberg's unfinished opera Moses und Aron with Franz Grundheber as Moses,  as Aron, and the SWR Sinfonieorchester conducted by Cambreling. A review noted that the choir was highly expressive (hochexpressiv) in its important dramatic function where the choir is not a commentator as in ancient Greek drama, but an actor (dramatischer Handlungsträger). The recording was nominated for the Grammy of 2015 in the category Best Opera Recording.

c. 15131 March 1546) was a Scottish Protestant Reformer and one of the early Protestant martyrs burned at the stake as a heretic.

George Wishart was the son of James and brother of Sir John of Pitarrow, both ranking themselves on the side of the Reformers. He was educated at the University of Aberdeen, then recently founded, and travelled afterwards on the Continent. It is thought that it was while he was abroad that he first turned attention to the study of the Reformed doctrines. He engaged for some time in teaching Greek at Montrose. Wishart afterwards proceeded to Cambridge and resided there for about six years, from 1538 to 1543. He returned to Scotland in the train of the Commissioners who had been appointed to arrange a marriage with Prince Edward and the Queen of Scots. He preached to the people with much acceptance at Montrose, Dundee, and throughout Ayrshire. On passing East to the Lothians, Wishart, who spoke latterly as in near prospect of death, was apprehended by Bothwell in the house of Cockburn, of Ormiston. He was carried captive to St. Andrews, where he was tried by a clerical Assembly, found guilty, and condemned as an obstinate heretic. The following day he was executed at the stake on Castle Green, his persecutor, Cardinal David Beaton or Bethune, looking on the scene from the windows of the castle, where he himself would be assassinated within three months.

Life
He belonged to a younger branch of the Wisharts of Pitarrow near Fordoun, Kincardineshire. His mother was Elizabeth, sister of Sir James Learmonth, married James Wishart of Pitarrow in April 1512. He was probably called George after his maternal grandfather of granduncle Prior George Leirmont, the name was certainly derived from his mother's family. George's father, James Wishart, died in May 1525, therefore, his mother, Elizabeth together with her brother, Sir James Learmonth of Balcomie, were the two people who were responsible for George's upbringing. Some have suggested that he may have graduated M.A., probably at King's College, Aberdeen, though others, including Wishart biographer Rev. Charles Rogers says that his name does not occur on the records of any Scottish college.  He was certainly a student at the University of Leuven, from which he graduated in 1531. Around this time he translated the First Helvetic Confession into English from the Latin. He taught the New Testament in Greek as schoolmaster at Montrose in Angus, until investigated for heresy by the Bishop of Brechin in 1538. He fled to England, where a similar charge was brought against him at Bristol in the following year by Thomas Cromwell. Under examination by Archbishop Thomas Cranmer he recanted some utterances. In 1539 or 1540 he may have visited Germany and Switzerland, but by 1542 he had entered Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, where he studied and taught.

In 1543 he returned to Scotland, in the train of a Scottish embassy which had come to London to consider the treaty of marriage between Prince Edward (later Edward VI of England) and the infant Mary, Queen of Scots. He returned to Montrose, where again he taught Scripture.

He may have been the ""Scottish man called Wishart"" acting as a messenger to England for Alexander Crichton of Brunstane in a 1544 plot against Cardinal David Beaton. Some historians such as Alphons Bellesheim and Richard Watson Dixon have accepted this identification; others are sceptical. Other possibilities include a George Wishart, Baillie of Dundee, who allied himself with Beaton's murderers; and Sir John Wishart (died 1576), afterwards a Scottish judge.

His career as an itinerant preacher began in 1544, from when he traveled Scotland from east to west. The story has been told by his disciple John Knox. He went from place to place, in danger of his life, denouncing the errors of the Papacy and the abuses in the churches of Montrose, Dundee (where he escaped an attempt on his life), Ayr, Perth, Edinburgh, Leith, Haddington (where Knox accompanied him) and elsewhere.

At Ormiston in East Lothian, in January 1546, he was seized by Lord Bothwell on the orders of Cardinal Beaton, taken to Elphinstone Castle, and transferred by order of the privy council to Edinburgh castle on 19 January 1546. Thence he was handed over to Beaton, who had a ""show trial"", with John Lauder prosecuting Wishart. He was hanged on a gibbet and his body burned at St Andrews on 1 March 1546. Foxe and Knox attribute to him a prophecy of the death of the Cardinal, who was assassinated on 29 May following, partly in revenge for Wishart's death.

Wishart's preaching in 1544–45 helped popularise the teachings of Calvin and Zwingli in Scotland. He translated into English the first Helvetic Confession of Faith in 1536. At his trial he refused to accept that confession was a sacrament, denied free will, recognised the priesthood of all believing Christians, and rejected the notion that the infinite God could be ""comprehended in one place"" between ""the priest's hands"". He proclaimed that the true Church was where the Word of God was faithfully preached and the two dominical sacraments rightly administered.

Memorials
The Martyrs Memorial at St Andrews was erected to the honour of George Wishart, Patrick Hamilton, and other martyrs of the Reformation era.

Dundee's East Port (also known as Cowgate Port), the remains of a gateway in the town's walls, is known as the Wishart Arch. The Arch is the only surviving portion of the town's walls, and probably survived owing to a story that George Wishart preached from it in 1544 to plague victims. However this story has been described as 'probably-mythical' and the structure is thought to have been built around 1590, long after Wishart's death. Wishart was also commemorated in Dundee with a United Presbyterian church being named after him. Wishart  church was built in Dundee' Cowgate in 1841 and could seat over 700 people. It was this church that the missionary Mary Slessor was a member of when she lived in Dundee. It was renamed Wishart Memorial Church in 1901, a year after it had become part of the United Free Church of Scotland, and 1929 became part of the Church of Scotland. In 1975 the church congregation was united with Dundee church and the building was sold to Dundee Cyrenians who turned it into a hostel for people with alcohol problems called the Wishart Centre. There is a house at Saint Kentigern College in Auckland, New Zealand, named after him. A lodge of the Scottish Orange Order, formed with a warrant in Dundee but often meeting in near by Forfar, is named The Wishart Arch Defenders in his honour.

169,"['Originally , the highway , followinged its present alignment , serve as a spur route off of what is now SR \xa0 568 serving the village of Vanlue .']","State Route 330 (SR 330) is a north–south state highway in the northwestern portion of the U.S. state of Ohio.  The southern terminus of SR 330 is at a diamond interchange with the SR 15 expressway just south of the village limits of Vanlue.  Its northern terminus is at SR 568 nearly  north of Vanlue.

This two-lane state route was created in the early 1930s, generally along its present routing.  From the late 1930s until the middle of the 1960s, SR 330 continued further north along present-day County Road 330 (CR 330) to SR 12 near Arcadia.  At the end of that time frame, the highway was restored to its original, shorter routing whose primary function was to serve the community of Vanlue.

Route description

SR 330 is situated entirely within the eastern half of Hancock County.  The highway begins at a diamond interchange with the SR 15 expressway in Amanda Township, picking up where CR 197 leaves off.  The highway briefly travels to the northeast amidst farmland before entering Vanlue.  SR 330 follows Buffalo Street into the village, passing amidst some commercial businesses as it enters into the downtown of the village.  SR 330 turns southeast onto Main Street, and goes through a residential neighborhood before reaching the East Street intersection, which is located adjacent to Vanlue High School.  The state route turns north onto East Street, and passes amidst a few more residences prior to departing the village and re-entering Amanda Township.  The remainder of the highway travels among a landscape of vast farmland, with a few homes appearing here and there.  SR 330 travels due north, then follows a slight reverse curve that takes it to the northwest before resuming a northerly trek.  Amidst that curve, it enters Biglick Township.  SR 330 comes to an end at its junction with SR 568.  Continuing north following the end of the state route is CR 330.

This highway is not included as a component of the National Highway System, a network of highways identified as being most important for the economy, mobility and defense of the country.

History
The SR 330 designation was assigned in 1932.  Originally, the highway, following its present alignment, served as a spur route off of what is now SR 568 serving the village of Vanlue.  At the time, SR 568 was designated as a portion of SR 15.

Five years after its assignment, SR 330 was extended north from its present northern terminus along the routing of CR 330 to a new endpoint at SR 12 approximately  north of Arcadia.  By 1965, SR 330's northern terminus was re-instated to its original location when the entirety of the 1937 extension was deleted from the state highway system.  With jurisdiction of this portion of roadway transferred to Hancock County, the road was now identified as CR 330.  Meanwhile, this was also the year when the SR 15 designation was transferred to a new four-lane expressway that was constructed in parallel to the south of its original two-lane alignment between Findlay and Carey, passing just to the south of Vanlue.  Consequently, the route intersecting SR 330 at its northern terminus was now designated as SR 568.  At the same time, SR 330 was extended slightly to the south of its former southern terminus in Vanlue to a new endpoint at a diamond interchange with the new SR 15 expressway.

Biography

Early life 
Born in colonial Taiwan, he graduated from what today is Taipei Municipal Jianguo High School and afterwards enrolled at Taipei Higher Commercial School, which today is National Taiwan University. Ishibashi was conscripted in 1944 and later reached the rank of apprentice officer by the end of World War II. 

In 1947, he formed a labor union for the ""labor service corps"" of the American occupation of Japan and was its general secretary.

Political career 
He began his political life as a member of the Nagasaki Prefectural Assembly, being elected in 1951. He was elected to the House of Representatives (Japan) for the first time in 1955, running from Nagasaki 2nd district for the Leftist Socialist Party of Japan. In 1966, Ishibashi advocated for the ""unarmed neutrality"" policy, in which the Japan Self-Defense Forces would be reorganised into a national police force and gradually reduced until an unarmed and diplomatically neutral state can be achieved. 

Only a few months preceding the 1983 general elections, Ishibashi assumed the role of chairman for the Japan Socialist Party (JSP). Ishibashi and the JSP cooperated with other opposition parties and moderated their party platform a bit to the right. As a result, the JSP weathered the 1983 elections fairly well and saw its long-running decline in fortunes slow down. In 1984, Ishibashi became the first ever serving chairman of the JSP to visit the United States, calling on Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger during Ishibashi's stay in Washington, D.C. Ishibashi also visited North Korea for five days and had talks with Kim Il-sung in late September 1984.

In 1986, under Ishibashi's tenure, the JSP adopted a new program entitled the ""New Declaration of the Japan Socialist Party"" which saw the party shift in a direction closer to western-style social democratic parties. Unfortunately for Ishibashi, this program did not convince voters that meaningful reform would come from the JSP (as opposed to mavericks within the LDP such as Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone), and as a result the JSP lost 27 seats in the 1986 general elections, and also saw its popular vote fall by 2.26% compared to the previous 1983 election. As is normal in Japanese politics, Ishibashi resigned from his position as chairman following this crushing defeat.

Later life 
In later years, he acted as an advisor for JSP chairwoman Takako Doi in strengthening cooperation with centrist parties. Ishibashi's reputation as an inter-party compromiser was seen in the fact that he refused to go along with chairwoman Doi's request that Ishibashi help campaign for an ambitious 180 candidates being fielded by the JSP for the 1990 general election, as this would involve hurting the electoral prospects of centrist allies. The same year as that election, Ishibashi retired from the political world.

After retiring, he turned to memoir writing. In 1994, he was offered the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun, but he declined. For the next decade, he turned down similar awards which came every year. Ishibashi died at a Fukuoka hospital in 2019 as a result of old age.

""']","Tulsi Gowda is an Indian environmentalist from Honnali village, Ankola taluk in Karnataka state. She has planted more than 30,000 saplings and looks after the nurseries of the Forest Department. Her work has been honoured by the Government of India and other organisations. In 2021, the Government of India awarded her the Padma Shri, the country's fourth highest civilian award. She is known as the ""Encyclopedia of the Forest"" for her ability to recognise the mother tree of any species of tree.

Early life 
Tulsi Gowda was born in 1944 into the Halakki tribal family within the Honnalli village, a settlement transitioning between rural and urban within the Uttara Kannada district in the Indian state of Karnataka. Karnataka is a state in South India known for its eco-tourism, with over twenty-five wildlife sanctuaries and five national parks.

Gowda was born into an impoverished family, and her father died when she was 2 years old, so she had to work alongside her mother as a day labourer at a local nursery once she was old enough. She did not receive a formal education or learn to read. At a young age, she was married off to an older man named Govinde Gowda. She does not know her exact age when the marriage began, though she was estimated to be around 10 to 12 years old. Her husband died when she was in her 50s.

At the nursery, Gowda was responsible for taking care of the seeds that were to be grown and harvested at the Karnataka Forestry Department, and specifically for seeds intended as a part of the Agasur seedbed. Gowda continued working at the nursery alongside her mother as a daily wage worker for 35 years until she was offered a permanent position in recognition of her work towards conservation, and her knowledge of botany. She worked at the nursery in this permanent position for 15 years before retiring at the age of seventy. During her time at the nursery, she contributed and worked directly on the afforestation efforts of the forest department by using traditional knowledge of the land. As well as planting saplings, she worked to prevent poachers and forest fires from destroying the wildlife.

Career and awards 

Gowda spent over sixty years working at the Karnataka Forest Department. This is made up of one community reserve, five tiger reserves, fifteen conservation reserves and thirty wildlife sanctuaries. It describes its aim as reconnecting communities and villages with nature, working towards a future where one-third of the area of the state has forest or tree cover.

In 1986, Gowda received the Indira Priyadarshini Vrikshamitra Award, also known as the IPVM award. The IPVM award recognizes pioneering contributions made by individuals or institutions to afforestation and wasteland development.

In 1999, Gowda received the Karnataka Rajyotsava Award, sometimes known as the Kannada Rayjotsava Award, the ""second highest civilian honour of the Karnataka state of India"". It is given yearly to distinguished citizens of Karnataka State aged over sixty.

On November 8, 2020, the Government of India awardeed Gowda the Padma Shri award, the fourth highest award given to citizens of India. The Padma Shri, also commonly spelled as Padma Shree, is an award given every year on India's Republic Day by the Government of India. Gowda said that, while she is glad to have received the Padma Shri, she ""values the forests and trees more"".

Knowledge 
Gowda is known by environmentalists as the ""Encyclopedia of the Forest"" and by her tribe as the ""tree goddess"" because of her knowledge of the forest and its plants. She is known for her ability to identify the mother tree of every species of tree in the forest no matter where it is. Mother trees are significant because of their age and size, which make them the most connected nodes in the forest. These underground nodes are used to connect mother trees with saplings and seedlings as the mother tree exchanges nitrogen and nutrients. Gowda is also an expert in seed collecting, the extraction of seeds from mother trees in order to regenerate and regrow entire plant species. It is a difficult process as the seeds must be collected at the peak of germination from the mother tree in order to ensure the survival of the seedlings and Gowda is able to work out this exact time.

Gowda cannot explain how she gathered her knowledge of the forest, but says it is as if she can ""speak the language of the forest."" In the traditions of her tribe, the Halakki Vokkaliga, the matriarchy is connected to nature and cares for the land.

Legacy 
Gowda is estimated to have planted in the range of one lakh (100,000) trees in Karnataka on her own. These contributions have made a lasting impact on the members of her community as well. Nagaraja Gowda of Uttara Kannada District, who works for the welfare of the Halakki tribe, says Gowda is the pride of their community: ""she has invaluable knowledge of the forest and medicinal plants. Nobody has documented it and she is not a good communicator, so it is difficult to understand her contribution unless you've seen her work.""

Yellappa Reddy, a retired officer, also commends Gowda's lasting commitment to her community, citing the fact that Gowda has planted and identified over 300 medicinal plants that have since been used to treat ailments within their village.

Although Gowda has retired from the Karnataka Forestry Department, she continues to teach the children of her village about the importance of the forest as well as how to find and care for seeds.

Gowda has also championed women's rights within her village. When another Halakki woman was threatened with a gun after an altercation, Gowda came to her aid stating that she will ""protest fiercely if the perpetrator of the crime isn't punished.""

Early years

Adrien-Jean-Pierre Thilorier was born in Paris, France, on 16 February 1790.  He was the son of a lawyer, Jean-Charles Thilorier (1756-1818).  Jean-Charles achieved some notoriety:  In 1786, he served as defense attorney to Count Alessandro di Cagliostro in the ""Affair of the Queen's Necklace"".  In this affair, a French cardinal (the Cardinal de Rohan) tried to ingratiate himself with the queen of France (Marie Antoinette) by buying for her—through intermediaries—a diamond necklace.  However, the intermediaries proved to be con men who defrauded the cardinal and the jewelers.  Count Cagliostro was suspected of being involved in the fraud and was arrested, but Thilorier won a verdict of not guilty. Jean-Charles was also interested in science and mechanics:  He invented a radeau-plongeur (diving wheel) to allow vehicles to cross rivers.  In 1800, he designed a poêle fumivore (smoke-eating stove; i.e., smokeless stove).  In 1803, he published a pamphlet on meteorites, in 1812, he published a pamphlet on comets, and in 1815, he published a four-volume work on science.

Nothing is known about where Adrien Thilorier received his scientific education, although his father obviously was interested in the subject.  Adrien may have been trained as a lawyer.

Mention of Thilorier's technical work first appeared in 1826:  he developed and patented a ""hydrostatic lamp"" for lighthouses.  As the lamp burned and consumed its oil, a dense aqueous solution of zinc sulfate flowed from the solution's reservoir into the oil reservoir, displacing the oil and thereby maintaining a steady flow of oil to the lamp's wick.

By 1828, competing versions of Thilorier's lamp had appeared on the market, and Thilorier was upset by what he regarded as patent infringement. (Thilorier's lamp was a refinement of similar ""hydrostatic lamps"", which had been patented by the Girard brothers on 15 December 1804 and by Mr. Verzy on 8 March 1810.)  Thilorier asked the French Academy of Sciences to investigate the matter, which they did; but Thilorier didn't receive much satisfaction as the Academy simply stated that the lamps of Thilorier and his competitors were all better than those of the Girard brothers.  Nevertheless, Thilorier continued to patent improvements to his lamp in 1828 and 1832 and in 1835.  In 1835, Thilorier, with Mr. Serrurot (a lamp maker), received a patent for an improved lamp, which was called a lampe-autostatique.  In 1837, Thilorier, with Mssrs. Serrurot and Sorel, received a patent for an apparatus that heated liquids by using thermal expansion of the liquid and a siphon to circulate liquids between a heater and a holding tank.

Thilorier's compressor

By 1829, Adrien Thilorier had developed a machine for compressing gases.  A wealthy French aristocrat, Baron Montyon (1733-1820), had endowed a set of prizes, which were awarded annually by the French Academy.  One of the prizes was for mechanical improvements.  Thilorier entered his compressor in the competition and won the Montyon prize of 1829–1,500 francs.  The compressor consisted of three cylinders: the largest cylinder had a diameter of 7.5 cm and the piston in it had a stroke of 14.6 cm; the intermediate cylinder had a diameter of 2.25 cm and its piston had a stroke of 14.6 cm; the smallest cylinder had a diameter of 0.6 cm and its piston had a stroke of 24.7 cm.  The compressor was powered by a rocker arm, which in turn was powered by a team of ten men.  The largest and intermediate cylinders were positioned symmetrically on opposite sides of the rocker arm's axis; the smallest cylinder was placed on the same side of the axis as the intermediate cylinder but twice as far from the rocker arm's axis. During one half of each cycle of the rocker arm, each piston would compress the gas within its cylinder; during the next half cycle, the gas would be transferred (presumably through a check valve) to the next cylinder, to be compressed further.  The compressor was capable of producing a pressure of 1,000 atmospheres.

Thilorier subsequently made several improvements to his compressor.  One problem with his original compressor was that the effort that was required to compress the gas was greatest at the bottom of the piston's stroke, at which point the gas's pressure was greatest.  Thilorier solved this problem by using a fusée, a device that watch makers used to allow a watch's mainspring to exert a constant torque as the mainspring unwound and its force became weaker.  Thilorier reversed the function of the fusée:  in his compressor, the fusée allowed a constant force that was supplied by the compressor's source of power (men) to be converted into a force that increased as the piston neared the bottom of its stroke.  Thanks to this modification, one man could now power the compressor instead of the ten men that had been required earlier.  He also changed the method of cooling the compressor, and he reduced the number of cylinders from three to two.  He obtained a patent for this improved compressor.

Thilorier entered his improved compressor in the competition for the Montyon prize of 1830—and again won the prize for mechanical improvements (700 francs).  He foresaw several uses for the products of his compressor:  Initially he thought that compressed air could power a cannon. However, he later suggested that compressed air could be used to provide a portable source of air for undersea divers (such as Paul Lemaire d'Angerville), to carbonate soda water, to force oils and syrups through filters, to serve as the fluid in a hydraulic press, or to power a vehicle or even a submarine.

In 1832, Thilorier won the Montyon prize for mechanical improvements yet again, after submitting a ""hydrostatic vacuum pump"".  It was a type of mercury pump:  mercury flowed through a tube to which was joined a tube from the vessel that was to be evacuated; the flow of mercury trapped bubbles of air from the vessel and then transported the bubbles away from the vessel.  Thilorier was awarded 300 francs.

In 1832, French government documents list Thilorier as an employee of the French Post Office, residing in Paris at no. 21 Place Vendôme.

Apparatus for producing liquid carbon dioxide

In 1834, Thilorier sent the French Academy of Sciences a letter in which he described experiments with liquid carbon dioxide, which had been produced by a new apparatus, by means of which "" … he obtained, by chemical means, and in a few moments, a liter of liquefied carbonic acid [i.e., carbon dioxide].""

Thilorier's original apparatus for liquefying carbon dioxide used tanks made of cast iron.  However, cast iron is brittle and so there was a danger that such a tank might rupture under pressure.  The apparatus could be dangerous:  On 30 December 1840, Osmin Hervy, who prepared scientific demonstrations for lectures at the School of Pharmacy in Paris, was operating one of Thilorier's machines when the gas-generating cylinder exploded.  Shrapnel broke Hervy's legs, one of which had to be amputated; he died of infection a few days later.  To reduce the danger of explosion, the cast iron was replaced with wrought iron.

By 1845, the Belgian chemists Daniel-Joseph-Benoît Mareska (1803-1858) and François-Marie-Louis Donny (1822-1896) had replaced the iron with copper and lead.  A description of the apparatus and its operation was provided by the French chemist Charles-Adolphe Wurtz:

The apparatus is composed of a generator and a receptacle; the generator is a cylindrical lead boiler, covered with red copper and reinforced with pieces of forged iron.  The capacity of this boiler is 6-7 liters.  The generator is suspended between the two points of a cast iron base.  The receptacle is formed from a vessel of lead contained in a cylinder of copper surrounded by rings of iron.  The opening of the generator is sealed by a screw cap, pierced along its [i.e., the cap's] axis and fitted with a valve.  The receptacle likewise bears an opening on its upper edge; one inserts in this opening a copper tube which descends almost to the bottom of the receptacle and which is fitted on the outside with a valve.  One establishes a connection between the receptacle and the generator by means of a copper tube.  In order to produce carbonic acid, one introduces into the generator 1,800 grams of sodium bicarbonate, 4½ liters of water at about 35° [C, 95°F], and a cylindrical copper cup containing 1 kilogram of concentrated sulfuric acid; one places it [i.e., the copper cup] along the axis of the generator, one closes it [i.e., the generator] and one rocks it around its axis [i.e., the two points of support of the cast iron base], in a way that the acid flows and reacts with the bicarbonate; at the end of ten minutes one opens the valves in order to allow the carbonic acid to pass into the receptacle.  The acid distills by virtue of the difference in temperature that exists between the two parts of the apparatus; one proceeds to a new preparation of carbonic acid that one allows to pass in the same way into the receptacle; by repeating [this procedure] five or six times, one can accumulate up to 2 liters of liquid [carbonic acid].

Thilorier was not the first person to liquefy carbon dioxide:  Michael Faraday had liquefied it in 1823.  However, with an ample and reliable supply of liquid carbon dioxide, Thilorier was able to observe and measure its properties, such as its vapor density and its extraordinary rate of expansion with temperature, under a wide range of conditions.

First production of ""dry ice""

At the 12 October 1835 meeting of the French Academy of Sciences, a letter from Adrien Thilorier was read in which he stated that he had solidified carbon dioxide:

Original:  Si l'on dirige un jet d'acide carbonique dans l'intérieur d'une petite fiole de verre, elle se remplit promptement, et presque en entier, d'une matièr blanche, pulvérulente, floconneuse, qui adhère fortement aux parois, et qu'on ne peut retirer qu'en brisant la bouteille.

Translation:  If one directs a jet of [liquid] carbonic acid [i.e., carbon dioxide] into the interior of a small glass vial, it quickly fills, and almost completely, with a material [that is] white, powdery, fluffy, which adheres strongly to the walls [of the vial], and which one can remove only by breaking the bottle.

What is particularly interesting about Thilorier's discovery of dry ice is that he did not realize that he had solidified carbon dioxide until a group of scientists from the French Academy of Sciences explained to him what he had accomplished:

Original:  M. Thénard fait remarquer que M. Thilorier n'avait pas encore imaginé, au moment de la visite des commissaires de l'Académie, que la substance blanchâtre obtenue par lui fût de l'acide carbonique solide.  Ce fait, dit-il, a été reconnue et constaté par la commission:  c'est elle qui a soumis l'acide à la plupart des expériences citées par l'auteur.

Translation:  Mr. Thénard [i.e., French chemist Louis Jacques Thénard (1777 – 1857)] noted that Mr. Thilorier had still not imagined, at the time of the visit of commissioners of the Academy, that the whitish substance obtained by him was solid carbonic acid.  This fact, he says, was recognized and noted by the committee: it is they who submitted the acid to most of the experiments cited by the author [i.e., Thilorier].

Thilorier thought that the liquid carbon dioxide had caused water vapor in the air to freeze on the vial; he was puzzled when the ""snow"" sublimated instead of melting.

Thilorier reported to the French Academy of Sciences the properties of solid carbon dioxide.  News of Thilorier's achievement was published not only within France but in Germany, Britain, and the United States.

The French positivist Auguste Comte was so impressed by Thilorier's investigations of gases that he devoted the twentieth day of the ninth month of his positivist calendar to British chemist John Dalton—and to Thilorier.

When dry ice was mixed with diethyl ether, it was called ""Thilorier's mixture"", presumably since Thilorier had noted in 1835 that a mixture of liquid carbon dioxide and ether produced extreme cold when sprayed on objects. It was subsequently found that under reduced pressure, temperatures as low as −110 °C could be maintained.  These mixtures (""dry ice baths"") could thus be used to maintain low temperatures during experiments.

Mistaken identification

Unfortunately, in almost all of his technical articles, Adrien Thilorier gave his name simply as ""Thilorier""; similarly, whenever others referred to him in technical articles, his name was also given only as ""Thilorier"".  This impeded efforts by scholars to identify him subsequently.  The confusion was compounded when Paul Thénard wrote a biography of his father, Louis Thénard, the chemist who explained to Thilorier in 1835 that his ""snow"" was actually solidified carbon dioxide.  In a footnote of that biography, Paul Thénard identified the ""Thilorier"" who discovered dry ice as ""Charles-Saint-Ange Thilorier"", a student at the École polytechnique in the class of 1815.  This (mistaken) identification was mentioned by Duane H. D. Roller, a graduate student at Harvard University, in a paper that was published in 1952.  Consequently, many sources claim that Charles-Saint-Ange Thilorier discovered dry ice.

During the 1960s, Madeleine Ambrière-Fargeaud, a scholar in France, was trying to identify the person who served as the model for a ""mad scientist"" character, Balthazar Claës, in Honoré de Balzac's novel La Recherche de l’absolu (The Quest of the Absolute).  Her research suggested that Claës was inspired (in part) by Adrien-Jean-Pierre Thilorier.  By 2003, Joost Mertens, a Dutch historian of science, had verified many of the findings that Ms. Ambrière-Fargeaud had made about Thilorier.

That ""Thilorier"" is actually Adrien-Jean-Pierre Thilorier is proved by French government documents, especially patents.  His 1826 patent for a hydrostatic lamp lists his name as ""Thilorier (Adrien-Jean-Pierre)"" of Paris.  His 1831 patent for a gas compressor also lists his name as ""Thilorier (Adrien-Jean-Pierre)"" and describes him as an employee of the ""Administration des postes"" (i.e., the Post Office) in Paris.  In 1832, the Bulletin of the laws of the kingdom of France also lists him as ""Thilorier (Adrien-Jean-Pierre)"" and as an employee of the Post Office, who resided at number 21 on the Place Vendôme in Paris, and as the inventor of a gas compressor.  In 1835, the government bulletin La France industrielle lists him as ""Thilorier (Adrien-Jean-Pierre)"" residing at no. 4 on rue de Bouloi in Paris and as the recipient of a patent for a hydrostatic lamp.  In 1836, The London Journal of Arts and Sciences; and Repertory of Patent Inventions lists him by his full name as the recipient of a patent for a hydrostatic lamp.

After Neželski was found guilty, convicted and given 15 years imprisonment, he was subsequently released in 2013 after serving out the entirety of his sentence.

Early life
Neželski was born in 1951. In his youth, he was employed on fishing boats and traveled around various sea ports, before changing professions to work in a plywood and furniture factory. While employed at the factory, Neželski, who had a lifelong interest in firearms, manufactured himself a pistol which he would later use in the killings. Around this time, he married a local woman, but the couple soon divorced, with his ex-wife describing Neželski as a religious fanatic who attended the Alexander Nevsky Cathedral every morning so he could pray to God. After their divorce, Neželski began working as a security guard at a shop in Priisle, but also served as a druzhinnik whenever possible.

Murders and flight
As his financial situation gradually started to worsen, Neželski decided that he should turn to robberies to survive, using his experience as a druzhinnik and knowledge of police procedures to avoid getting caught. On June 27, 1994, he went to his ex-wife's home on Baltic Sea Road in Lasnamäe and broke inside. There, he threw out her new boyfriend, 26-year-old Gennadi, who was visiting at the time. When Gennadi attempted to get back inside, Neželski grabbed his self made pistol and killed him on the spot.

On August 31st, 1994, Neželski attempted to rob the Antonius bureau de change on Luise Street, but was met with resistance from the head manager, 31-year-old Jüri. The two men exchanged gunfire, with Anatoli suffering injuries to the leg and Jüri being killed on the spot with two revolver shots. Neželski was unable to steal any money from the venue, as he was forced to flee from the crime scene.

The final crime occurred two years later, on March 7, 1996. On that day, Neželski entered the main building of the Hansabank on Liivalaia Street, and attempted to extort the 48-year-old Rita, an accountant for AS Pesutehnika, for all her money. When the woman retaliated, she was shot with a Chinese-manufactured TT pistol which her killer had recently bought from a market. He then stole a bag containing a total of 49,000 krooni and went into hiding, first staying with an acquaintance on Nisu Street, whom he repaid by repairing his apartment, using the stolen money to pay off his debts and living expenses. Over the next two years, Neželski avoided capture by constantly changing his hideouts and stealing food from stores in order to survive.

Imprisonment and release
On the morning of March 17, 1998, Anatoli Neželski was detained on Kauba Street while collecting bottles. Shortly after his capture, Neželski readily confessed to all of his crimes, indicating how, why and where he had committed the respective killings. He was convicted and sentenced to 15 years imprisonment for all three crimes, in addition to being required to pay 70,000 krooni in damages to the victims' family members. The reason for his relatively short sentence was due to a loophole in Estonian law at the time: in 1994, the harshest penalty available was the death penalty and there were no life sentences, and the longest available being the 15 year-sentence. When he was captured in 1998, the death penalty had been abolished and the highest available penalty he could be given is the 15-year sentence.

In 2009, after 11 years behind bars, Neželski applied for early release, citing that he is repentant about his wrongdoings and wanted to live and work to redeem himself. In 2012, Neželski withdrew his requests for early release from the Harju County Court, as his sentence was nearing its completion by that time. In March 2013, he was released from prison, and now lives freely in Tallinn.

""Pete"" Jubeck (February 9, 1936–May 12, 2003) was a Czech-American businessman who founded, with partner Robert Swartz, the restaurants Sir Pizza of Michigan and Clara's Lansing Station, both in Lansing, Michigan, and with partner Ross Simpson, Clara's on the River in Battle Creek, Michigan.

Biography

Early life
Jubeck was born to parents of Czech origin in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 1936. He served with the United States Air Force, North Sea, West Germany with the Air Force Security Service as a Radio Intercept Operator in the 1950s. Jubeck went to Ball State University in Muncie, Indiana, on a football scholarship attaining Bachelor of Arts; Physical Education and Social Science.

Career highlights

Pizza King and Sir Pizza
Beginning in 1962, and while attending Ball State, Jubeck worked at Pizza King, a local pizza eatery owned by the Swartz family. Robert W. (Bob) Swartz, worked in his mom and dad's pizza place, located in Muncie, Indiana. With an engineering degree and a passion for details, Bob was able to help his mom and dad develop a cup system that was easy to follow and produced quality results on a consistent basis. The location was expanded five times. They received numerous requests from people to buy their recipes, systems, and techniques. Instead of selling them, the Swartzes decided to franchise their operation under the name of Sir Pizza, which was incorporated in 1965.

Together with Bob Swartz, Jubeck developed the State Franchise Division of the company. Sir Pizza branched out through franchise locations in several states, including Kentucky, Tennessee, Florida, Ohio, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania, as well as locations abroad through Sir Pizza International. (Sir Pizza International now has over 200 franchises in operation in the United States, and abroad. In 1992 Sir Pizza broke into the top twenty list of ""Pizza Today's"" best 200 franchises).''

In 2015, Sir Pizza was named the official training food of the Ironman Competition.

Jubeck then partnered with Swartz as co-owner Sir Pizza of Michigan in 1966, opening their first Sir Pizza restaurant on Kalamazoo Street in Lansing, Michigan. Sir Pizza of Michigan is a licensee of Pizza King of Muncie, Indiana. Each of Jubeck's three brothers (Charles, Barry, and Tom) and his sister (Marcie) became associated with Sir Pizza thereafter. By 1975, Sir Pizza of Michigan had grown to eight company owned locations, eight franchise locations, and a central commissary, all in the Lansing area.

Clara's restaurants
In 1978, Jubeck chose the old Union Depot (Lansing, Michigan) built in 1903 as the site of his new venture Clara's Lansing Station,  which opened in the summer of 1979 bringing life back into the once proud structure.  The name ""Clara's"" was chosen because it was a popular name at the turn of the 20th century, and because it was the name of Swartz's mother. This new restaurant location, designed and developed by Peter himself, was much larger than his pizza restaurants, touting a seating capacity of over 200 guests. Clara’s menu was larger too, offering steaks, seafood, hamburgers and salads in addition to Sir Pizza’s fare. The décor displayed turn of the century memorabilia from around the state. Clara’s quickly became a local favorite.

In 1980, Jubeck hired Ross Simpson as General Manager to help further develop the concept and menu, and to handle operations of the restaurant. Simpson added more entrées to the menu, including ""Chicken Hawaiian"", Clara's biggest seller. Simpson left Clara's in 1982 to join the T.G.I. Friday's restaurant chain, but returned to Clara's as Director of Operations in 1989. About this time, Jubeck ended his partnership with Swartz and separated Clara’s operations from those of Sir Pizza in order to focus his efforts towards refining and expanding Clara’s concept. In 1991, Sir Pizza of Michigan was sold to Peter's brother Charles Jubeck, who was previously associated with Sir Pizza in Kentucky. Charles has since sold Sir Pizza of Michigan to another partnership.

Shortly after his return, Simpson expanded Clara's entree menu to sixteen pages, added an award winning Sunday Brunch, and outdoor patio dining. This period resulted in substantial sales growth, which allowed Jubeck to undertake an expansion of the Lansing restaurant. The subsequent addition of a restored 1910 Pullman Dining car to allow seating for 60 additional guests was completed in early 1999.

Early in 1991, Jubeck and Simpson purchased and restored the Michigan Central Railroad Depot (Battle Creek, Michigan) built in 1888 and, on June 8, 1992 opened Clara's on the River restaurant with a seating capacity of 300 guests.  It offered the same food and beverage items as Clara's in Lansing, and emphasized the rich history of Battle Creek in the depot's decor.  Clara's on the River was an immediate success, with over 330,000 visitors its first year. In late 1998, Clara's completed the development of a twelve hundred square foot banquet room in the ""Railway Express Agency"" (REA) building located on Clara's on the River's property.

Death and personal life
Jubeck was a strong family man, member of the Michigan Restaurant Association, and of the Asbury United Methodist Church in Lansing. He was an avid racketball player and golfer. Peter Jubeck died of esophageal cancer at his home in Wacousta, Michigan, on May 12, 2003 at the age of 67. Family ownership of Clara's Lansing Station continued through his wife of 40 years, Linda, and through their two children, Scott and Cindy, who were raised while working in the family business. Linda, Scott, and Cindy operated the Lansing, Michigan location until they sold the depot to the Gillespie Group in 2016. Simpson became the sole owner of Clara's on the River upon Peter Jubeck's death, and continues to operate the Battle Creek, Michigan location.

He spent most of his career with Granada, appearing in 220 competitive games during six seasons, four in La Liga. He also played professionally in England, with Watford and West Bromwich Albion.

Born in France, Nyom has been a Cameroonian international since 2011. He represented the nation at the 2014 World Cup.

Club career

Early years, Granada
Born in Neuilly-sur-Seine, France, Nyom only played amateur football in the country, competing in the reserves championship with AS Nancy-Lorraine and appearing for AC Arles-Avignon in the Championnat National. In the summer of 2009 he was signed by Udinese Calcio from Italy, and was immediately loaned to Granada CF in Spain as part of the partnership agreement between both clubs.

Nyom quickly became an undisputed first-choice with the Andalusia side, helping them promote from Segunda División B to La Liga in just two seasons. He made his debut in the latter competition on 27 August 2011, in a 0–1 home loss against neighbours Real Betis.

Nyom renewed his contract with Udinese in late May 2013, but continued playing with Granada. He scored his first and only goal in the Spanish top flight on 25 October 2014, putting the visitors ahead in a 1–1 draw at SD Eibar.

Watford
On 14 July 2015, Nyom signed for newly promoted Premier League team Watford on a four-year contract from Udinese. He made his debut on 8 August, starting in a 2–2 draw at Everton.

West Bromwich Albion
On 31 August 2016, Nyom joined fellow Premier League team West Bromwich Albion for an undisclosed fee. After establishing himself in the starting lineup he got his first assist in a 4–0 home win against Burnley, on 22 November.

Nyom returned to the Spanish top flight in the summer of 2018, signing with CD Leganés on a season-long loan deal. He made his debut for the club on 16 September, playing 85 minutes in a 0–1 home loss against Villarreal CF. He scored his only goal for them three months later, in a 1–1 draw to Getafe CF also at Estadio Municipal de Butarque.

Getafe
On 24 July 2019, after his loan spell with Lega ended, Nyom joined Getafe on a two-year contract with an option for another – West Bromwich continued to report to FIFA asking for a £2.7million compensation. On 28 January 2022, he terminated his contract with the club.

Leganés
Nyom returned to Leganés on 28 January 2022, signing a 18-month contract.

International career

Nyom opted to represent Cameroon internationally, and earned his first cap on 11 November 2011 in a 3–1 friendly win against Sudan. He was selected by manager Volker Finke for his 2014 FIFA World Cup squad, and made his debut in the tournament on 23 June against Brazil with the ""Indomitable Lions"" already eliminated from the knockout phase after two losses. He provided the cross for Joël Matip's equalizer shortly before the 30-minute mark, but the hosts eventually won 4–1.

Now he has played 18 matches in the form of the main team of this African country.

Corr is known for his roles in  the Australian drama series Packed to the Rafters and Love Child along with film roles in Wolf Creek 2 (2013), The Water Diviner (2014) and Holding the Man (2015).

Life and career
Corr was born in Melbourne. His father is Peter Corr, the head coach of the Australian women's goalball team. He started his acting career at the age of thirteen with the film Opraholic. His first television performance was on The Sleepover Club with a supporting role as Matthew McDougal. After completing filming on The Sleepover Club, he scored a lead role as Sheng Zamett on Silversun. 
Soon after, Corr had many guest appearances on shows such as Scooter: Secret Agent, Blue Heelers and Neighbours. Corr is also a voice actor and was the voice of a sheep in Charlotte's Web. In 2006, the second series of Blue Water High aired on Australian TV in which he had a lead. Corr starred as a young surfer named Eric, who was one of the six chosen teens to attend Solar Blue. In 2009, he graduated from the National Institute of Dramatic Art (NIDA). In 2010, Corr appeared in the final few episodes of Underbelly: The Golden Mile as Michael Kanaan and was a regular character on the popular Australian television show Packed to the Rafters, playing Dave Rafter's nephew Coby Jennings.

Corr was the 2011 recipient of the Heath Ledger Scholarship. He was a nominee for Cleo's Bachelor of the Year in 2012. In 2013, he appeared in the teen thriller film 6 Plots, and starred alongside John Jarratt in Wolf Creek 2, the 2013 sequel to the horror film Wolf Creek.

In May 2014, Corr was charged with heroin possession after being found with a freezer bag holding 0.26g (less than 1/100 of an ounce) of the drug in the Sydney suburb of Bondi. After admitting to the possession, the actor was given a 12-month good behaviour bond with no conviction recorded. The arrest took place only a few days after Corr's grandfather (who flew with him when traveling to acting jobs as a child) had gone into a coma following a heart attack. In a “vulnerable state,” Corr went to the hotel, where a man gave him a bag containing heroin and said, “here, have this, you’ll feel better.” According to Corr's lawyer, Corr was grateful for having been arrested, because it stopped him from using the drug, “which he said he had never tried before.” As Corr later stated, “I found myself in a position where I was incredibly upset, someone offered me something and 200 metres after, I was picked up with it. It was an error of judgment.”

In 2015, Corr starred in Neil Armfield's romantic-drama film Holding the Man, adapted from Timothy Conigrave's 1995 memoir of the same name. Corr portrayed Timothy Conigrave opposite Craig Stott who portrayed John Caleo, with supporting performances from Guy Pearce, Anthony LaPaglia, Sarah Snook, Kerry Fox and Geoffrey Rush.

Corr stars in the television series Wanted.

In 2018, Corr appeared as Joseph in Helen Edmundson's film Mary Magdalene.

Connections with the Indian sub-continent 
In India, Declercq is a respected scientist. Given his background in astrophysics, acoustics, and acousto-optics, he was honored, in 2019, to inaugurate the Aryabhatt Auditorium. The auditorium is named after Indias mathematician-astronomer Aryabhatt. It belongs to the ""Prof. Rajendra Singh (Rajju Bhaiya) Institute of Physical Sciences for Study and Research"" at the VBSPU University at Jaunpur, which is named after Rajju Bhaiya, a pupil of Nobel Prize laureate C.V. Raman. 
In 2008 Declercq wrote a book on ultrasonics, together with his Indian colleagues P.C. Mishra, Rajendra Kumar Singh, and Sri Singh.
In Sri Lanka, a country which he visits regularly, he has family bonds and is a frequently invited speaker at the nation’s institutes of higher education.
He is also known as a scholar of the history of India and Sri Lanka.
In 2022, he was named Physics Professor Honoris Causa at the University of Allahabad, India.

Coat of arms and lineage 
 
Declercq's coat of arms consists of the following elements:

Motto: Érudit et sage à pied levé  (English: educated and wise on a raised foot)

Blazon:
on the bordure a compone of 14 pieces gold and azure of which five at the top, an azur shield, having a silver crane with raised foot, membered and beaked in red, holding in the right foot an upright feather in gold, accompanied in chief by two six-pointed stars and at the bottom a sun in gold (original blazon in French: A la bordure componnée de quatorze pièces d’or et d’azur dont cinq au chef, un écusson d’azur, a une grue d’argent sur pied, membrée et becquée de gueules, tenant de la patte dextre une plume d’oie taillée d’or posée en pal, accompagnée en chef de deux étoiles radiée de 6 pointes d’or et en ponte un soleil d'or.)

Crest: A rising silver swan with red beak (original crest in French: un cygne éployé d'argent et becquée de gueules)

Origin: The coat of arms contains colours and elements referring to that of Declercq’s ancestors de Patin (a Flemish family originating in the 14th century in Cambrai, France), with shield placed in front of the original shield (in catalan: Cortado Jaquelado de oro y azur, 2º, de azur, dos palos de oro) of his Spanish paternal ancestors Desclergues (originating in the 16th century in Catalunya, Spain).

Declercq is a patrilineal descendant of Don Pere Desclergue (I), who was born early in the 15th century AD at Montblanc in the Conca de Barberà in Catalunya, Spain. Pere Desclergue's grandson Bonaventura Desclergue (II) i Cortés, a notary at Montblanc, had four sons, one of which would stay as heir at Montblanc, while the three others (Jeroni, Antoni (I) and Enric) would go to Flanders as military during the Eighty-year war. Don Jeroni Desclergue had been a military since 1587. He stayed in Flanders from 1587-1598 and 1601-1604. In 1587, he became a commander in the infantry company of Lluís de Queralt (a Catalan); while in Flanders he joined the company of Diego de Durango, in the tercio of Luis del Villar. It has been reported that he was involved in military interventions in Holland, Flanders and France, including the Siege of Cambrai of 1595.
On March 10 of 1597 he captured, with his company, the city of Amiens and helped further defending it against the French. On January 14 of 1598 he was recognized for his military career by his captain Diego de Durango.  Once returned to Barcelona, he went to the service of the Viceroy Duke of Feria. His stay in Barcelona allowed him to attend, with his father Bonaventura Desclergue (II) and his elder brother Francesc Desclergue, in the Cortes of Barcelona of 1599.  In 1602 he returned to Flanders in August, where he commanded as Tercio captain of a company of Iñigo de Borja, with which he participated in the Siege of Ostend (August 1601 - September 27 of 1604), where he died, with half of his company, while leading an assault, as a result of the explosion of a mine, on 4 September of 1604, which also wounded his brother Enric Desclergue.  Enric was awarded for his military achievements and died in 1631. Antoni appeared in contemporary literature which shows that he went back and forth to Spain, while Jeroni’s grandson, Antoni, was the continuator of the Desclergue bloodline in Flanders through his marriage, in Flanders, with Martina Veracruz in 1656. Bonaventura Desclergues (II) is the one who established the monumental 'Casal dels Desclergue’, or ’la Casa Desclergues’ on the Plaza Mayor of Montblanc; Nico Declercq stems from Jeroni Desclergue twelve generations later. DNA analysis shows that the Desclergues of Montblanc originate from Bertrand du Guesclin, who was a military commander from Brittany and who supported Henry of Trastámara, the first King of Castile and León in the period 1365-1370.

Zichal began her career serving as a legislative director and campaign advisor to several Democratic congressional members. She then served as the Deputy Assistant to the President for Energy and Climate Change in the Barack Obama administration starting in 2009. Following the early 2011 departure of Carol Browner from the administration, Zichal was tasked with coordinating the administration's energy and climate policy and was the architect of the Clean Power Plan.

In November 2013, she left the administration and became a private consultant and a fellow at the Atlantic Council. She has served on several company boards and councils, including that of Cheniere Energy, a liquified natural gas company, and was The Nature Conservancy's vice president for corporate engagement. Since late 2020 she has been head of the wind and solar focused American Clean Power Association.

Early life and education
Zichal grew up in Elkader, Iowa. Her father worked as a family physician and her mother as a hospital administrator. She has one younger brother. Zichal graduated from Central Community School District in 1994. She attended Cook College at Rutgers University, where she studied environmental policy and graduated in 1999.

Career

Legislative assistant and campaign advisor 
While at Rutgers, she interned at the state chapter of the Sierra Club and was part of a panel interviewing candidates for New Jersey's 12th congressional district. After Democrat Rush D. Holt, Jr. defeated Republican incumbent Michael J. Pappas, in part due to support from environmentalists, Holt hired Zichal as his legislative director. She held the same position for Representative Frank Pallone from 2001 to 2002. She then was a legislative assistant and later director for U.S. Senator John Kerry from 2002 to 2008. She also worked as an assistant for the Senate Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee. In these positions she worked on legislation to address climate change, reduce the country's dependence on oil for energy, and to protect American natural resources.

Zichal also served as a top advisor on energy and environmental issues to the 2004 Kerry presidential campaign and the 2008 Obama presidential campaign. She had first met Obama when he was lost in one of the Senate buildings and asked her for directions.

Obama administration

After serving on the Obama-Biden Transition Project in its Energy and Environment Policy Working Group, she was named to be Deputy Assistant to the President for Energy and Climate Change in December 2008, to serve as deputy to Carol Browner, who was named director of the White House Office of Energy and Climate Change Policy (as such, Browner's position was also informally referred to as the ""Climate Czar"" or ""Energy Czar""). Zichal took office in January 2009. She was part of the administration response to the 2010 BP oil spill and supervised later modifications of safety standards for offshore oil and natural gas extraction.

When Browner left the White House in March 2011, Zichal took over the general responsibilities of coordinating the administration's energy and climate policy, now operating from within the U.S. Domestic Policy Council (the ""czar"" position itself having been reorganized away by the White House and its funding subsequently abolished by Congress in the mid-April 2011 federal spending agreement that averted a possible government shutdown). As such she became one of the White House staff members tasked with implementation of the Presidential Climate Action Plan. Her job also involved outreach activities towards the energy industry and environmentalists as well as dealing with Congress. With Republicans having taken over the House of Representatives following the 2010 midterm elections, chances of the large-scale climate and energy legislation passing that Browner had worked towards were essentially nil. At first the administration pursued more modest goals that could attract bipartisan support, such as reducing oil imports and promoting clean or renewable energy sources. The White House subsequently gave credit to Zichal for putting into place policy changes that would lead to a doubling of wind and solar power generation.

During the early portion of Obama's second term, Zichal was one of the public faces of the administration's approach of addressing climate change via federal regulatory action. She was the architect of a June 2013 plan to reduce greenhouse gases resulting from the nation's power plants by having the Environmental Protection Agency issue revised standards for carbon emissions from new and existing plants. They were the first ever such restrictions. (This plan eventually became known as the Clean Power Plan when issued in revised form in 2015; Zichal was still considered one of its architects. It became politically controversial during the 2016 U.S. presidential election, with opponents deriding it as the ""War on Coal"". Its implementation was blocked while challenges to it were made in U.S. federal courts.)

A 2013 profile from National Journal described her as having ""developed a reputation among players across the energy spectrum as a smart, pragmatic, and serious player."" A Democratic political operative and energy industry lobbyist called Zichal a ""skilled communicator and negotiator"" and said she was ""dogged in her pursuit of gaining consensus with external stakeholders and delivering on a clean energy agenda for this administration."" However, former Vice President and ardent environmentalist Al Gore complained in mid-2013 that the administration was not giving climate change sufficient priority, and making reference to Zichal said, ""He does not yet have a team in the White House to help him implement solutions to the climate crisis. He hasn't staffed up for it ... he's got one person who hasn't been given that much authority.""

In October 2013, Zichal announced that she would soon be stepping down from her post. She was given the chance to accept other positions within the administration, but declined. She was one of the last of Obama's 2008 campaign advisors to still be in the administration; she had been high valued inside the administration and by one report Obama had personally urged her to stay. Her last day was November 8, 2013, and she was succeeded by Dan Utech.

Consultant, board member and executive
Zichal subsequently became an independent energy consultant, working at her own firm called Zichal Inc. In January 2015 she was named a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council. There she is part of the council's Global Energy Center. She served on the board of Cheniere Energy, a liquified natural gas company, from 2014 to 2018, as well as the board of Spanish multinational-owned Abengoa Bioenergy. In addition she is an operating advisor at Broadscale, an energy-focused investing firm, and a senior advisor at an enterprise called Sensity. She joined the board of non-profit Solar Foundation and Naturevest, the conservation investing organization within the Nature Conservancy. In 2018, she became the Nature Conservancy's Vice President for corporate engagement, serving until 2019. In 2019, she was announced as the executive director of the Blue Prosperity Coalition, another conservation and climate-oriented group.

She remained active in the public debate over climate change and energy policy. During the 2016 Democratic Party presidential primaries, she supported Hillary Clinton.

In 2019, she became an advisor to the Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign, helping him craft a ""middle ground"" climate and energy policy, in contrast to the Green New Deal. Zichal said of those backing the Green New Deal, ""I respect where they are coming from. What we learned from the Obama administration is unless we find middle ground on these issues, we risk not having any policies. ... [Biden will] build a new climate coalition. Unions and environmentalists are searching for common ground. We can't drive a common agenda unless we work together."" During the presidential transition of Joe Biden there was speculation she might join the new administration, but her stint on the board of Cheniere Energy brought opposition against her from progressive organizations who were pushing against anyone being appointed to an environment-related position if they had worked in the fossil fuel industry.

Instead, in December 2020 she was named as the chief executive of the American Clean Power Association, a newly formed trade group representing companies involved in developing wind and solar energy, storage and transmission. It is the successor organization to the American Wind Energy Association.  The Biden administration's environmental policy placed an emphasis on developing wind power, such as a goal announced in October 2021 to have seven major offshore wind farms operating off U.S. coasts by 2030; Zichal said that goal was ""ambitious but achievable"" and a vital part of any plan to achieve complete carbon pollution-free electricity generation by 2035.

It was made an official Historical Monument for its Art Nouveau style.

History 

In 1787, the building hosted the restaurant Le Cheval Blanc, became one of the first café-concerts.

The current building was erected in 1901–1902 by architect Édouard Fournier. The Art Nouveau restaurant was decorated by Louis Trézel, Armand Ségau and Hippolyte Boulenger, and opened in 1903 as Gandon-Fournier. In 1924, the establishment was handed over to Julien Barbarin. Several signs representing peacocks were made by Armand Ségaud, whereas the mahogany counter is attributed to cabinetmaker Louis Majorelle. Louis Trézel depicted four women on several sintered-glass panels inspired by Alfons Muchas's iconography.

The tiled floor, which depicts a wild aquilegia and daisy meadow, was crafted in Hippolyte Boulenger's pottery works in Choisy-le-Roi, whose headquarters where located in the neighborhood of the restaurant. At Julien Barbarin's request, Georges Guenne's company installed large window panes which let the natural light pour into the room; the drawings of the windows were made by Charles Buffer, the father of painter Bernard Buffet.

In 1938, the restaurant was renamed Julien (or Chez Julien).

In 1975, the establishment was purchased by Groupe Flo led by Jean-Paul Bucher.

The restaurant was renamed Bouillon Julien in 2018.

The restaurant room was classified a Historical Monument in 1997. The front façade and the roofs were listed in the same year.

In popular culture 
Singer Édith Piaf used to wait for Marcel Cerdan at table No. 24.

It is located just north of Zijldijk, along the N46 road between the city of Groningen and the Eemshaven seaport. It had a population of around 100 in January 2017.

History
The village was first mentioned in 1448 as ""Enghelbert up den Nyen lande"", and means ""eastern new land"". Oost (east) has been added to distinguish from Westernieland. The land was reclaimed after a dike was built in 1317. The village has a terp (artificial living hill) which contains a church from the 13th century. It used to have a tower, but it was demolished in 1822, and a ridge turret was place on the church instead.

Oosternieland was home to 308 people in 1840. It was part of Uithuizermeeden municipality before 1979, when it became part of Hefshuizen. In 2019, it became part of the municipality of Het Hogeland.

She became known for her friendship with the Brazilian actress, Carmen Miranda, and for interviewing many celebrities of the time.

Early life
Dulce Damasceno de Brito was born in 1926 in Casa Branca in Brazil's São Paulo state. Even as a child, she was interested in the film world. At the age of 17, and already registered as a journalist, she bought a defunct magazine, registering it in her brother's name because she was still a minor. The magazine was short-lived, but it opened the doors to her future success.

Damasceno de Brito taught herself English. In 1952, she went to Hollywood, hired as a correspondent for the media company, Diários Associados, and for O Cruzeiro magazine, and lived there for 16 years. Her role was more that of a gossip columnist than a film critic. After a first visit to Los Angeles, Damasceno de Brito returned to Brazil in 1955 to marry her boyfriend. They had two children, with her husband staying at home in Hollywood to look after them.

Career
She became friendly with the Brazilian actress Carmen Miranda and, through her, met many other stars of the era, becoming particularly well-known for interviewing her neighbour, Marlon Brando, on three occasions, although he normally refused to do interviews. At that time interviews were usually conducted without tape recorders and journalists were required by their bosses to have their photo taken with the actor being interviewed, to prove the interview took place. Also, at that time journalists had easy access to the movie studios and Damasceno de Brito found it easy to meet and befriend many of the Hollywood celebrities. Among those she interviewed were Marilyn Monroe, Clark Gable, Elizabeth Taylor, Rock Hudson, Doris Day, Cary Grant, Marlene Dietrich, James Stewart, Charlton Heston, Audrey Hepburn, John Wayne, Jane Wyman, Sophia Loren, James Dean, Barbara Stanwyck, Gregory Peck, Walt Disney, Grace Kelly, and Elvis Presley, as well as directors such as Robert Aldrich, Cecil B. de Mille, Michael Curtiz, Orson Welles and Billy Wilder.

Critical reception
Her columns were very popular in Brazil and her work was reproduced in 20 Brazilian newspapers. Nevertheless, among the elite she was often criticised for producing work that was devoid of a critical sense and too pro-American.

Publications
Damasceno de Brito authored several books: 
1968. Hollywood, nua e crua (Hollywood Naked and Raw), Publisher: O Cruzeiro. A book that considers the loneliness of the screen idols. 
1986. O ABC de Carmen Miranda, Publisher: Companhia e Nacional 
1992. Hollywood, nua e crua – Part 2, Publisher: Best Seller 
2008. Lembranças de Hollywood (Memories of Hollywood), Publisher: Imprensa Oficial do Estado de São Paulo. Written portraits of 140 Hollywood personalities with ""their quirks and idiosyncrasies, the sexuality of one and the other, the decadence of many.""

Death
Dulce Damasceno de Brito died in São Paulo on 9 November 2008 of heart problems. She was writing newspaper columns until her death, working for SET Magazine. Interviewed at the age of 80, she stated that her one regret was that she had not interviewed more film directors, because her readers did not ask for it, being more interested in intimate details and gossip about the actors.

Sento Sé has a peculiar history. It is among the five cities that had to be flooded because of construction of the Sobradinho Dam. The new Sento Sé erected in 1974, was being gradually populated by residents of the former headquarters, which plunged into the waters.

History 
The name Sento Sé comes from an ancestral indigenous tribe called Centoce. The first foreign settlers were Portuguese sugar cane producers that built mills in that area. The foundation of the municipality was in 1832 by a provincial decree.

In the 1970s the city passed for one of the most complicated moments. The construction of Sobradinho Dam obligated the moving of the city and another little communities close to the river to another place 62 kilometers away, in 1974.

The ensuing trials of Madden and Ferriman have created a media sensation in Toronto and in the Canadian English media generally, which intensified after the first trial ended in a mistrial when a key witness was discovered to have committed perjury.

Madden and Ferriman were convicted, respectively, of first-degree murder and manslaughter in early 2006, but until September 29, 2006, when Justice David McCombs elected to sentence the youths as adults, the names of the principals in the case were precluded from publication by provisions of Canada's Youth Criminal Justice Act.

Death 
On the afternoon of November 25, 2003, Kevin Madden (then 16) was at home, accompanied by Timothy Ferriman and another friend, who remains publicly unidentified.  The three began to extensively vandalize the family home, smashing beer bottles and a television with baseball bats, while drinking wine.  Less than an hour before attacking Johnathon, who was also at home, all three spoke on the telephone to Ferriman's girlfriend indicating that a mass murder would occur; she tape-recorded this conversation.

Shortly thereafter, Kevin Madden attacked Johnathon with a butcher knife, cutting his face and neck 71 times, and severing his voice box and his carotid artery.  Though present, Ferriman did not stab Johnathon himself but encouraged Kevin and handed him the knife, and afterwards helped to move Johnathon's body.

Following Johnathon's death, the boys hid his body in a basement crawl space.  Together, the three awaited Kevin's and Johnathon's stepfather, Ralston Champagnie, who was coming home from work.  When Champagnie arrived, he was attacked with a baseball bat and knife, but managed to escape from the house.

Johnathon's body was retrieved later that evening.  All three boys were arrested within 24 hours of the incident.

Court cases

First court case 
The first court case relied on Ferriman's girlfriend as the Crown's key witness.  It ended in a mistrial after she apparently perjured herself.

She made several posts on the site vampirefreaks.com indicating an interest in vampirism, which contradicted earlier court testimony.

Second court case 
During the second case, Kevin Madden stated that ""people who did not know Johnathon should not be concerned about what happened to him"" 

The verdict for the second court case was delivered on 27 February 2006.  The jury determined that Kevin Madden was guilty of first-degree murder for his role in Johnathon's death, and guilty of attempted murder for his attack on his stepfather, Champagnie.  Ferriman was found guilty of manslaughter for assisting in Johnathon's death. The third boy, who remains unidentified, was acquitted.

In the sentencing hearing on 29 September 2006, Justice David McCombs determined that Madden and Ferriman should be sentenced as adults, which permitted their identities, and those of the rest of Madden's family, to be published for the first time.

Both Madden's and Ferriman's lawyers indicated they were displeased that their clients were not sentenced as youths.  Speaking of Madden, who had expressed no remorse or emotion in response to his actions throughout the trials, his lawyer said ""Kevin desperately needs treatment, and unfortunately he's not going to get it.  We could have had 10 years of in-depth treatment in the youth system and he's not going to get it.""  Ferriman's lawyer indicated he would appeal the decision, while Madden's lawyer said he was considering it.

In the sentencing hearing, Ferriman addressed the court and apologized for what he had done.  His remorse enabled him to serve his sentence in a youth facility.

Aftermath 
Following the release of information after the publication ban was lifted, Joanne Champagnie, mother of Johnathon and Kevin Madden, launched a website dedicated to Johnathon's memory.

Biography
Satyanarayanan was born on 5 February 1948 in Mumbai to Sushila and Vasudev Mandake. Her father was a police officer. She studied in Mumbai, Pune and Nashik, graduating from the Delhi School Board with a focus on Sanskrit. She entered the Indian Administrative Service after completing undergraduate and postgraduate degrees.

Satyanarayanan was diagnosed with COVID-19 during the COVID-19 pandemic in India in July 2020, and died at the age of 72, following complications in Mumbai, on 16 July 2020. Satyanarayanan has two children, one of whom was diagnosed with Down Syndrome, and has written about her experience of motherhood in a memoir titled, One Full, One Half.

Career 
Satyanarayanan was a member of the Indian Administrative Service, graduating in 1972 in the Maharashtra cadre. During her career as a civil servant, she held posts in the Home, Forest, and Social Welfare departments in the Maharashtra Government, and retired as the Additional Chief Secretary (Revenue) in 2009. She served as the Principal Secretary for the Shiv Sena-BJP coalition government led by Chief Minister Manohar Joshi from 1995 to 1999. She also served as the Director-General of Information and Public Relations for the Maharashtra government.

After her retirement from civil service, she was appointed as the State Election Commissioner in Maharashtra, succeeding Nand Lal, and held the position until July 2014. The 2012 local elections in Maharashtra were conducted during her tenure.

Following her retirement from civil service, Satyanarayanan lectured at the MIT Civil Services Training Institute in Pune on public administration.

Writing and Publications  
Satyanarayanan wrote extensively in Marathi, with seven novels and ten volumes of poetry published at the time of her death. She also wrote two memoirs.

Non-Fiction 
In 2005 Satyanarayanan published a memoir titled एक पूर्ण अपूर्ण  (One Full, One Half) focusing on her experience of raising a child with Down Syndrome while managing her career as a civil servant. It was translated into English and Hindi. A second memoir, जाळरेषा (Network) focused on her experiences in four decades of civil service, and Satyanarayanan donated the proceeds from the sale of this book to a non-profit organisation, founded by actor Nana Patekar, to support farmers in Maharashtra.

In addition to these, Satyanarayanan has published a number of works of non-fiction, including पुनर्भेट (Reunion) (essays and criticism) and सत्यकथा (True Legends), a religious text. Satyanarayanan drew from her work in multiple departments of the Government of Maharashtra to write several manuals, including पालकांच्या मार्गदर्शनासाठी केस स्टडीज (Case Studies for Parental Guidance), एक दिवस जीवनातला (A Day in the Life, 2015), a book on environmental conservation, drawing from her experience in the Department of Forestry of the Government of Maharashtra; क्रांतिज्योती (Krantijyoti), a guidebook for women in local government; and टाकीचे घाव (Tank Wound), an account of the conduct of local elections in Maharashtra.

Her contributions to Marathi newspapers and magazines, in the form of articles and regular columns, were also published in two compilations, आयुष्य जगताना (Living Life), and डेल्टा 15 (Delta 15).

Fiction 
Satyanarayanan wrote and published four novels:

 तुझ्याविना (Without You)
 रात्र वणव्याची (The Night Has Ended)
 ऋण (Loan)
 तिढा (Bitter)

Poetry 
Satyanarayanan has published several volumes of poetry:

 आकाश पेलताना (When The Sky Rises)
 अग्निपुष्प (Flower of Fire) 
 अमृत बरसा (Rain of Nectar)
 असीम (Infinite) 
 आषाढ मेघ (Season of Clouds)
 एक शहर था (There Was a City)
 मातीची मने (Hearts of Clay)
 ओळखीची वाट (Waiting for an Introduction)
 झुलते मनात गाणे (Songs in a Swinging Mind)

Other Works 
Satyanarayanan has also translated Smita Jaykar's book, आत्ता नाही तर केव्हा..? into English, as Before Tomorrow. She had penned 150 songs and composed music for several Marathi movies and two Bollywood movies. She was a recipient of several awards in the fields of literature and culture. The 2016 Marathi film, Babanchi Shala (Parents' School), starring Sayaji Shinde, was based on Satyanarayanan's life, and she directed the music for that film.

In 2017, Satyanarayanan composed a song in honor of the Mumbai Fire Brigade, at the request of the Chief Fire Officer. The song, 'Let's Go, Let's Go' was adopted by the Mumbai Fire Brigade at a special ceremony held at the Gateway of India.

Early work
David Prior was born in the UK and studied Music and Religious Studies at the University of Wales, Bangor where he studied composition with Andrew Lewis. He was awarded the prize for composition in his final year for his piece Dense which went on to win a Prix de Residence at the 1996 Bourges International Electroacoustic Music Competition , leading to a residency at Xenakis' UPIC studio in Paris the following year. The piece was short-listed by the Society for the Promotion of New Music (SPNM) and following a performance at the Purcell Room in 1998, it was selected by then SPNM artistic director Howard Skempton for the George Butterworth award.

From Bangor, Prior went on to study composition with Jonty Harrison at the University of Birmingham, graduating with a PhD in 2001. During his time in Birmingham, Prior's work was often concerned with integrating acoustic space as a compositional parameter in his work. This theme stimulated interests which still define the work he is involved in today, whether that be through his installations, sound-walks, acousmatic compositions or the sound designs he has made for museums and galleries. Another feature of the work Prior was producing during this period but less evident in more recent projects, was the attempt to assimilate free improvisation into the devising of his ultimately 'fixed' compositions, for example Somewhere Submarine (1996), for piano and tape (joint winner of the 1997 Cornelius Cardew Composition Competition) and Another Poisonous Sunset (1998).

Prior was awarded a Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst (DAAD) stipendium in 1999, funding a one-year residency at the Technische Universität Berlin, where he completed the work submitted for his PhD. Following the completion of his residency, he stayed living in Berlin, undertaking a commission from the DAAD Kunstlerprogram which led to his twenty-four channel acousmatic piece Love and Death, premiered at the Parochialkirche, Berlin as part of the Inventionen festival, 2000.
In 1997, Prior collaborated with Swiss choreographers Jürg Koch and R. Lucia Baumgartner on the piece an die Materie and the music from this piece went on to win an honorary mention at the 1998 Bourges International Electroacoustic Music Competition  and first prize in the 1998 EAR (Hungarian Radio) composition prize. When Koch went on to join CandoCo dance company, he worked with Prior again, commissioning him to write the score for Amaze in You in 2002.

Liminal: sound and architecture
Prior first collaborated with architect Frances Crow in 1997 on Triptych, an installation jointly commissioned by SPNM and the Southbank Centre, London. They worked together again on the Arts Council funded Good Vibrations children's education project in 1999 but it wasn't until 2003 that they formally established Liminal, a design studio with a particular interest in exploring sound and architecture. The partnership has resulted in projects ranging from installations to sound-walks as well as commercial sound design and consultancy and a number of theoretical publications and conference papers. Liminal was formed as a company in order to undertake Swash (2003), a large-scale, immersive sound installation for Living Coasts in Devon and in keeping with other recent work, this piece has evolved into a number of different iterations. Two years after the completion of the installation version of Swash, Prior made an eight-channel, acousmatic concert version of the piece which was first performed at the Martin Harris Hall in Manchester as part of the Sonic Arts Expo, 2006. In 2007, Prior was commissioned by the SpACE-Net spatial audio research group in York to produce a third, improvised version of the work which has been performed a number of times subsequently. Following the completion of Swash, liminal were made lead sound designers for the Churchill Museum in London designed by celebrated designers Casson Mann. The Churchill Museum has gone on to win a string of awards and was nominated for both the D&AD Award for Outstanding Achievement in Digital Installations and the 2006 Gulbenkian Prize.

Since 2006, liminal have been involved as lead artists in the Warwick Bar development in Birmingham. Their work on this project involved close collaboration with masterplanning architects Kinetic-AIU and has since been cited as an exemplar for artist-architect collaborations by CABE, who part-funded liminal's involvement through their PROJECT fund and features as a case-study in their Artists & Places publication. It was during this project that liminal developed their use of the sound-walk as a research tool, in this instance consolidating the extensive research undertaken into the soundscape of the Warwick Bar site into a binaural walk available to the public. Liminal later contributed to the Cotswold Water Park's twenty-year strategic plan, working with masterplanning consultants Scott Wilson and building on the research techniques they developed for the Warwick Bar project on a series of proposals which address the soundscape of the water park.  Liminal's recent work has focussed on the creation of 'listening spaces', whether this takes the form of a site-specific sound-walk, such as Black Water Brown Water (2008) or architectural interventions such as Song Pole with poet Larry Lynch (2008), the point of departure for these pieces is to create a reflexive listening experience for the audience; focussing attention back onto the act of listening itself.

In 2010 they were awarded £50,000 to create ""The Organ of Corti"" to 'recycle' and create new sounds.

Other sound and music collaborations
Prior began working with New Zealander Dugal McKinnon in 1998 on a composed radio documentary Ways of Hearing  for Resonance FM as part of John Peel's Meltdown festival at the Southbank Centre, London.  The pair went on to form Arcades  in 2000, slowly working towards their album Who's Most Lost? which was completed in late 2007.  Meanwhile, Prior was also asked by UK songwriter John Matthias to produce two tracks on his Ninja Tune release Stories From the Water Cooler.  Prior and Matthias went on to form Derailer, whose first project was to remix a track by Corker Conboy called Radiant Idiot.  The resulting Radiant Idiot Remake, was chosen by American independent film-maker Harmony Korine for his Thornton's television commercial Stuck. The pair have remixed work by John Richards as well as working towards an album of original material.  Prior also remixed John Matthias and Nick Ryan's Cortical Songs, released on the non-classical label.  Prior has recorded and/or produced work for artists and ensembles including Icebreaker, Nicola Hitchcock and Michael Bassett as well as contributing sound designs to films by artists Jane Grant and Anya Lewin.  In 2007, Prior was invited by improvising vocalist Steve Lewis to join Antti Sakari Saario in providing live electronics for his Flocking project based around an improvising ensemble.  Since 2002, Prior has been working with his brother Andrew Prior on a series of collaborative music projects. Their piece Gem Sprinter features on the Yacht Club compilation release Pallomeri under the moniker Orlando Hooks.

Films
Since 2002, Prior has made a series of short films often characterized by their brevity and simplicity.  On a number of these films, Prior has collaborated with poet Larry Lynch, who as well as contributing texts often features in the films themselves.  Their collaboration On What it Might Mean to be Spinning features the voice of poet John Hall and was premiered in February 2008 as part of the Voices III festival in Plymouth, UK.  Prior's films have been screened across the UK, in Russia, Korea, China, Sweden, Holland and the USA.

Awards
Prior's work has won prizes including a number of awards from the Bourges International Electroacoustic Music Competition, Cornelius Cardew Prize, E.A.R (the composition prize of Hungarian National Radio), the George Butterworth prize and a PRS ATOM award. Prior has received awards from the University of Birmingham Alumni award, M.J. West Foundation, the Arts Council of England, the Banff Centre for the Arts, the DAAD and UNESCO.

Academic work
Prior began teaching in the music department at the University of Birmingham in the late 1990s while a post-graduate student there. Since 2001, Prior has been a lecturer, then senior lecturer in music at Dartington College of Arts, Devon.  Prior has given guest lectures and presentations around the world at institutions including the Icelandic Academy of Arts, Reykjavík, Stadia Helsinki Polytechnic and ESMAE School of Music and Performing Arts, Polytechnic Institute of Porto.

Personal life
Prior lives with Frances Crow in Totnes, Devon.

He is best known for his rearguard defense in the Burmese-Siamese War (1759–1760) in Siam as the Burmese forces rushed back a dying Alaungpaya back home. The general, who was well respected by the troops, then rebelled against Alaungpaya's successor Naungdawgyi. He believed he would be executed by the new king with whom he had a long history of enmity. The rebel general seized Ava in June 1760, and withstood the siege for over five months. He was killed by a musket shot as he fled the city in December. A remorseful Naungdawgyi was said to have mourned at the news of the death of his adversary and his father's brother in arms.

Early life
The future general was born Maung Ton ( ) in a small Upper Burma village of Moksobo (present-day Shwebo). He was a childhood friend of Aung Zeya who was a son of chief of Moksobo.

Military service

In 1752, Ton responded to his friend and village chief Aung Zeya's call to resist the occupation armies of the southern kingdom of Hanthawaddy, which had toppled the Toungoo Dynasty at Ava (Inwa). Aung Zeya claimed himself king, and assumed the title of Alaungpaya. Ton went on to fight in all of Alaungpaya's campaigns, winning many titles for valor in the process.

He led one of the Burmese armies in the 1758 Manipuri campaign that made Manipur a tributary state of Burma.

Siam
Minkhaung Nawrahta was one of the lead commanders in Alaungpaya's invasion of Siam in 1759. He led one of the three armies that converged on the Siamese capital of Ayutthaya in April 1760. The Burmese were on the brink of victory when Alaungpaya suddenly fell ill from scrofula.

Alaungpaya personally selected his childhood friend to command the rearguard, which were ""the pick of the army--500 Manipuri Horse and 6,000 foot, everyman of whom had a musket"". Minkhaung Nawrahta spread them out and it was two days before the Siamese realized that the main Burmese army had left. The Siamese then broke out of the walls of Ayutthaya. His men watched the ring closing round them, and fearing to be cut off, begged him to let them fight further back. But he said ""Friends, the safety of our Lord the King lies in our keeping. Let us not fight further back lest the sounds of guns break his further sleep."" With his leadership, the Burmese forces withdrew in good order, collecting army stragglers along the way.

Rebellion
Alaungpaya died on 11 May 1760, and his son Naungdawgyi succeeded him. Alaungpaya's second son Hsinbyushin had tried to take over the throne but failed. Naungdawgyi pardoned his younger brother at the queen mother's intercession. But the king was suspicious of other revolts. He sent for two of the generals he disliked. When they came unsuspectingly, he executed them without allowing them to see him. The army was furious.

Minkhaung Nawrahta too was concerned because of the old enmity between him and Naungdawgyi. He deliberately slowed down his rearguard back to Shwebo. Naungdawgyi then ordered his arrest. Although he had not been involved in Hsinbyushin's conspiracy, Minkhaung Nawrahta felt sure that he would be stripped of his command, and probably executed on some excuse. He decided to rebel even though he had no definite plan of rebellion. It was more a gesture of defiance.

He had been a simple villager in 1752, and he had fought in all the campaigns, shoulder to shoulder with Alaungpaya. He looked back on those eventful years, the victories that had come his way, and the titles and the honors that had been showered upon him by his grateful master. He said to his followers:
""I was a common villager when I drew my sword and said to my lord: ""My friend, my comrade, the Mons are winning everywhere and thou must defeat them. With this sword, I shall make thee king or die in the attempt."" But those days are gone, and my gracious master, who alone could help me in this crisis, is no more. This is no time for regret or fear, and I must strike, come what may.""

His army occupied Ava on 25 June 1760. His garrison repelled all attacks by the king's army but by December, the city was starving. Seeing that the surrender was inevitable, the rebel general and a band of devoted followers fled the city. More than once, the pursuers surrounded him. But he still commanded such respect among the troops that the pursuers fell back in awe when he strode through them. In the Shan hills above Kyaukse, he was brought down by a musket shot. Even then, he overpowered the assailant who grappled with him, and had to be finished with a second shot. Such was the end of Alaungpaya's brother in arms.

Minkhaung Nawrahta was respected even by his adversary, Naungdawgyi. When Minkhaung Nawrahta's dead body was brought before him, the king was remorseful, saying ""Should ye have slain so great a man?""

Bob Eubanks hosted and Orlando-area disc jockey Dean Miuccio announced. The show was taped at the Disney-MGM Studios in Orlando, Florida in front of a live studio audience consisting of theme park guests.

Gameplay
Two families, consisting of two parents and one child, competed in a game similar to Eubanks' own The Newlywed Game.

Round 1
In round one, the parents were brought into isolation, then the kids were asked  two questions about their dad. Their dads were then brought out of isolation and were asked for their answers to the same questions. Each match was worth $100. The process is then repeated with two questions about their moms.

Round 2
In round two, the kids are put in isolation. The parents are then asked two questions about their kids. The kids were then brought out to answer the same questions, with each match being worth $200.

Final question
For the last question, a numerical question about the average American family was asked. Each family had ten seconds to write down their answer. The family that came closest (or, if both families were in the same numerical range, the family with the higher number) won $500. After this round, the family with the most money (out of a possible $1,300) won the game, an extra prize and moved on to the bonus round. If there was a tie at the end of the game, a second numerical question was asked with the same rules.

Bonus round
The bonus round was played for a family vacation. Up to five trivia questions would be asked of the winning team. Before each question, Eubanks would give the child the category of the question and have them decide whether mom or dad would answer it. If the team gave three wrong answers, the round ended with a loss, but if they gave three correct answers they won the trip.

Controversy
During the series' run, controversy arose when one team competing on the show turned out not to be a real family.  Identifying themselves as the Hansen family, the team actually consisted of a father, his 10-year-old daughter and his live-in girlfriend who posed as the daughter's mother.  A May 1993 Chicago Tribune report reported the team won $6,000 in prizes, but the girl's real mother discovered the deception.  She contacted NBC and Dave Bell Associates, the series' packagers, to get the episode pulled before its intended May 27, 1993 broadcast date.  Officials at both companies agreed to pull the episode and replace it with a rerun.  The father and his girlfriend married on June 11, 1993, the same date of the series finale.

The daughter was awarded her prizes (a camera and a CD player), but the family was not awarded the family cruise or their cash.

Cancellation
The series was cancelled after 12 weeks not only because of low ratings, but also because not enough contestants were meeting eligibility requirements.  The series was replaced with Caesars Challenge.

The PSNCR is distinct from, but often confused with, the United Kingdom national debt, which is the total amount of money owed by the British Government to its creditors at any given time. The greater the PSNCR, the more the National Debt will tend to increase. The PSNCR is also distinct from the debt interest, which is the amount the UK government must pay annually to finance the existing national debt.

Financing the PSNCR
The PSNCR is financed by borrowing – principally by means of the sale of government gilt edged stocks, usually known as gilts. Since 2009 large quantities of gilts have been created and repurchased by the Bank of England under its policy of quantitative easing, with a view to stimulating economic growth.

Recent history

In 1997 the Labour government of Tony Blair inherited a PSNCR of approximately £5 billion per annum, but by sticking to the parsimonious spending plans of the outgoing Conservative Government, this was gradually turned into a modest budget surplus. Labour began to pursue a looser fiscal policy following the 2000 Spending Review, and they started to run an annual deficit from January 2002. This cash requirement reached £43.935 bn in September 2005 before declining to £23.916 bn in September 2007. Even excluding bank interventions, the PSNCR then climbed through the Great Recession to peak at £206.116 bn in August 2009 and dropped to £71.135 bn in April 2014.

Coalition government policy was to bring down the PSNCR to zero within the lifetime of the 2010–2015 parliament. In his budget speech in March 2011 Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne stated that ""Our fiscal mandate is to achieve a cyclically-adjusted current balance by the end of the rolling five year forecast period – which is currently 2015–16"" but having failed to do this by 2015 his revised aim was to balance the books by 2020. Following the departure of George Osborne, his replacement Philip Hammond dropped the goal of eliminating the budget deficit, giving himself leeway to help the economy cope with the slowdown expected as Britain prepares to leave the European Union.

With a capacity of 54,139, the stadium is the largest in Georgia. Built in 1976 by the Georgian architect Gia Kurdiani, the Dinamo Arena was named Vladimir Ilyich Lenin Dinamo Stadium after Russian Communist leader but later, in 1995 was renamed to Boris Paichadze National Stadium after the famous Georgian football player Boris Paichadze (1915–1990). Prior to the construction of Boris Paichadze Dinamo Arena, the home stadium of Dinamo Tbilisi was the Central Stadium with an approximate capacity of 35,000 spectators. The demand for a much bigger stadium was increased with the successful performance of Dinamo Tbilisi in the mid 1970s. After the inauguration of the stadium, it became the third-largest in the Soviet Union, with a capacity of 74,354 spectators.

Background

On 29 September 1976, the first official match was played at the newly built stadium between Dinamo Tbilisi and Welsh Cardiff City. The game ended with a 3–0 victory for Dinamo.

The stadium hosted many glorious days during Dinamo's 1978 and 1979 triumphs. Holding lighted torches, 80,000 fans came in 1981 just to congratulate the 1980–81 European Cup Winners' Cup winning team Dinamo Tbilisi.

The Dinamo Arena is now one of the largest stadiums in Eastern Europe. Most of the seats in the second tier are covered by the roof. The USSR national football team played several international matches on the Dinamo Arena. Football clubs Spartak Moscow, Dynamo Kiev and Dynamo Moscow often played their autumn international matches at the stadium.

100,000 fans attended the opening game of the First Georgian Championship, match between FC Dinamo Tbilisi and FC Kolkheti-1913 Poti. The record attendance was in 1979, when 110,000 gathered to help Dinamo beat Liverpool F.C. 3:0 to go through to the European Champion Clubs' Cup quarter final, and in 1995, Georgia-Germany 0-2, UEFA EURO 1996 qualifaying match. In the Soviet Union, the stadium had the record for the highest average attendance (around 65,000 per game).

In 1995, the stadium was renamed to Boris Paichadze National Stadium, after the former Georgian football player. The National Stadium has been the home ground of the Georgian National Football Team for several years. Georgia achieved memorable wins against Wales (5-0), and Poland (3-0).

The stadium was refurbished in 2006 and became an all-seater stadium. This reduced the capacity to 54,549.

On 11 August 2015, the stadium hosted UEFA Super Cup match between FC Barcelona and Sevilla FC.

History

The newly built ""Dinamo"" stadium, housing 23,000 spectators, was inaugurated in Tbilisi in 1936. The author of the project design was architect Archil Kurdiani (the elder).

It was under his leadership that in 1956 the stadium has been subject to reconstruction with the edition of steel structures, which has made it possible to increase its occupancy up to 36.000 spectators.

The reconstructed Dinamo Arena stadium was inaugurated on 26 September 1976. Architects Archil Kurdiani (the elder) and Gia Kurdiani, along with the construction designer Shalva Gazashvili extended the capacity of the stadium to 74,354.

Fragments of the 1936 Stadium were partly maintained, and yet quite complex architectural-designing construction elements were realized. The facility represented a console system supported by 58 pylons.  Each of these pylons been supported by 24 poles, where the depth of each ranged from 8 to 12 meters. The console system comprised several elements.
The evacuation terrace was arranging spectators ascending by 23 stairs between the II and I tiers. The II tier, like the evacuation terrace, represented an element of indivisible console system.

The solution for Roofing of II tier was also of the console design.  30 meter console-design roofing protects spectators against precipitations.

The Author’s approach for calculating and designing the Visual angle for II tier was original thus ensuring full visibility of the stadium for any spectator from any seat. The roof was also used as a cite for placement of lightning and insonification.
The stadium was equipped by two electronic boards. At the level of evacuation terrace were arranged government boxes and commentary studios. The area below evacuation terrace and Ist tier tribunes housed floor sporting facilities, swimming pool, administrative unit and other administrative facilities arranged at floors from 1 to 2. The Stadium, along its entire perimeter was encircled by 2 communication tunnels. One at the ground level, while the other between the ground level and evacuation terrace. The stadium was fenced.

The former swimming pool of the stadium now houses the nightclub Bassiani.

Origins

The first theological college for the Perth diocese was St John's College, founded by Charles Lefroy in 1899 and which closed in 1929. From its closure in 1929 to the opening of Wollaston in 1957, 49 candidates were sent to the Eastern States for theological training: 23 to St Barnabas' College, Adelaide, 14 to St John's College, Morpeth, six to St Michael's House, Crafers, three to Ridley College, Melbourne, two to St Francis's College, Brisbane, and one to Moore College, Sydney. It speaks for the churchmanship of Perth at the time that only four candidates attended the two Evangelical colleges (Ridley and Moore).

In 1950 the Perth Diocesan Synod resolved to establish a theological college. In 1956 the City of Perth agreed to sell five acres to the Diocese, and in the same year the Rev Tony Pierce was appointed first Warden.  Archbishop Moline's intention was to have a college that was neither 'high' nor 'low'. The college was located in the Perth suburb of Mount Claremont. Its centrepiece was the Chapel designed by noted architect Julius Elischer, influenced by Le Corbusier's Notre-Dame du Haut in Ronchamp, France. The founding and only Warden of this period of full-time post-secondary residential theological education was C. A. Pierce, Chaplain of Magdalene College, Cambridge and a noted New Testament scholar.

Courses and programmes
From 1957 to 1970 ordinands from Perth and the other West Australian dioceses undertook a largely residential program based on Wollaston, typically studying for the Licentiate or Diploma in Theology of the Australian College of Theology. The course programme changed significantly over the years. Initially the intention was that students should complete the ThL (Licentiate in Theology) in the first two years of residence, followed by a third year of Honours.

In 1970 under new Archbishop Geoffrey Sambell the Diocese of Perth changed its policy, with the result that the first two years of training for ordination candidates were spent at a residential theological college elsewhere in Australia, followed by a third year of practical training based at Wollaston with ordination to the diaconate at the start of that year. This directly led to the resignation of Pierce as Warden. For more than a decade students from WA were thus again sent away to study, and the Wollaston campus became in large part a retreat and conference centre for the Diocese. While the name ""John Wollaston Theological College"" was retained, wardens of this period were administrators sometimes engaged in retreat conducting and spiritual direction, as well as working with the deacon-interns and in post-ordination training.

When local theological education recommenced in 1983 in conjunction with the Perth College of Divinity and Murdoch University at the initiative of Archbishop Peter Carnley, Wollaston again become a centre for local formation of degree-seeking students, but on a non-resident basis and not as the primary center for teaching. It has continued in this mode, with some changes in specific programmes; in 2020 Murdoch University announced its intention to cease theological teaching, and Wollaston announced a partnership with the Theological School of Trinity College, Melbourne, to teach for degrees of the University of Divinity.

Chapel
The chapel, which has no dedication, is the dominant feature of the college site. It was designed by the Hungarian-born Perth architect, Julius Elischer. There is no set place for the altar or any furniture, to enable it to be configured in multiple ways. The design is based strongly on Le Corbusier's Chapel of Notre-Dame du Haut in Ronchamp, built ten years earlier. (Elischer had worked under Ferninand Streb, a pupil of Le Corbusier's.) Like Notre Dame du Haut, the stark white interior is punctuated by deep-set windows of different coloured glass. The architect's vision was of a 'tent of meeting'. It was consecrated in 1965 by Michael Ramsey, the then Archbishop of Canterbury.

Through contemporising Māori waiata during World War II, Ngāwai contributed to the Māori renaissance.

Biography 
Her iwi is Ngati Porou and her hapu is Te Whanau a Ruataupare. Born at Tokomaru Bay, her twin sister died in infancy, and Moetū was given the name Tuini, a transliteration of twin. Ngāwai taught Māori culture in schools, leaving in 1946 to work as a shearing gang supervisor.

Her niece Ngoi Pēwhairangi was also a composer. The Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa holds a photograph of Ngāwai and Ngoi Pewhairangi performing with Ngāwai's concert party Te Hokowhitu-ā-Tū.

Performance work 
Tuini Ngāwai composed many songs using European tunes, to encourage Māori pride to raise morale among Māori at home and at the war. Her legacy is recognised by contemporary kapa haka performers and composers, and it is thought she created over 200 concert party works. 

She was considered a protégé of Āpirana Ngata. Many, such as ""Hoki mai e tama mā"" and ""E te Hokowhitu-a-Tū"" (to the tune of ""In the Mood"") are still sung today. In 1939 she founded the Te Hokowhitu-ā-Tū Māori kapa haka group, this was to acknowledge the local men and boys who went to war with C Company as part of the 28th Māori Battalion. The religious song ""Arohaina Mai"" became the unofficial hymn of the Māori Battalion. Recordings of some of her work are held in the sound collection of Ngā Taonga Sound and Vision and the Alexander Turnbull Library.

Ngāwai's songs were used to promote and demand the honouring of the Treaty of Waitangi by Māori activists.

Death 
Ngāwai died in August 1965. Her funeral ceremony (tangihanga) was held in the meeting house Te Hono-Ki-Rarotonga, at Pakirikiri Marae in Tokomaru Bay.

Awards 
In 2022 Ngāwai was inducted into the New Zealand Music Hall of Fame.

It is one of three local authorities that succeeded the former Dublin County Council on its abolition on 1 January 1994 and one of four councils in the old County Dublin. As a county council, it is governed by the Local Government Act 2001. The council is responsible for housing and community, roads and transportation, urban planning and development, amenity and culture, and environment. The council has 40 elected members. Elections are held every five years and are by single transferable vote. The head of the council has the title of Cathaoirleach (Chairperson). The county administration is headed by a Chief Executive, Frank Curran. The county town is Dún Laoghaire. It serves a population of approximately 206,260.

History
Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown County Council came into being on 1 January 1994.

Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown County Council traces its history back to local government structures that have existed in the area since 1834. The Council was established under the Local Government (Dublin) Act 1993 by the merger of the Corporation of Dún Laoghaire and that part of Dublin County Council that chiefly corresponded to the former Rathdown No 1 Rural District.

The two sides of the County have distinct histories in terms of local government structures. On the Dún Laoghaire side of the County, the Borough of Dún Laoghaire had been established by the Local Government (Dublin) Act 1930 as a successor body to Kingstown (later Dún Laoghaire), Blackrock, Dalkey and Killiney Townships. Those Commissioners for Kingstown were established in 1834 and were subsequently renamed Kingstown Urban District Council and then Dún Laoghaire Urban District Council. On the Rathdown side of the County, Dublin County Council and Rathdown No. 1 Rural District Council were established under the Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898. Rathdown No. 1 Rural District Council was abolished by the Local Government (Dublin) Act 1930.

On its formation, the Town Hall in Dún Laoghaire became the headquarters of Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown County Council. It was subsequently renamed County Hall.

M50 and compensation to Jackson Way Properties
An agreement was reached for Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown County Council to compensate Jackson Way Properties by €12,860,700 for the compulsory purchase in October 1998 of its freehold interest in the lands, adjoining the M50 motorway. The Council agreed to pay costs and expenses properly incurred by Jackson Way Properties in relation to preparation and submission of its claim.

The 2003 award total is broken down as follows:
 Land taken – €9,691,000
 Injurious affection – €2,296,700 and
 Disturbance – €873,000.

It had been the view of the Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB) that €4.2 million of this award represents the present value of corrupt enrichment by the property owners although this view is based on hearsay evidence given by Frank Dunlop. A company called Paisley Park Investments Ltd were registered as full owners in 1992 and the land was transferred to Jackson Way Properties in 1993, the beneficial owners of which are believed by CAB to be arcade owner James Kennedy and solicitor John Coldwell. However, in January 2014 the freezing order was lifted owing to the collapse of the associated political corruption trial involving Dún Laoghaire Rathdown County Council Cathaoirleach Tony Fox; damages were subsequently sought against CAB by Jackson Way.

In early 2016, the Office of the Information Commissioner found against the council for refusing to comply with a Freedom of Information request relating to the case, stating as follows, ""I find it very difficult to accept that the Council holds no records coming within the scope of the request that cannot be released to the applicant under the FOI Act. It seems to me that the Council adopted a blanket approach to the request by claiming that the exemptions applied to all records coming within the scope of the request and did not conduct a record by record examination.""

Criminal Assets Bureau investigation
The Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB) successfully obtained a High Court order on 26 July 2006 freezing land assets of  at Carrickmines, County Dublin, owned by Jackson Way Properties Ltd and preventing their sale. CAB contended that these lands had been rezoned on 16 December 1997 by Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown County Council from agricultural to industrial use after Frank Dunlop bribed and made corrupt payments to councillors to secure their support in the rezoning vote. That vote increased the value of just  of the property from €8 million to €61 million. CAB has interviewed and taken statements from Dunlop and will use him as a witness against a number of property developers; Dunlop served a jail sentence for corruption in Arbour Hill from May 2009 to July 2010.

The lands in question have been the subject of investigation by the Mahon Tribunal in 2003 and 2004.

Criminal Assets Bureau v. Jackson Way Properties was due for hearing in the High Court Dublin in October 2010, which was vigorously defended with Jackson Way denying any wrongdoing and Mr Kennedy a tax exile currently living in Gibraltar returning to give evidence in the case. Jackson Way gave the court notice that they intend to subpoena councillors to give evidence. No Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown representative to date has been charged with any form of wrongdoing in relation to rezoning, likely because in January 2014 the freezing order was lifted owing to the collapse of a political corruption trial involving Frank Dunlop and Jacksonway's subsequent legal proceedings against CAB.

Revenue generation 
There have been complaints about the Council's policies regarding commercial rates and parking charges and also complaints from business owners in the town about the way in which the Council enforces the collection of parking charges and fines. Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown local authority area has the second highest level of revenue generation of local authorities in the state after Dublin City.

It is located along the N46 road between the city of Groningen and the Eemshaven seaport.

History 
The village was first mentioned in 1424 as ""Ubba Ffockema up den Zyldyck"", and means sluice and dike. In 1272, a sluice was built at the site in the newly poldered land around 't Zandt. In 1317, a dike was built northwards towards Uithuizermeeden. In 1444, the land to the east of Zijldijk was poldered and the sluice became obsolete.

Zijldijk has three churches. The Mennomite church was built in 1772 in a non conspicuous barn-like building. It is still in use as a church. The Dutch Reformed church has been reconstructed as a village house. The Reformed Church was constructed in 1886, and nowadays serves as a care facility.

Zijldijk was home to 454 people in 1840.

In 2010, Ocean Park had a population of 1,667 and a population density of 8,335 persons per square mile.

Description

About one kilometer off the beach is the small rocky Island Stone which is also part of the area, measuring about 100 by 50 meters.

Ocean Park is bound on the east by Calle Guerrero Noble and its straight extension to the beach, a short piece of Calle Cacique running east to connect to Calle Teniente Rivera, and the connecting piece of Calle Soldado Cruz to Calle Loíza. The southern border runs to Calle Loíza, but excluding same. In the west, it is Calle María Mozco (northern part) and Calle Santa Ana. The north is bordered by the beach and the Atlantic Ocean. Through the center runs Avenida McLeary where cafes, pubs and some services line the street.

Calle Loíza is a ""trendy spot"" with new businesses, bars, restaurants and boutiques.

Ocean Park is located between Condado and Isla Verde beaches making it an essential tranquil, tree-lined street residential neighborhood, with numerous examples of single-family homes from the decades between 1930 and 1950. Small bed-and-breakfast inns, which blend in with the residential community, dot the area. Its wide oceanfront and offshore reefs prevent large waves from reaching the beach, which is popular with trendy beachgoers. Strong seasonal onshore trade winds make the area popular for kitesurfing and windsurfing.

At the right of the barrio is the Parque Barbosa and the residential area of Santa Teresita, forming the eastern part of the barrio. Parque Barbosa, also known as Ultimo Trolley (Last Tram) is the home of the Ocean Park Marlins Futbol Club, a football team with categories from 5-year-old kids to ""Superior"" (semi-professional) both for female and male footballers. Último Trolley got its name because it was the last electric streetcar that crossed the streets of San Juan from 1901 to 1946 and was placed in the park and operated as a restaurant.

The magazine was founded by Queen Soraya Tarzi. It was founded as a part of the king and queen's modernization project to reform Afghan society, a policy which included the emancipation of women, and the Irshad-e Naswan as well as the first women's association Anjuman-i Himayat-i-Niswan were both founded to support the state feminism of the royal government. 

The magazine was published weekly and ran articles ""on the rights of women, child care, home economics and etiquette"",  social, political and international issues, women's rights but also fashion and household tips.  It took up subject in women's issues and reform and has played a major pioneering role in the history of women in Afghanistan, and has been described as the first newspaper to enlighten women in Afghanistan. 

It was edited by the queen's mother, Asma Rasmya, who thus became the first female editor in Afghanistan, and queen Soraya herself occasionally contributed to it. 

King Amanullah Khan and Queen Soraya Tarzi were deposed in 1929. Their deposition from power was followed by a severe backlash on women's rights under their successor Habibullah Ghazi.  The Women's Association Anjuman-i Himayat-i-Niswan as well as Irshad-e Naswan was banned, the girls 'schools were closed, and the female students who had been allowed to study in Turkey was recalled to Afghanistan and forced to put on the veil and enter purdah again.

It was released as the second single from their fourth studio album, Too Weird to Live, Too Rare to Die!, on August 12, 2013. A music video for the song, directed by Daniel Cloud Campos, was also released on the same day. It peaked at number 87 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart.

Music video

The music video for ""This Is Gospel"" was released on August 12, 2013, coinciding with the song's single release, through Fueled by Ramen's YouTube channel. It was directed by Daniel ""Cloud"" Campos. As of October 2021,the video has over 211 million views on YouTube.

The video features Brendon at the moment when surgeons check his injuries. As they almost start to open his body, he removes the air mask and begins to fight, but tortured. A few seconds later, he is tricked by people and dressed up nicely; however, he is buried alive (with water) and tries to swim in the endless water and break a cardboard wall. Eventually, the scene returns to the surgery, and the surgeons discover that rope is in his body; they used it but he runs away, but pays a life due to suffocation and losing breath from the ropes on his throat. The music video for the band's song ""Emperor's New Clothes"" is a direct continuation of this video, just as the music video for the band's song ""Say Amen (Saturday Night)"" is the prequel to this video.

The Music video to the Piano version consists of Urie sitting at a piano in an empty lot and performing the song while streamers, confetti, and ribbons are dropped on him and the piano. Eventually large amounts of water balloons, milk, eggs, noodles, pickles, chicken, and various other discarded foods are dropped onto the piano. As Urie walks away at the end of the song, buckets of blue and purple water are dumped on him. The video was uploaded to Fueled by Ramen's YouTube channel on May 14, 2014.

Advertised as a tribute to the Golden Age of Horror, the packaging featured images from Universal Classic Monster films Bride of Frankenstein, Werewolf of London, and Dracula.  The album featured the blend of dark orchestral music, sound effects, and audio storytelling that the band had become known for.

Background and album information 
In a 2013, interview with Scary Monsters Magazine, composer, Edward Douglas said this about the album:  Monsters of Legend is Midnight Syndicate's tribute to the classic horror films (especially those of Universal and Hammer) that shaped horror cinema. When you listen to the album, we want you to feel like you are a character in one of those classic horror films exploring a place where mysterious townsfolk, a foreboding castle up the cliffs, and any one of the iconic monsters could be lurking right around the corner. The music (which has a very Hammeresque and Herrmannesque feel to it) is blended with sound effects to make you feel like you are right there... especially with headphones (on) or in a quiet room.

In addition to the sixteen new tracks on the album, were five previously released tracks that were given new arrangements and additional material by Edward Douglas. The most notable additions to the old tracks were voice actor, Dick Terhune performing on a new arrangement of the song, Requiem and vocalist Amber Foth (also featured on Carnival Arcane) performing on a new version of Twilight.

Reception
Monsters of Legend received favorable reviews from many horror film bloggers like Theofantastique and Mr. Frights, role-playing game-related publications like Black Gate and Games Gazette, and amusement park sites like, Behind the Thrills. Mr. Dark of the horror website, Dread Central, wrote that: ""This is what Midnight Syndicate does best: dark, goth instrumental orchestrations that fit a general theme and provide an excellent mental backdrop to all things horror."" Aaron Von Lupton of Rue Morgue Magazine it ""mood music for horror fans."" Music reviewer, Elise Din, of Side-Line Music Magazine and Halloween and home haunt YouTuber Dave Dankanyin called it the band's best work yet.  FEARnet included the album in its Best of 2013: Top 13 Horror-Friendly albums of 2013.

In May 2014, Monsters of Legend won the Best Horror CD category in the 12th annual Rondo Hatton Classic Horror Awards. The album was nominated for Best RPG Related Product in the 2014 ENnie Awards in the role-playing game industry.

History

Overview
ERT began broadcasting in 1938 as the Radio Broadcasting Service or YRE ().

Following a government decision, the original company was abolished on 11 June 2013, with its 2,656 employees protesting against the closure and continuing broadcasting via a satellite transmission using European Broadcasting Union equipment. The EBU also began providing Internet streaming of the ERT broadcast.

On 12 June 2013, the Greek government proposed a successor organization, New Hellenic Radio, Internet and Television (), shortened to NERIT (), which launched in August 2013 as ""Public Television"" (). As protests against the decision of the government (Coalition of New Democracy, PASOK, DIMAR) continued, on 15 June Prime Minister Samaras proposed returning ERT to service immediately, by having an emergency committee rehire selected employees. This offer was rejected by the ERT employees and Samaras' coalition partners.

On 17 June 2013, following an appeal by ERT's employees to the Council of State (Greece's highest administrative court), the Council suspended the government's decision to interrupt broadcasting and shut down ERT's frequencies and ordered the Finance Minister and the minister responsible for media, signing the decision, to take ""all necessary organisational measures for the continuation of transmission of broadcasting services and operation of internet websites by a public broadcaster for the period until the establishment and operation of a new operator that will serve the public's interest"". In his ruling, the Council's President found that the government's decision violated Law 1730/1987 which requires ""the contribution by a public broadcaster to informing, educating and entertaining the Greek people and the diaspora"". The Council's appellate division upheld the original Temporary Injunction three days later.

Until 24 October 2013, ERT's employees were able to offer the television programmes of NET (also simulcast in HD as ERT-HD) and ET3, and the radio programmes of ERA Athens-Thessaloniki and Third Programme through conventional means (analogue and digital TV, FM, medium and shortwave radio broadcasts) as well as over the Internet. At approximately 18:11 EEST, ERT lost their satellite capacity on the Astra 23.5°E satellite after successful lobbying by the Greek government to the capacity provider SES S.A. That halted most conventional TV and radio broadcasts that received the feed from the satellite, but did not affect the regional ERA affiliates that produced their programming locally, nor a large part of Athens which is served by a DVB-T transmitter located within the ERT HQ in Ayia Paraskevi. Web streaming wasn't affected at all.

, more than nine months after the decision to close down ERT, the striking workers still ran 17 radio stations (15 regional, two national) and a single TV channel (ET3), from the regional radio studios, and the ET3 Television Building in Thessaloniki. FM and AM transmissions continued throughout Greece with some interruptions and shortwave transmissions continued with a weaker transmission power. All radio stations were also available as webstreams. The TV channel was sporadically transmitted in conventional means (analogue transmitters in Thessaloniki), and was always available as a webstream.

In April 2015, the Hellenic Parliament approved the draft of re-opening ERT S.A. and also voted and approved the draft of re-opening this broadcaster.

As of 11 June 2015, ERT again started broadcasting, replacing NERIT.

1938–2013
ERT began broadcasting in 1938 as the Radio Broadcasting Service or YRE (), initially limited to radio services from Athens, with the Athens Radio Station based in the Zappeion. During the Axis occupation of Greece, the service was renamed as the Limited Hellenic Radio Company or AERE (). After Liberation, in 1945 the service was reorganized as the National Radio Foundation or EIR (), still based at Zappeion. The radio services were expanded to three national radio services as well as international radio services for emigrant Greeks. EIR was one of 23 founding broadcasting organizations of the European Broadcasting Union in 1950.

Test television broadcasts began in 1965 and full TV service began in 1966. In 1970, the company was renamed National Radio and Television Foundation or EIRT (). In 1966, the Hellenic Armed Forces began their own TV station, the Armed Forces Television or TED (), renamed in 1970 as the Armed Forces Information Service or YENED (). Television was prominently used as a propaganda medium by the Greek junta. YENED its name and military orientation until the early 1980s, when it was renamed ERT2 by the then PASOK government. On 1 September 1987, a third station was added – ET3, based in Thessaloniki, with mostly regional programming focused on Macedonia and the rest of Northern Greece.

During the first 20 years of TV services in Greece, ERT broadcasting was limited, starting at around 5pm to between midnight and 2am. Since 1997 the three ERT TV channels are known as ET1, NET and ET3, and broadcast round the clock. ET1 is an entertainment channel whereas NET is focused on news services. ET3 is still focused on Northern Greece issues, although it broadcasts nationwide.

ERT was a major national sponsor and the official broadcaster of the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens. It has been broadcasting the Olympic Games in Greece since the Mexico City Games of 1968. It also broadcasts IAAF games while it is shown on privately owned channels mainly in the United States. Today it broadcasts documentaries, some from the private sector, and a few animated shows. With the introduction of independent privately owned channels in Greece in the late 1980s, programme quality changed to a more commercial variety, in order to survive the fierce competition for ratings. This was a major shift in the network's principles that was dominated by wider variety, alleged ""higher quality"" programmes including documentaries and World Cinema.

On 19 August 2011 the Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation announced a planned restructuring of the company; ERT's main channels became NET and ET3, while ET1 was incorporated into the program of NET and ET3. Additionally the digital channels Cine+ and Sport+ ceased broadcasting, and their programming were again incorporated into that of the company's two major domestic channels. ERT World also saw changes in its programming to reflect the needs of the Greek diaspora as identified by a survey conducted by ERT. The Minister of State also said that the company would become public but no longer state-owned.

Closure
At 17:45 EEST (UTC+3) on 11 June 2013, the Greek spokesperson, Simos Kedikoglou, announced ERT would close by the end of the day. ERT shutdown caused the loss of 2,500 employees.

ERT was dissolved by a Common Ministerial Decision that was enacted by virtue of Article 14B of Law 3429/2005 (regarding the dissolution, merger and restructuring of public companies) as amended by an urgent government Legislative Ordinace (FEK 139/11.06.2013, Issue A'). Despite running a budget surplus on income from a license fee outside the state budget, in a televised statement, Simos Kedikoglou, the minister responsible for media and the government's spokesperson, said that the ERT was a ""haven of waste"" that cost more and had fewer viewers than private stations.

Later in the evening, some of ERT workers managed to continue the broadcasting via Ustream. Police forced their way into at least one of the transmitting stations, and all ERT transmitters were closed down around Greece, as was eventually the worldwide ERT World feed. Using satellite offices and other spaces that had not been closed down, ERT journalists continued to broadcast to the Internet. The nearest ERT Transmitters to Athens closed at approximately 23:17 local time. 20 seconds later, channel 902TV (the communist party channel) retransmits the ERT signal, although a few minutes later, the Greek government called Digea, the digital television service, to close the signal [902's] due to rebroadcasting the signal without permission, and so 902 was closed for a period of time. This action was deemed unacceptable by most Greek citizens due to the Greek Government shutting down ERT without consulting the National Council of Radio and Television, the official body of Radio and Television in Greece.

On 12 June at noon local time, the AS and IP range of ERT, the official domain names ""ert.gr"", ""ert3.gr"", and ""voiceofgreece.gr"" were cancelled in the Greek Internet registry, meaning that live broadcasts on the Internet (ERT LIVE) have stopped, as well as the publication of all news articles. Emails sent to the broadcasters are no longer delivered. Other Internet assets registered by ERT are at risk of being closed (because their owner and contact address are no longer valid), notably the official Facebook page and Twitter account. ERT LIVE is relayed by other sites, such as the University of Greece.

The European Broadcasting Union was quick to criticise the closure, issuing a statement the same evening where they expressed ""profound dismay on behalf of Europe’s entire public service media"" and urged the prime minister to reverse the decision. The EBU made the ERT stream available on satellite to its members, declaring as well that ""to be in the EBU, you must be a broadcaster, and so we will continue keeping ERT on the EBU council"" as said by the director, Ingrid Delterne.

Alexis Tsipras, the leftwing opposition leader, who would later become Prime Minister, expressed dismay in regards of ERT's shutdown and described it as ""illegal"".

NERIT

On 12 June 2013 a Greek government spokesperson, Simos Kedikoglou, announced the formation of a new public service broadcaster, New Hellenic Radio, Internet and Television. The company's services were expected to launch on 29 August 2013. The service provider employed between 1,000 and 1,200 and was funded by advertising and tax contributions.

Prior to its launch on television, a temporary state television broadcaster known as Dimosia Tileorasi (English: Public Television) launched on 10 July 2013 on the frequencies of ERT, launching as Elliniki Dimosia Tileorasi (English: Greek Public Television). It was closed on 4 May 2014, in order for it to be replaced by NERIT.

Relaunch of ERT
In 2015, the government, under Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, restored ERT as Greece's public broadcaster and NERIT ceased broadcasting on 11 June 2015, at 6:00 EEST.

Services

The interval signal for all ERA programmes are several opening bars of the folk song ""Tsopanakos Imouna"" (Once I Was A Shepherd Boy).
Kosmos 93.6 is primarily a world music (ethnic, soul, jazz, etc.) station.
Voice of Greece (ERA 5) is an international audience shortwave radio station. Under the name of the ERA International Network, Voice of Greece and some ERA domestic programmes were rebroadcast on AM and FM stations throughout the globe.

Funding
ERT is mainly funded by a license fee, which is also paid with the electricity bill (along with other applicable taxes) which represents the vast majority of resources in the public group. The fee was 4.74 euros per month in 2013, equal to 66.88 euros annually, but was reduced to 3 euros per month upon the launch of ERT. It is not connected with actual ownership of a TV set.

There are modest grants from the government for contributing to educational public missions. However, since 2008, some commercial resources from advertisers (even though the channels have lost significant parts of audiences) and the economic crisis in Greece has severely impacted the profitability of advertising and of commercial cooperation for the joint production of programs, as well as the collection of license fees on electricity bills.

Corporate identity
The opening bars of Tsopanakos Imouna () is ERT’s corporate theme music, as well as their interval signal on radio.

ERT is the holder of the biggest audiovisual archive in Greece, which includes also significant moments of modern Greek history.

Confusingly from 1848 to 1860, the company name was used by two separate operators.

History

Although a steamer first called at Hayle in 1824, regular weekly services began in 1831, when the Hayle Steamship Company was formed operating with the wooden vessel Herald, under the command of John Vivian.

The engineering company Harvey's of Hayle built the engines for the PS Cornwall of 1842. When the Great Western Railway arrived in Bristol, this stimulated more travel between London and the South West of England, and the PS Cornwall was added to the Hayle service under the command of John Vivian. The extra business attracted a rival when Vivian Stevens of St Ives put his PS Brilliant on to the Hayle to Bristol route.

The Hayle Steamship Company was renamed the Hayle and Bristol Steam Packet Company in 1848, and confusingly Vivian Stevens with the PS Brilliant adopted the same title.

The original Hayle and Bristol Steam Packet Company launched a prospectus in 1857 to attract capital investment. The secretary of the new company was Mr John Vivian of Hayle. The company was launched with nominal capital of £28,750 () and working capital of £23,000 (). The company prospectus announced that a First Class A.1. 12 years Iron Steamer was being built at Hayle, by Harvey and Co, capable of carrying 200 Tons of Cargo, with ample accommodation for passengers. The cost of this new steamer was £18,000 (), and in 1858, the company launched the Cornubia. The company also planned to sell the Cornwall for £2,000 () when the SS Cornubia was launched.

The additional traffic was short-lived, as the extension of railway services from London and Bristol through into Cornwall was completed when the Royal Albert Bridge was completed and opened on 2 May 1859.

Both Hayle and Bristol Steam Packet Companies amalgamated around 1860, probably as a result of traffic diminishing. The company undertook voluntary liquidation following a meeting of the shareholders on 6 November 1861. Steamer services continued, and attempted competition with screw vessels. Having sold off the SS Cornubia, Harveys built and owned the SS Bride of 1863 and SS Bessie of 1865. However, the two ships could not compete with rail travel for both passengers and freight, and were moved to other trades.

The Hayle to Bristol services reduced and were operated by Hosken, Trevithick, Polkinhorn and Company Ltd of Penzance which bought the screw steamer Norseman in 1893. The Norseman was replaced with the M.J. Hedley, a steam coaster carrying passengers until 1917 on a weekly service linking Bristol, Hayle and Liverpool.

During the previous term, the Country Party had split into rival factions, the Ministerial Country Party (MCP) which comprised the bulk of the parliamentary party—many of whom had switched allegiance from other parties since 1919—and the Executive Country Party (ECP), which was loyal to the Primary Producers' Association, which the Country Party was intended to represent in Parliament. After the 1924 election, which significantly strengthened the latter at the expense of the former, the Ministerial arm merged with the Nationalist Party, as did the National Labor Party, which lost most of its representation in the election.

Notes
 Following the 1924 state election a new Ministry consisting of six members, including one Member of the Legislative Council, was appointed. These members were therefore required to resign and contest ministerial by-elections on 1 May 1924, at which all were returned unopposed.
 On 23 February 1925, the Labor member for Forrest, John Holman, died. The Labor candidate and daughter of the deceased, May Holman, was elected unopposed on 3 April 1925.

It is known from a partial skeleton and skull found in rocks of the Late Triassic (Norian-age) Los Colorados Formation of the Ischigualasto-Villa Unión Basin in northwestern Argentina.

History and description 
Pseudhesperosuchus is based on PVL 3830.  This specimen consists of a skull and lower jaws, most of the vertebral column, the shoulder girdle, and parts of the arms and legs.  The genus was named by José Bonaparte in 1969.  The type species is P. jachaleri. The skull, though nearly complete, is poorly preserved, and some of its bones and sutures have been misidentified over the years. A 2002 phylogenetic analysis of sphenosuchians performed by James Clark and Hans–Dieter Sues found Pseudhesperosuchus to have an unresolved position along with several other sphenosuchians, neither closer to true crocodiles or to Sphenosuchus. The genus is sometimes misspelled Pseudohesperosuchus, as in Carroll (1988).

Initially the only available formula recommended was made by Mead Johnson. Others, including Albumaid XP, Cymogran, and Minafen, have since been developed in Britain. Medical texts often recommend Lofenalac.

Lofenalac can be rather expensive to purchase and few retailers stock it. The taste and smell has been described by adult users as ""medical"" and offensive, although infants do not mind the flavor and children often consume it without complaint for some years.

The film follows two young Afghan refugees, Jamal Udin Torabi and Enayatullah, as they leave a refugee camp in Pakistan for a better life in London. Since their journey is illegal, it is fraught with danger, and they must use back-channels, bribes, and smugglers to achieve their goal.

The film won the Golden Bear prize at the 2003 Berlin International Film Festival and BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language at the 57th British Academy Film Awards the film was nominated for Alexander Korda Award for Best British Film but lost to Touching the Void (directed by The Last King of Scotland director Kevin Macdonald).

Plot
Jamal and Enayatullah are Afghan refugees in a camp in Peshawar, Pakistan. They travel to Quetta, and thence to Taftan on the Iranian border. They pay people smugglers to assist them over the border; on their first attempt they are stopped by Iranian police and returned to Pakistan, but their second attempt is successful. They travel to Tehran and then to Maku, in the Kurdish part of Iran, from where they cross a mountain range on foot to Turkey. In Istanbul they meet a group of other migrants, and they are taken to Italy inside a shipping container. The container is not ventilated, and most of the refugees, including Enayatullah, are suffocated to death. Jamal survives and lives in Italy for a time. He then steals a woman's purse and buys a rail ticket to Paris. From there, he goes to the Sangatte asylum seekers camp and with a new friend, Yusef, he crosses the English Channel by stowing away on a lorry. Finally, he arrives in London, where he calls his uncle to say he has arrived but that Enyatullah is ""not in this world"". The film ends with images of the Peshawar refugees.

Production and style
The film is shot in a documentary style but it is in fact a drama performed by non-professional actors and with improvised dialogue. The actors are mostly playing fictionalised versions of themselves; for example, Jamal is a real Afghan refugee and the Iranian policeman who deports the two refugees back to Pakistan is played by a real policeman who is re-enacting his normal work for the camera. Enayatullah was a market trader whom the filmmakers cast because they thought him ""a nice guy"". The production team lied to authorities in several countries in order to secure filming rights, having met government resistance in Iran and Pakistan. Most of the film was shot on location, but the scenes inside the Sangatte camp were actually filmed in England, as the film crew received hostility from the French inhabitants of the nearby village.

Distribution
The film was released in the UK in March 2003 by the BBC after festival screenings in 2002. It was released in the United States in a limited number of cities in September 2003 by Lions Gate as part of the short-lived Sundance Film Series partnership experiment with Loews Cineplex Entertainment. The film did not make much money, but was highly regarded by the critics that were able to see it. The film holds an 89% on Rotten Tomatoes.

Aftermath
In a case of life imitating art, after returning to Pakistan, Jamal Udin Torabi made the journey to London in reality and applied for asylum. He lived with a family in South East London, although he was only granted leave to remain in the UK until his eighteenth birthday. Enayatullah used the money he earned on the film to buy a truck, and now runs an import-export business between Kabul and Peshawar.

History
The building was designed by the neoclassical architect Juan de Villanueva for the use of the heir to the Spanish throne Charles, Prince of Asturias.  Construction began in 1784.

Villanueva had previously designed another building known as the Casita del Príncipe for the same client at El Escorial.  The word casita is the diminutive of the Spanish word for ""house"".  Such buildings gave their royal occupants the opportunity to escape some of the formalities of court life.  The Petit Trianon at Versailles offers a French example of the phenomenon.

The building is administered by the Patrimonio Nacional. Following restoration work in the early twenty-first century, the building is open to the public by prior arrangement. The artwork inside includes a fresco by Francisco Bayeu y Subías.

There is a mysterious connection between Dr. Wyatt and Eli's parents, and all Eli knows about the connection is that it has something to do with his mother, who has Huntington's disease.  Because of the connection between Dr. Wyatt and the Samuels family, Eli's father is strongly against Eli working there.  The job is perfect, and the wages are great, but Eli can't help but notice that Dr. Wyatt seems to be a little too interested in him.  Later on, as Eli continues to work in the lab, he discovers with the help of Kayla Matheson, Dr. Wyatt's supposed ""niece,"" that he and Kayla are the product of a highly unethical eugenics experiment.

Characters
 Eli Samuels: Eli is 18 years old, 6′9″ (201 centimeters) tall. He's an A student, and is the salutatorian in high school. His mother has Huntington's disease, which he could have too.
 Jonathan Samuels: Jonathan Samuels is Eli's father, who loved his wife. He has a problem with Eli working at Wyatt Transgenic's, because of things that went down in the past. He is initially completely unwilling to tell Eli anything about his mother's relationships with Dr. Wyatt.
 Dr. Quincy Wyatt: Dr. Quincy Wyatt is a famed geneticist, who is considered to be on par with Mendel, Watson, and Crick. He offers Eli a job. He displays an unexplained interest in Eli.
 Vivian Fadiman: Vivian Fadiman is Eli's girlfriend and Valedictorian at his high school. All she wants is to be part of his life and she supports him in everything he does. It's hard for her to understand why Eli hides major parts of his life from her. Eli is devoted to her, though they do go through some rough times.
 Kayla Matheson: A year older than Eli, he gets to know her via Dr. Wyatt. He is attracted to her because of her beauty and athleticism.
 Ava Samuels: Ava Samuels was Eli's mother and lived in a nursing home because of her Huntington's disease. She had a mysterious connection with Dr. Wyatt.

Themes
The story addresses a lot of recent scientific breakthroughs, and uses them as plot devices.  For instance, The Human Genome Project, which documents all the genes and DNA in the human genetic makeup, is talked about when Dr. Wyatt explains his genetic testing to Eli for the first time.  Scientific American recently published an article detailing the possible uses for the information gathered from the Human Genome Project.  Modern advancements in gene studies currently can detect and, in some cases, even predict the presence of a genetic abnormality.  In Double Helix, this ability to detect flaws before birth was used to genetically engineer a “more perfect son, devoid of flaws and with a proper chance to live free of Huntington’s.”

For some people, the biggest issue with genetic engineering is whether or not to seek out and act on knowledge about genetic flaws. Double Helix attempts to explore the life saving and life destroying aspects of genetic engineering. The book proposes that, while Eli's life was saved by avoiding the Huntington's disease gene, his concept of life and self were destroyed when he found out he was genetically engineered to be a certain way.

""', 'The subtitle used by theed composer in this movement reads : "" Death and life fight a strange struggle .', 'He saith , My fathered , I am risen , and I am with thee . ""']","Les Corps Glorieux is a large organ cycle composed in the summer of 1939 in Saint-Théoffrey (Isère) by Olivier Messiaen. The work was completed on 25 August 1939, a week before the declaration of the Second World War and was premiered by Messiaen himself on 15 April 1945 at the Palais de Chaillot. This work marks an evolution in the musical language of Olivier Messiaen, combining features of both Indian classical music and Gregorian chant. The work, together with L'Ascension (1934) and La Nativité du Seigneur (1935), is one of the three early organ cycles of the composer.

Structure
Les Corps Glorieux is divided into seven movements:

1. Subtilité des Corps Glorieux
This movement is a single unharmonised melody based on a Gregorian antiphon. Each end of a phrase is repeated as an echo. Cornet registrations alternate between the Grand-Orgue, Positif and Récit manuals. The unchanging monophony of this movement, the simplest and purest musical form, symbolises the ""subtilité"".

The subtitle of this movement, added by the composer, reads translated: ""An earthly body is being sown, a spiritual body is raised."" (1 Corinthians 15:44) ""And they shall be as the angels of God in heaven."" (Matthew 22:30)

2. Les eaux de la Grâce
The ""Waters of grace"" are symbolised here by a 4' ostinato in the pedal, which is simultaneously played in diminution by the left hand, while in the right hand a harmonized melody is heard. The octave doubling of this melody by the 16' register gives an unusual effect. After 29 bars, the movement breaks without a real conclusion - the melody could be carried on to infinity.

The subtitle of this sentence reads: ""The Lamb in the midst of the throne will lead the chosen to the waters of life."" (Revelation John 7:17)

3. L'ange aux parfums
The texture in this movement is wide-ranging, from simple monophony to complicated counterpoint . At the beginning of the second part of the movement, a unison melody acts as a cantus firmus . In a following, fast section, the ascent of the incense is symbolised through fast semiquaver runs. These runs abruptly cut short to end the movement.

The subtitle of this movement reads: ""The fragrance of incense rose up to God with the prayers of the saints from the hand of the angel."" (Revelation 8: 4)

4. Combat de Mort et de la Vie
This is the longest set of the cycle. Death initially embodies an aggressive toccata over a powerful low motif, after which life is represented by a quiet, meditative second half.

The subtitle used by the composer in this movement reads: ""Death and life fought a strange struggle. Though dead, the prince of life is victorious and reigns. He saith, My father, I am risen, and I am with thee."" (from the Sequence and Introitus of the Easter festival)

5. Force et agilité des Corps Glorieux
In this movement the main motif consists of a brief glissando followed by a staccato quaver chain on a single note,in octaves.

The subtitle of this movement reads: ""A weak body is sown, a powerful body is raised"" (1 Corinthians 15:43)

6. Joie et clarté des Corps Glorieux
A unison, rhapsodic theme in the upper voice, interrupted by three chords played in the récit, is heard at the beginning of the movement over a receding fifth in the pedal. This is followed by a quieter middle section, in which the cromorne of the Positif and the Hautbois of the Récite correspond. The main and middle sections alternate with each other, followed by the coda, which shows the main part rhythmically slightly changed. The so-called ""Freudenmotiv"" then breaks off spectacularly and the movement ends with a virtuosic glissando.

The subtitle of this movement reads: ""Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their father."" (Matthew 13:43)

7. Le Mystère de la Sainte-Trinité
In contrast to Messiaen's "" La Nativité du Seigneur "" organ cycle, ""Les Corps Glorieux"" has a calm and meditative ending. The holy Trinity is symbolised by the three-part counterpoint of the movement. Contrasting stop registrations (32 'in the pedal against 16' and 2 'in the Récit) dominate this movement, which may be regarded as a precursor (not in style but in subject) to the organ-cycle Méditations sur le Mystère de la Sainte Trinité.

The subtitle of this movement reads: ""Almighty Father. With your only Son and Holy Spirit, you are a God. Not in the uniqueness of a person, but in the Trinity of a Being. ""(from the Preface to the Sunday Trinitatis)

It is named after Sgt. Joshua Eaton, the only Reading casualty in the American Revolutionary War. The school is located at the corner of Summer Avenue and Oak Street, close to the site of Joshua Eaton's family home. In 1944, Dr. William K. Wilson, supervisor of educational planning of school buildings for the New York State Education Department, was hired to study the Reading school system. One of his observations was that an elementary school was needed in the area of Prescott Street, Main Street and the railroad tracks. His recommendation was that the school should plan to accommodate 500 children from kindergarten through grade six. When Joshua Eaton opened in 1949, it housed grades 1–6. Today, it houses around 450 children in kindergarten through fifth grade. The building was designed by reading architect George Sidebottom. The original building consisted of 18 classrooms, an auditorium, cafeteria and gymnasium. At that time, the school was chosen as the best-designed elementary school building in the nation (38,000 blueprints were submitted). Joshua Eaton was dedicated on Sunday, October 23, 1949.

The Joseph Raphael De Lamar House is a mansion at 233 Madison Avenue at the corner of 37th Street in the Murray Hill neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City. The house, currently the Consulate General of Poland, New York City, was built in 1902–1905 and was designed by C. P. H. Gilbert in the Beaux-Arts style. The De Lamar Mansion marked a stark departure from Gilbert's traditional style of French Gothic architecture and was instead robustly Beaux-Arts, heavy with rusticated stonework, balconies, and a colossal mansard roof. The mansion is the largest in Murray Hill, and one of the most spectacular in the city; the interiors are as lavish as the exterior.

History 
Joseph Raphael De Lamar was a Dutch-born merchant seaman who made his first fortune in mining and metallurgy during the 1870s-80s silver-lead rushes to Colorado and Idaho, and 1890s gold strikes at Mercur, Utah and Delamar, Nevada. He had this residence built as his entrée into New York society. It was to be a family residence, but soon after it was built De Lamar and his wife divorced. The 1910 census taker found De Lamar in residence with his daughter Alice, by then 15, and nine servants, a typical ratio for the time. De Lamar died eight years later in 1918 at the age of 75. His obituary in The Boston Daily Globe described him as a ""man of mystery"" and an accomplished organist. He left an estate worth $29 million (equal to $ in ) to his daughter, who continued living in the house for a short time before moving to an apartment at 740 Park Avenue.

The mansion was sold to the American Bible Society. In 1923 the National Democratic Club purchased it for its headquarters. 

In 1973, the Republic of Poland bought the mansion for $900,000 (equal to $ in ) to house its Consulate General in New York. The interior has been thoroughly cleaned and renovated and retains all of its many period features. Since 2008 the consulate has also been regularly illuminated at night.

The De Lamar Mansion was designated a landmark by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1975, and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.

In the 1978–79 season it played first-class cricket in the Texaco Cup. 

Tobago played their first match in 1957–58, a one-day match against the touring Pakistanis. Over the next 15 years several international teams played Tobago. All the matches took place at the Shaw Park ground in Scarborough. In 1964–65, in another one-day match, Tobago dismissed the touring Australians for 142 and in response made 145 after being 84 for 8. 

For the 1978–79 season the first-class Texaco Cup was expanded to include Tobago as well as the four regional Trinidad sides that had competed in 1977–78. None of the Tobago players had played first-class cricket before. Tobago drew their first match, then lost their next three, two of them by an innings. They finished at the bottom of the table. All four matches were played on the Trinidad mainland. The leading wicket-taker was Alston Daniel, with 11 wickets at an average of 29.00; he later played for Trinidad and Tobago. The captain was Isaac Benjamin.

The Texaco Cup lost its first-class status after 1978–79. Tobago were scheduled to compete in 1979–80 but did not play any of their matches.

Early life
H. Henry Baxter, the son of Judge Henry Baxter, was born in Saxtons River, Vermont on January 8, 1818.  He attended schools in Windham and Windsor Counties and at age 15 he became a clerk in a Boston dry goods commission warehouse.  He worked in Boston for two years and became a supervisor of employees as the warehouse's head bookkeeper.

In the mid-1830s Baxter returned to Vermont, after securing the financing to open his own dry goods store in Bellows Falls.  Having extended credit to his customers during the Panic of 1837, Baxter did not receive timely repayment.  He closed the store when he was unable to run it profitably.

Business career
Despite bouts of ill health usually caused by overwork, Baxter was a large man with commanding presence.  Drawing on these traits and his experience managing employees in Boston, in the early 1840s Baxter bid successfully for the contract to grade rail bed and lay track for the Rutland and Burlington Railroad.  Baxter personally supervised his workers, and completed the Rutland and Burlington contract successfully.  His success led to construction work for other railroads, including the Western Vermont and Cleveland and Toledo.  Baxter then settled in Rutland and purchased the Rutland Marble Company.  Baxter operated Rutland Marble in partnership with his brother John N. Baxter and Charles Clement and Sons, which included Percival W. Clement.  Rutland Marble employed Redfield Proctor as Manager.

Baxter operated a farm on Creek Road.  Baxter called his farm Maple Grove, and raised cattle, sheep and thoroughbred horses.  Baxter also constructed a mansion at Maple Grove, which he called Grove Hall.  After his death his home was operated as the Crestwood Hotel until it was demolished in 1945.

Military career
Having served as a Captain in a militia unit called the Rutland Light Guards, in 1859 Baxter was appointed Adjutant General of the Vermont Militia, and was succeeded as company commander by William Y. W. Ripley.  He took steps to prepare the militia in anticipation of the Civil War, and also served as a Delegate to the Peace Conference that attempted to prevent the conflict.

After the war started Baxter was responsible for recruiting the 1st Vermont Infantry, a regiment enlisted for three months' service.  Baxter used his own funds to ensure that 1st Vermont soldiers were equipped and paid prior to departing for service in the Washington, D.C. area, and rode at the head of the regiment as it departed Vermont.

In 1861 he relinquished the Adjutant General's position in favor of someone with combat experience, and was succeeded by Peter T. Washburn, who had been the Lieutenant Colonel of the 1st Vermont and its de facto commander.

Later career
After leaving the Adjutant General's post Baxter returned to his business interests.  He sold the Rutland Marble Company to Proctor, and pursued several other opportunities, including founding the Rutland County Bank.

After selling Rutland Marble Baxter resided in New York City and Rutland.  An associate of Cornelius Vanderbilt, he was a major investor in the New York Central Railroad, serving as President from 1867 to 1869, and a member of the board of directors from 1869 until his death.  In 1870 he incorporated Rutland's Baxter National Bank, of which he was President until his death.

In addition to his business association with Cornelius Vanderbilt, Baxter sometimes partnered with Trenor W. Park.  Baxter's other holdings included large ownership stakes in and/or board of directors memberships with: the Chicago & North Western Railroad; Emma Silver Mine; Pacific Mail Steamship Company; Hannibal & St. Joseph Railroad; Panama Canal Railway; Continental Bank of New York City; and the Pullman Palace Car Company.  He also owned a construction company which built most of New York City's elevated railway, and was the primary investor in Rutland's gas lighting company.

Death and burial
Baxter was in increasingly poor health in his later years, especially after an 1877 fall left him with a debilitating back injury.  He was often bedridden, but continued to actively manage his investments until his death in New York City on February 17, 1884.  He was buried in Rutland's Evergreen Cemetery.

Family

In 1841 Baxter married Eliza Wales of Bellows Falls.  They had no children, and Eliza died in 1849.  In 1851 Baxter married Mary Roberts of Manchester, Vermont.  They had two sons, Henry (1856-1860) and Hugh (1862-1945).  Hugh Baxter was one of America's first well-known pole vaulters.  He held the national title from 1883 to 1886, and set a world record of 11' 1/2"" in 1883.  He was beaten only once during his pole vaulting career, which continued until 1895.

H. Henry Baxter's brother Algernon Sidney Baxter (1819-1897) was a successful businessman in St. Louis, Missouri and New York City.  An acquaintance of Ulysses S. Grant from Grant's time as a resident of St. Louis, A. Sidney Baxter served on Grant's staff as a Captain of Quartermasters from 1861 to 1862, resigning because of illness shortly after the Battle of Shiloh.

Legacy
The Gaysvile, Vermont Grand Army of the Republic post was named for him.

Baxter's family contributed to construction of the H. H. Baxter Memorial Library, a landmark which now serves as Rutland's Jewish Center.  The Baxter Library was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.

Along with Arthur R. M. Lower and Donald Creighton he is regarded as one of the dominant Canadian historians of his generation.

Biography 
Morton was born on 13 December 1908 in Gladstone, Manitoba. He won a Rhodes Scholarship and attended the University of Oxford, where he studied history.  He returned to Canada to teach at Brandon College, the University of Manitoba, and then at Trent University. W. L. Morton served as head of the Department of History and Provost of University College of the University of Manitoba. He helped initiate the Canadian Centenary Series project and served as the Executive Editor for the nineteen-volume authoritative history of Canada. He served as President of the Canadian Historical Association from 1959 to 1960. Morton was one of the most prominent early faculty members of Trent University at Peterborough, Ontario, and was the first Master of the university's Champlain College.

Morton was a strong supporter of the Progressive Conservative Party and was very much a Red Tory. In 1969, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada ""for his contributions as an historian, teacher and author of several books on Canadian History.""

Morton was a passionate nationalist and a conservative who fought against the liberal ideas that dominated Canadian thought after 1960, when the younger generation focused more on race, class, and gender as opposed to the national themes that intrigued Morton.

Morton died on 7 December 1980 in Medicine Hat, Alberta.

San Jose State

Arizona State

A blocked PAT was the difference in a crazy game in Camp Randall Stadium. Both Arizona State and Wisconsin were undefeated heading into this game, Arizona State having beaten a pair of FCS teams and Wisconsin having beaten UNLV and San Jose State. The Badgers managed to overcome a sluggish start and fended off an upset bid by the Sun Devils.

Arizona State would be marred by mistakes, committing multiple penalties on offense and defense, and Wisconsin used Arizona State's gaffes to keep themselves in the game. The Sun Devils returned a kick for a touchdown, had a very long runback on a kick to end the half (the returner was tackled inside the one-yard line as time expired), and had a punt return for a touchdown called back due to a pair of illegal blocks. Wisconsin did not commit a single turnover, and that would ultimately help to decide this game.

Wisconsin improved to 3–0 on the season, and faces FCS opponent Austin Peay next week. Arizona State, however, falls to 2–1 and will need to win 5 Pac-10 games to become bowl-eligible.

Austin Peay

Wisconsin broke the all-time record for most points scored with 70, breaking a record from the 1962 season (the Badgers defeated New Mexico State 69–13 that season).

Michigan State

In a matchup between undefeated teams in the Big Ten, Michigan State prevailed over the 9th ranked Badgers. Despite 3 Spartan turnovers, the Badgers were unable to come away with a road win, dropping head coach Bret Bielema to 0–2 in Spartan Stadium and 2–2 against Michigan State overall. The Spartans face their rival, the Michigan Wolverines in a crucial road contest next week, while the Badgers face longtime rival Minnesota in the battle for Paul Bunyan's Axe.

Minnesota

Wisconsin won a school-record 7th straight game over the rival Golden Gophers, dropping Tim Brewster to 0–4 against Wisconsin and improving Bret Bielema to 5–0 against Minnesota. Wisconsin did not commit a turnover for the 4th game in a row, and had two running backs with over 100 yards rushing (James White and John Clay). Minnesota has now lost 5 straight games after winning their opener against Middle Tennessee State.

Ohio State

Wisconsin stunned the top-ranked Buckeyes 31–18, their first upset of a top-ranked team since a 1981 defeat of #1 ranked Michigan. Wisconsin Senior WR David Gilreath returned the opening kick of the game for a touchdown, RB John Clay became the first running back to go over 100 yards rushing against the Buckeyes since Joe McKnight of USC in 2008, and Wisconsin's defense harried Ohio State QB Terrelle Pryor all game long. The Badgers ran up 21 unanswered points in the first half before Devin Barclay of Ohio State answered with a field goal. The Buckeyes managed to get 15 more points (via a pair of Daniel Herron touchdown runs) but the Badgers iced their incredible upset of the Buckeyes with a TD run by James White and a Philip Welch field goal. The win over Ohio State is Bret Bielema's first; he was 0–3 against the Buckeyes in the previous three meetings (2007, 2008, and 2009). The loss dropped Jim Tressel to 4–4 against Wisconsin and snapped a 3-game Buckeye winning streak over the Badgers.

Iowa

11th ranked Wisconsin won a narrow 31–30 contest over the Iowa Hawkeyes. The Hawkeyes went into the half with a 13–10 lead, but the Badgers chipped away at it and took a 24–20 lead. The Hawkeyes managed a touchdown and field goal of their own to take a 30–24 lead in the 4th quarter. However, the Badgers scored the go-ahead touchdown on an 8-yard run by running back Montee Ball. With under a minute remaining, Iowa drove into Wisconsin territory on their final possession, but Iowa RB Adam Robinson was tackled before he could get out of bounds. Unable to stop the clock, Iowa ran out of time, giving Wisconsin head coach Bret Bielema his first-ever road win over a ranked opponent. It was also his 3rd win over Iowa and 2nd in Iowa City, breaking a two-game Hawkeye winning streak.

Purdue

Wisconsin traveled to West Lafayette to play the Purdue Boilermakers. Purdue entered the game on a two-game losing streak (losing 49–0 at Ohio State and 44–10 at Illinois), but managed to take a 10–3 lead on the Badgers before the end of the first half. An interception by Badger QB Scott Tolzien on Wisconsin's first possession of the game and a missed field goal by Wisconsin K Philip Welch helped the Boilermakers take a 10–6 lead at the half.

From there, Wisconsin took command of the game. Purdue Freshman QB Sean Robinson threw an interception on the first possession of the half that set the Badgers up with excellent field position. Badger QB Scott Tolzien capitalized on the turnover, finding freshman WR Jared Abbrederis on a 7-yard touchdown strike that gave the Badgers their first lead of the game at 13–10. After an exchange of punts, the Badgers again found the end zone on a 31-yard touchdown run by RB Montee Ball, extending their lead to 20–10. Purdue K Carson Wiggs tightened the game by kicking a field goal to cut the Badger lead 20–13. However, those would be the last points of the game for the Boilermakers. Wisconsin would get another touchdown run from Ball and an interception returned for a touchdown by CB Antonio Fenelus.

The Badgers won their fifth straight game over Purdue, and their 8th game of the season overall. They play Indiana in Camp Randall on November 13. After a 2–0 start to conference play, Purdue has lost their last three games. They play Michigan in West Lafayette, having won their last two games against the Wolverines.

Indiana

Wisconsin did not punt on any of their offensive possessions, tallied a pair of 100-yard running backs (James White and Montee Ball) and overpowered the Indiana Hoosiers. At one point, the score was 10–10, but Wisconsin would score 7 consecutive touchdowns to take a 59–10 lead before Indiana managed to kick a field goal. The Badgers put in their backup players in the 4th Quarter, but their two backup quarterbacks (Jon Budmayr and Nate Tice) managed to score a pair of touchdowns anyway.

Badger QB Scott Tolzien completed 15 passes on 18 attempts with a trio of touchdown strikes. Montee Ball's 167 rushing yards and 3 rushing touchdowns on 22 carries led Wisconsin's ground game, and his teammate James White (who had not played against Purdue with a head injury) ran for 144 yards on 19 carries with two touchdowns of his own. Wisconsin S Aaron Henry returned an interception for a touchdown late in the game to put Wisconsin up by a commanding margin and icing their win over the Hoosiers.

Wisconsin's 83 points against Indiana easily broke their previous record 70 points scored against Austin Peay, which was set earlier this season. They play Michigan in Ann Arbor next week.

Wisconsin would lead from start to finish of this game, shutting out the powerful Michigan Wolverine offense in the first half. The Badgers incredibly gained 380 yards of total offense in the first half. Wisconsin would close out the Wolverines from there; Michigan managed to cut Wisconsin's lead to just 10 points with a pair of back to back touchdowns. However, Wisconsin answered with a touchdown of its own. Michigan would score another 3rd-quarter touchdown, but the 4th quarter was where the Badgers took this game, outscoring the Wolverines 17–7 in the final 15:00.

Wisconsin running back Montee Ball ran for 4 touchdowns on 30 carries; his 194 yards paced a powerful Badger rushing attack. Badger QB Scott Tolzien completed 14 passes on 15 attempts for 201 yards as the Badgers diced up Michigan's vulnerable secondary. Wisconsin RB James White would run for 161 yards of his own and a pair of touchdowns; he and Ball combined for 6 rushing touchdowns and well over 300 yards of total offense.

Denard Robinson became the first QB to run for over 1,500 yards in a season, but he was unable to spark the Wolverines to a possible upset of a top ten Wisconsin team.

With the 48–28 win, Wisconsin won in Michigan Stadium for the first time since the 1994 season (when they defeated Michigan 31–19). Wisconsin also scored more points in the game than they had ever scored in any single game against the Wolverines prior to this date. The 10–1 Badgers are now looking at a potential Rose Bowl berth and BCS game, but must play a still-dangerous Northwestern Wildcats team in Camp Randall next weekend.

Northwestern

Wisconsin led by double digits just minutes into the game and never let go, blowing out the Wildcats en route to their eleventh victory of the season. Aided by 7 Northwestern turnovers, the Badgers played some of their best football of the season on Senior Day.

Wisconsin QB Scott Tolzien, who led the nation in passing completion percentage (74.3%) in the regular season, had an excellent game in his final home start. He completed 15 passes on 19 attempts for 230 yards with 4 touchdown passes. Tolzien was not sacked once in the game, and left to a standing ovation.

Wisconsin's running back duo of Montee Ball and James White tore apart Northwestern's defense on the ground, with 300+ combined rushing yards. James White eclipsed the 1,000 yards rushing mark for the season. Montee Ball's 4 touchdown runs paced the Badger ground game and he ran 20 times for 178 yards on the day.

The powerful Badger offensive line had one of its best games of the season, opening holes for the running game and protecting Scott Tolzien. Bill Nagy, John Moffitt, and Gabe Carimi put together fantastic games in their final home start. Badger TE Lance Kendricks caught 4 passes for 80 yards with an acrobatic touchdown catch, and WR David Gilreath scored his only receiving touchdown in the regular season on an 18-yard strike from Tolzien. Nick Toon caught a pair of touchdown passes as well.

Due to wins by Ohio State (over Michigan) and Michigan State (over Penn State), Wisconsin's win over Northwestern resulted in a tie between the teams with a 7–1 overall record. The Big Ten championship is thus split amongst the three teams, with the highest ranked team in the BCS going to the Rose Bowl.

TCU–Rose Bowl

Both teams scored double digit points in the first quarter, a Rose Bowl record. The game was close throughout, and was not decided until Wisconsin failed to convert a two-point conversion late in the fourth quarter to tie the game. It was the second time the game was decided by two points, joining the 1966 game (UCLA 14, Michigan State 12).

The policy of unpromising villages' liquidation included the resettlement of the residents to larger rural settlements with concentration of the bulk of the rural population, production and social facilities. The most negative social impact of this policy was the significant damage done to rural infrastructure.

Planning 
For the first time, the concept of ""unpromising villages"" was used in recommendations for the design of rural settlements. The recommendations were drawn up in 1960 by the Academy of Civil Engineering and Architecture of the USSR in accordance with the decisions of the Plenum of the Central Committee of the CPSU of December 1959 on the development of new schemes of ""regional and intra-economic planning"" in rural areas. According to this document, rural settlements were subdivided into two groups depending on what was their population size, how well they were provided with communications and to what extent they corresponded to the conditions of the economic development: ""promising"", the population of which was at least 1-1.5 thousand people and ""unpromising"" with a correspondingly smaller population.

The initiators of this policy proceeded from the principle that highly concentrated forms of settlement should correspond to highly mechanized agriculture. According to the plans, each kolkhoz (collective farm) or sovkhoz (state farm) was to include one or two posyoloks with a population ranging from 1-2 to 5-10 thousand people. A clear definition of ""promising villages"" was introduced, in which it was planned to relocate residents of smaller ""unpromising villages"" (which included up to 80% of their total number). It was assumed that this change in the settlement structure contributes to the better development of the socio-cultural and everyday life of the rural areas of the Soviet Union, bringing it closer to urban standards, as well as reducing the flow of migration to the cities.

It was originally planned that by 1979 the number of rural settlements will decrease from 705 thousand to 115 thousand. Subsequently, in the process these numbers were constantly adjusted. On 20 March 1974, resolutions of the Central Committee of the CPSU and the Council of Ministers of the USSR were issued, according to which out of 143 thousand settlements in the Non-Black Earth zone, 114 thousand were to be liquidated, 170 thousand families were planned to be relocated to ""comfortable kolkhoz/sovkhoz settlements"", as well as to provide them with significant benefits and loans for individual construction there.

Implementation 
In the early stages of the project, the policy of liquidation of settlements was limited. Mostly it boiled down to the revision and re-registration of rural settlements, the design of the territorial and economic organization of the districts. Since 1968, repair works and construction were no longer carried out in settlements declared ""unpromising"", objects of social infrastructure (schools, shops, rural clubs and other facilities) were closed and transport links were limited. These conditions forced people to migrate.

The destruction of unpromising villages was not accompanied by the same active transformation of “promising” ones. The improvement and expansion of individual housing in the central estate (settlement where the administrative center of a kolkhoz or sovkhoz was located), was carried out with a constant lack of resources. Often, apartment blocks of urban type were provided for resettlement. Two-thirds of the settlers migrated not to ""promising"" rural settlements, but to regional centers, big cities and other regions of the country. The liquidation of ""unpromising"" settlements was carried out without taking into account the wishes of the inhabitants. Some residents perceived the resettlement negatively.

Results 
The reorganization was not fully implemented: there were liquidated less unpromising villages than planned. Nevertheless, the settlement network has undergone significant changes. Over the period of 1959–79, the number of rural settlements in Russia decreased by 60.2% to 177.1 thousand, in the USSR as a whole by 54.3%, up to 383.1 thousand. Most of the resettlement actions took place in the Non-Black Earth zone.

Effect 
The liquidation of unpromising villages failed to reach the initial plans and had negative socio-economic consequences for the numerous northwestern and central regions of Russia, as well as Ural and Siberia. Important aspects of the rural life were not taken into account, first of all, connection of the resettled people with their personal household plots. The liquidation of small settlements led to the desolation of adjacent agricultural lands. The concentration process caused an increase in migration to major urban centers, leading to a population drop in the regions affected by the reform and demographic aging of the Russian countryside.

Public controversy unfolded on this issue. The unpromising villages liquidation program was criticized by demographer  and writers such as Vasily Belov, Fyodor Abramov, Valentin Rasputin, commonly known as members of Village Prose literary movement.

In 1980, by the decision of the Gosstroy's Committee for Civil Engineering and Architecture, the division of rural settlements into ""promising"" and ""unpromising"" was canceled. Nevertheless, the erosion of the rural settlement network had not stopped and small villages continued to become abandoned.

She is the maternal half-sister of Barbra Streisand. She has been performing on Broadway and other venues since her teenage years.

Early life

Kind was born in 1951. Her parents were Louis Kind and Diana Rosen Streisand Kind. They divorced when Roslyn was six. She was brought up in the Conservative movement of Judaism, going to temple and Yeshivah as a child.

Career
Kind's inspiration for being a singer came from her grandfather, who was a cantor, and her mother, a former opera singer. Kind recorded her debut album two months after graduating from high school in June 1968. The album, titled ""Give Me You,"" was released in January 1969, at the same time as her first professional performance, at the Hungry I in San Francisco.

Kind's New York debut was at the Plaza Hotel's Persian Room in 1969, where she played to a packed house that included her half-sister, Barbra Streisand. She performed on the April 16, 1977, episode of Saturday Night Live, which was hosted by Barbra Streisand's ex-husband Elliott Gould.

Kind has spent the past several decades touring internationally as a cabaret singer and entertainer. She was featured in Barbra Streisand's 2012 national tour, Back to Brooklyn, and 2013 European tour, Barbra Streisand LIVE, during which she sang a duet with her half-sister. A few of Kind's shows are directed by Barbra Streisand's concert director, Richard Jay Alexander.

Kind released her new single, ""Light of Love"", on January 17, 2020.

It is 13 km southeast of Mainz, and 8 km south of Rüsselsheim.

Geography

Location
Trebur is located in the Frankfurt Rhein-Main Region. The cities of Mainz, Wiesbaden, Frankfurt am Main, and Darmstadt are located within 30 km of Trebur.

Neighbouring communities
Trebur borders in the North upon the community of Ginsheim-Gustavsburg and the town of Rüsselsheim, in the East upon the community of Nauheim and the town of Groß-Gerau, in the South upon the town of Riedstadt, and in the West upon the town of Oppenheim and the communities of Nierstein, Nackenheim and Bodenheim (all four in Mainz-Bingen).

Constituent communities
Trebur consists of the four communities of Astheim, Geinsheim, Hessenaue and Trebur, as well as the rural area of Kornsand, and is home to some 13,000 inhabitants in 3,500 households.

History
Trebur's first documentary mention came in 829 in one of King Louis the Pious's documents. Since the 9th century, a Pfalz, or Imperial Palace, has stood in Trebur. It arose from a royal court with an extensive taxation region, to which belonged, among other places, the constituent community of Astheim. Between 829 and 1077, 57 kingly stays are known to have taken place, a few of which are notable in the Empire's history. The Council of Tribur was held in this city in May 895. King Henry IV was especially strongly connected to Trebur. He was elected King here in 1053, and he also wed here in 1066. In 1076 he was forced by opposing princes at the Fürstentag in Trebur to settle his conflict with the Pope, which gave rise to Henry's ""Walk to Canossa"".

Trebur subsequently lost its importance as a royal court. Other than the anti-king (Gegenkönig) Rudolf of Rheinfeld, no other king ever visited the Pfalz again. Together with the Pfalz, Trebur was pledged to the County of Katzenelnbogen in 1248. The pledge was never honoured, and the Counts managed to acquire further sovereign rights in 1422. The Katzenelnbogen inheritance passed along with Trebur to the Landgraviate of Hesse in 1479.

Together with Astheim and Geinsheim, Trebur became part of the Hessian Amt of Dornberg, from which arose in 1932 the Groß-Gerau district.

Politics

Coat of arms
The charge in Trebur's civic coat of arms is a symbol that first appeared on village limit markers in the 18th century, and then on the mayor's chain of office in the next century. Its origin, however, is unknown, although it has been suggested that it might symbolize the local geography, to wit, the meeting of the rivers Rhine, Neckar and Main.

Partnerships
  Verneuil-sur-Avre, France, département of Eure, since 1982

Sundry
In Trebur stands the T1T, which with a 120 cm-diameter mirror is one of Europe's biggest telescopes open to the public. The T1T is run by the Trebur Astronomy Foundation's (Astronomie Stiftung Trebur) Michael Adrian Observatory.

In Trebur begins the Hessian stretch of the Deutsche Fachwerkstraße or ""German Half-Timbered Road"". Actually a series of different roads, it highlights Germany's many examples of half-timbered houses and buildings.

However in 2017 Serracchiani announced her intention not to seek a re-election and the centre-left selected Sergio Bolzonello, former mayor of Pordenone, as the candidate for the presidency. The centre-right coalition choose Massimiliano Fedriga, a member of the Chamber of Deputies for the League and a close ally of Matteo Salvini, as its candidate; while the Five Star Movement's candidate was Alessandro Fraleoni Morgera, a former member of the right-wing party, National Alliance.

""']","The 1929 World Snooker Championship, known at the time as the Professional Championship of Snooker, was a snooker tournament held between 17 December 1928 and 7 March 1929 at various venues in England, with the final taking place from 4 to 7 March 1929 at the Lounge Hall, Nottingham. Defending champion Joe Davis won the title for the third time by defeating Tom Dennis by 19  to 14 in the final, after securing a winning margin at 17–12.

It was the third edition of the World Snooker Championship. The first round match was held at Loughborough Town Hall, and the venue for the semi-finals was Camkin's Hall, Birmingham. The highest  of the tournament was 61, a new championship record, compiled by Davis in the 23rd frame of the final.

Background
Professional English billiards player and billiard hall manager Joe Davis had noticed the increasing popularity of snooker compared to billiards in the 1920s, and with Birmingham-based billiard hall manager Bill Camkin, who had also seen snooker's increasing appeal, persuaded the Billiards Association and Control Council (BACC) to recognise an official professional snooker championship in the 1926–27 season. The inaugural event was won by Davis, who defeated Tom Dennis 20–11 in the final. Originally called the Professional Championship of Snooker, the annual competition was not titled the World Championship until 1935, but the 1927 tournament is now referred to as the first World Snooker Championship.

For the 1928 championship, a qualifying competition had been held to produce a challenger to Davis, the defending champion. In July 1928 the BACC decided to abandon the challenge system that had been employed for both the Billiards Championship and the Professional Snooker Championship. This meant that Davis, the champion, had to play through the 1929 tournament, which was the third staging of the championship.

The closing date for entries for the snooker championship was 15 October 1928. The entry fee was set at five guineas per player (), with a five-guineas sidestake required for each match. Preliminary heats and the semi-finals were to be best of 25 , played over three days, with the final contested over 33 frames across four days. When the conditions for the championship were published, Camkin's Hall in Birmingham was named as the venue for the final. For pre-final matches, the players concerned were to arrange the dates and venues.

Summary
Five players entered the Championship: Joe Davis (Chesterfield), Tom Dennis (Nottingham), Fred Lawrence (Birmingham), Alec Mann (Birmingham) and Kelsall Prince (Loughborough). Lawrence and Mann had to play a first round match, with the winner to meet Davis. Dennis and Prince faced each other in the other semi-final.

The first match played was the semi-final between Dennis and Prince. This was scheduled from 17 to 22 December 1928 at Town Hall, Loughborough, over six evening  rather than across the three sets of afternoon and evening sessions envisaged when the tournament's conditions were announced. There was just one of four frames each evening, with five planned for the final day. The match was close until halfway through the fourth session with Dennis then leading 8–6. However, Dennis then took the next five frames to win the match 13–6. He added the final frame of the evening to leave the score at 14–6 after five sessions. The match did not continue to the planned sixth session and so finished on 21 December.

The first round match and the other semi-final were arranged for the week of 21 to 26 January 1929 at Camkin's Hall, Birmingham. The first round match was on the first three days; the winner to play Davis on the last three days. Both matches were over 25 frames with two sessions of four frames each day. After 13 frames of their match, Lawrence led Mann 10–3 but Mann won the last three frames of the day to close the gap to 10–6. On the final day, Mann continued his run of frames, winning 9 out of 10, to take a 12–11 lead. However, Lawrence won the last two frames to take the match 13–12. A columnist in the March 1929 edition of The Billiard Player magazine praised Mann's  and Lawrence's  play generally, but commented that ""almost atrociously bad technique"" by Mann when attempting to pot the yellow instead of playing for a  in the  lost him the match. The same writer also added that ""the scarcity of the London Press reports in connexion with the Professional Snooker Games ... was freely commented upon in Birmingham.""

In the Birmingham semi-final, Davis obtained a 5–3 lead on the first day, maintaining a two-frame advantage at 9–7 after two days. On the final day Davis won the first two frames but Lawrence took the next two to again close the gap. On the final evening, Davis won the first frame to lead 12–9 but lost the following frame. Davis added the third frame of the evening to secure a 13–10 victory.

Final
At the request of Davis and Dennis, the BACC agreed to change the venue and date of the final from Camkin's Hall in late March. The 33- final was played from 4 to 7 March. Eight frames were played each day, with four frames in the afternoon and four in the evening (five on the final day). The match was held at The Lounge, Shakespeare Street, Nottingham and was refereed by W. Malkinson of Nottingham. Davis led 6–2 after the first day. On the third day, the first frame featured prolonged exchanges of safety play, before a 45 break by Davis. Dennis had an opportunity to win if he completed a , but went  the  and left Davis an easy pot, which he made, to win the frame. The following frame saw Davis's 31 break followed by a 36 break made by Dennis, before Dennis went in-off the . Dennis's potted blue had resulted in a  stroke, the blue was , and Davis potted it from , following that by potting the pink to win the frame. Dennis won the 15th frame by six points, after clearing the last three colours. He added the 16th frame, during which he escaped from a  with a  shot, and potted the pink after Davis had gone in-off. With the frames from the session shared, Davis retained his four frame lead at 10–6.

On day three, Dennis took three of the four frames in the afternoon, but Davis won three in the evening to maintain his four frame advantage. Davis compiled a 61 break in that evening session, potting nine , six  and two blues in the 23rd frame. In the fourth afternoon session, on 7 March, Davis lost the first frame by one point, 56–57, despite making a break of 45. He took the next, aided by a  pot of a . With each player winning a further frame, the session finished with Davis 16–12 ahead. Davis then won the first frame in the evening, with breaks of 33, 24 and 33, to claim the championship by achieving a winning margin at 17–12. The four ""dead"" frames were played, with each player winning two. The Championship Cup was afterwards presented by Tinsley Lindley. Davis's break of 61 was a new championship record, and the only break of over 50 made during the tournament. The secretary of the BACC, A. Stanley Thorn, claimed that ""the event attracted considerable interest in Nottingham, and excellent attendances were present during the four days' play.""

320,['Hunters pray to him beforeed a hunt and pray to the nut god after the hunt .'],"Tapio () is a Finnish forest spirit or god in Finnish mythology. Hunters prayed to him before a hunt and prayed to the nut god after the hunt. His wife is the goddess of the forest, Mielikki. He is the father of Annikki, Tellervo, Nyyrikki (the god of hunting), and Tuulikki. Fitting the Green Man archetype, Tapio has a beard of lichen and eyebrows of moss. 

Mikael Agricola mentions Tapio as a Tavastian god in the prologue to his Finnish translation of the Book of Psalms, .

He lends his name, in the form of Tapiola, to: 

 one of the major urban centres within the city of Espoo outside Helsinki; and 
 an unincorporated community in the US state of Michigan. 

He has appeared various times in songs by Finnish metal bands. For example, in the symphonic metal band Nightwish's song, ""Elvenpath"", he is referred to as ""Tapio, Bear-king, Ruler of the forest"". The name has also been used extensively by the folk metal band Korpiklaani, especially in their album Spirit of the Forest.

Jean Sibelius' tone poem Tapiola (1926) is a depiction of the forest Tapio inhabits.

Composition
Regarding the song, lead vocalist Jonathan Davis says; ""Everyone has someone who hates on you 'cause you have something they want. It's really, like, the first empowering song I've ever written. The lyrics are: 'You can’t bring me down/I've already had my life turned upside down/I ride a downward spiral round and round/But I keep flying, I keep fighting/You won’t ever bring me down.' That's like the most positive shit I've ever written.

It is based at RAF Cosford, Shropshire, and flies a fleet of six Grob Tutors.  In 2009 the squadron upgraded the aircraft to the Grob Tutor EA which has an advanced avionics suite. The Squadron has four Flights, A, B, C and D; each with a student Flight Commander who holds the rank of Acting Pilot Officer and a Deputy who holds the rank of Officer Cadet. UBAS is also the parent squadron of 8 Air Experience Flight, who jointly fly UBAS' Tutor fleet.

A Squadron Leader is the Commanding Officer, while UBAS also has several other Qualified Flying Instructors and a Ground Training Instructor. There are some seventy students on the squadron, which accepts members from the University of Birmingham, Birmingham City University, Aston University, Coventry University, Warwick University, Keele University, Wolverhampton University Staffordshire University, Worcester University, and Harper Adams University.

Students volunteer to join UBAS at their university's Freshers' Fair and then undergo a selection process.  If successful they are attested and join the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve.  All Students are given the rank of Officer Cadet, and are issued with a uniform. UBAS activities include flight, sports, military and leadership training, adventurous training, charity and community work and a vibrant social scene.  The scope of UBAS, like other University Air Squadrons is to let young people experience life in the Royal Air Force and to develop their skills in the fields mentioned.

History

Birmingham University Air Squadron was formed on 3 May 1941 and began its first undergraduate initial officer training course in October 1942. In October 1946 it began flying training at RAF Castle Bromwich on the DH Tiger Moth T Mk 2 aircraft. The Squadron re-equipped with the DHC-1 Chipmunk T10 in July 1950 and was renamed the University of Birmingham Air Squadron (UBAS) on 15 October 1951. In March 1958 UBAS was relocated to RAF Shawbury. The Chipmunks served for 25 years until the SA Bulldog T1's replaced them in June 1975. UBAS moved ""temporarily"" to RAF Cosford in March 1978, and it has remained based there ever since. The Bulldogs were retired in 2001 and were replaced with the Austrian-built Grob G-115E Tutor aircraft. In November 2009 the Grob 115E's were partly replaced with the higher specification Grob 115 EA.

Flying

All of the cadets have the opportunity to participate in the flying syllabus for the University Air Squadrons.

Successful completion of the Core Syllabus qualifies the student pilot for the award of the Preliminary Flying Badge, or 'Budgie Wings' as they are sometimes called.

Student Leadership Team 
Squadron activities are largely run by students who take on various executive roles within UBAS. The squadron is split in to 4 flights, each commanded by a Flight Commander who holds the rank of Acting Pilot Officer. The flights also have a deputy flight commander who holds the rank of Officer Cadet.

One of the flight commanders also takes on the role of Senior Student and is in overall command of all students, serving as a link between the student body and the staff. The current senior student is Acting Pilot Officer Marcus Baker.

The introduction of American ""miracle foods"" was instrumental in pulling the Iberian population out of the famine and hunger that was common in the 16th century. Maize (corn), potatoes, turkey, squash, beans, and tomatoes were all incorporated into existing Spanish and Portuguese cuisine styles. Equally important was the impact of coffee and sugar cane growing in the New World (despite having already existed in the Old World). Along with the impact from food, the introduction of new goods (such as tobacco) also altered how Iberian society worked. One can categorize the impacts of these New World goods and foods based on their influence over the state, the economy, religious institutions, and the culture of the time. The power and influence of the state grew as external entities (i.e. other European nations) became dependent on Spain for these New Goods in the early 16th century. The economies of both Portugal and Spain saw an enormous increase in power as a result of trading these American goods.

Luxury goods and foods

Several of the goods and foods brought to the Old World appealed to the lavish tastes of the upper classes. The difficulties involved in gaining this goods led them to go for higher prices and their elite status amongst the rich.

Cocoa

Chocolate was by far one of the most influential of the New World goods on Spanish, and later European, society. By the 1590s, chocolate had a significant presence in the Iberian Peninsula. The growing chocolate habit in Spain led to a cross-cultural transmission of tastes (such as vanilla, pepper, the color red, and a foamy froth similar to that found in chocolate). The taste for chocolate diffused in a bottom-up fashion as colonists and conquistadors encountered new native tastes. Spaniards in the Americas who initially encountered the chocolate liquid had mixed reactions, but a love for the new taste quickly spread into the Iberian Peninsula itself. The method in which chocolate's popularity spread changed by the time it had reached the peninsula. Cacao was necessary for chocolate, but it also served as a currency throughout Mesoamerica, which is evidence of its status as a precious good throughout the region. If a commoner were to drink it, it would be seen almost as bad as saying a bad prayer or omen. Chocolate began to form a relationship with the people it would be found at weddings or betrothals. The upper class in Spain would embrace this chocolate craving to the point where the lower classes sought to emulate them. For natives, chocolate was filled with religious meaning while it played the role of a drug for the Spanish. The distinction between how the two societies perceived the role of chocolate's use is interesting. Natives saw this liquid through the lens of religious meaning while the Spanish saw the economic and culinary benefits. By the 1620s, thousands of pounds of chocolate were imported to Spain annually. The components of European chocolate evolved over time as the Spanish sought to modify the formula to reflect available resources (such as adding sugar as a sweetener rather than honey). Chocolate started a lavish item in the diets of the Spanish nobility but eventually became an accessible commodity for all members of Spanish society. While the initial interest in chocolate for the Spanish was hampered by negative stigmas (i.e. that chocolate drinking was a form of idolatry), chocolate went on to become one of the most desired and influential goods from the New World.

Sugar

While initially a crop of the Indian subcontinent, the cultivation of sugar in the New World had significant effects on Spanish society. New World sugar cultivation added to the growing power of the Spanish and Portuguese economies while also increasing the popularity of slave labor (which had severe impacts on African, American, and European societies). Sugar started off as a mark of social statues amongst the upper classes but gradually trickled down towards the lower classes. This desire for sugar reflected social reasons other than simply a biologically pleasing taste for the tongue. 
Sociologist Pierre Bourdieu argues that subjective pleasures, such as a taste for sugar, reflect social constructs and often are determined by those in power. Bourdeieu's argument certainly suggests that the popularity of sugar in Iberian society was a result of the perceived value placed on it by the upper classes whom held power.

Coffee

While initially an Ethiopian product, the cultivation of coffee in the New World increased its popularity amongst the European population substantially. The cultivation and spread of coffee into Europe was started in the 15th century in the Arab world. The assimilation of chocolate into Spanish tastes paved the way for coffee as the new hot stimulant drink to gain popularity in Spain. Coffee imports even surpassed those of chocolate by the 18th century. The desire for coffee, like that of chocolate, eventually spread to include all castes in Iberia. Coffee, along with chocolate and sugar, stimulated a growing taste for New World sweet goods.

Tobacco

As we know more now than ever, tobacco had very addictive qualities. The insidious addictiveness of tobacco led to an increasingly prominent demand for the good in New World trade. The plant was initially smoked by native tribes in the Americas for ceremonial purposes. It was believed to be a gift from the gods and was used primarily by religious leaders. The Spanish changed this dynamic of the crop when they began trading tobacco as a commodity. The demand for tobacco stimulated the Spanish and Portuguese trade networks as well as increased Iberian power in world trade. The tobacco trade dominated the economies of the south-eastern US up until the peak of cotton's popularity in world trade.

Vanilla

Vanilla, a flavoring derived from the orchids of the genus Vanilla, was first brought to Spain in the 1520s by Cortez following his conquest of the Aztec Empire. The Aztecs had started cultivating the plant following their subjugation of the Totonec peoples of present-day Mexico.

Vanilla quickly became popular as a sweetener in Spain and then the rest of Europe. Along with coffee and chocolate, sugar started a desire for sweet tastes from the New World. The crop eventually spread down to the rest of European society and has become and incredible common good in European society. One could even argue sugar had reached the status of a staple for Iberian and, in a broader sense, European society.

Staples

Several foods that came from the New World rapidly became staples in Europe. Examples of European dependence on Mesoamerican foods can be found in Ireland with the potato and in Italy with the tomato.

Maize

Columbus encountered and noted the cultivation of maize on all of his voyages. The Aztecs and Mayans of Central America had long cultivated several forms of the crop before its introduction into Europe. Traders and merchants brought corn back to Europe in the 16th century where, due to its ability to grow in diverse regions, the crop spread rapidly in popularity. Maize became a pivotal crop in the Turkish Empire and the Balkans by the mid 16th century. Maize became a necessity for the growing Ottoman armies and was noted for its productive harvests. The fact that corn had reached the Ottoman Empire by the mid-16th century certainly suggests it was a prevalent crop in both Spain and Portugal at the time.

Squash

The native populations of the Americas had long relied on squash, along with corn and beans, as prime staples for their peoples. The Spanish who brought this crop back to Europe found similar practical use in the crop and adopted it as a staple. Squash was known in the Turkish Empire by 1539. This could have possibly been the result of goods brought from expelled Spanish Jews and Muslims. If this is true, then it raises an interesting question about how the expulsion of Jews and Muslims from the Iberian Peninsula altered the rest of the Old World. Jews and Muslims leaving the peninsula would bring with them goods, customs, and traditions from Spain to their new homes. This certainly could have been the reason why squash had reached the Ottomans in the early 16th century.

Beans

While beans have long been around in Europe and Asia. Common, lima, and sieva beans are a few of the new types of beans that were introduced to Europe following Columbus's initial voyages. Natives had long recognized the protein-rich benefits of beans. The Spanish were quick to adopt the new beans into their diets.

Tomatoes

Tomatoes had long been popular in South America where the native peoples of Peru grew and traded them. Cortez's conquests in the 16th century resulted in the crops introduction into Spain and then Europe. The crop grew well in Mediterranean soils and quickly grew in popularity. The first discovered cookbook with tomato recipes was published in Naples in 1692.
Culinary historian Alan Davidson argues that the tomato and potato were initially treated with suspicion due to their similarity to the poisonous belladonna plant. This explains why Spanish society was initially slow to incorporate the tomato into their diet (relative to the initial popularity of other foods, such as chocolate and maize).

Turkey

Spaniards had encountered domesticated turkeys in Panama in 1502. These turkeys were part of a pre-existing land trade route throughout Central and South America carried out by various native peoples. The Spanish then brought the turkey back to Spain where it became a popular new type of meat eaten by the masses.

New peppers

Columbus had recorded at least two new types of peppers following his first voyage. Spain, following Columbus's initial encounter, gradually incorporate these new peppers into their diets and spread them throughout Europe. The spread of peppers in the Old World was dependent on pre-existing trade networks through Europe, Africa, Asia, and the Near East. The Portuguese and Ottomans were more influential in the diffusion of the Mesoamerican food complex across Europe than the Spanish (who introduced the crops in the first place). By 1543, the first European illustrations of peppers were published in a German herbal. Peppers from the New World began to replace the pre-existing peppers from Africa and Asia.

Potato

The tuberous crop known as the potato originated in the southern region of Peru. The potato served as the principal staple crop for the Inca Empire and was met with similar popularity in the Spanish Empire. Spanish armies and workers adopted the crop as a staple because of the relative ease associated with its production. Peasants also adopted the crop as the 16th century progressed. The potato continued to spread rapidly throughout Europe where, by the 19th century, it had replaced the turnip and rutabaga as the principal food staples.

Other influential goods

The influence of goods and foods from the Americas spread into other aspects of Iberian life aside from playing lavish and staple roles.

Cotton

Cotton was originally cultivated by the inhabitants of the Indus Valley. While Europe had contact with the crop before the discovery of the New World, its use and popularity increased dramatically following the incorporation of cotton plantations on newly quired American lands. Columbus encountered woven cotton fabrics in Nicaragua and Honduras during his fourth voyages. While cotton's spread into Europe was gradual, it came to revolutionize fabric production in the Old World. This crop, along with many others in the Americas, led to an increasing demand for slave labor. Cotton would reach the peak of its cultivation during the Industrial Revolution in Europe.

Rubber

Rubber was originally cultivated by the Olmec people of Mesoamerica. This was usually done by draining the sap from rubber trees. Rubber did not have an early noticeable impact on the Iberian people. The fact that the Pará rubber tree initially only grew in the Amazon Rainforest. It would not be until the 19th century that the tree was able to be grown in a non-Brazilian area.

Flow of knowledge

While not necessarily a good, the flow of knowledge from the New World that came with the introduction of new foods had an enormous influence on Iberian and European society. The knowledge on how to cultivate new foods was essential in the early spread of Mesoamerican goods into Iberian society. It is reasonable to assume that the influx of knowledge added new professions to Iberian society while changing the way pre-existing professions operated, especially in regards to agriculture.

Non-social consequences

The influx of new goods and foods into 16th-century Spain and Portugal had significant effects on other aspects of Iberian history besides merely the society.

Economic impact

Spain and Portugal, having been the first two European nations to begin trading New World goods, developed impressive economies as a result of their control over the trade of American goods and foods in the early 16th century. Cravings for New World stimulants such as coffee and sugar may have motivated people to work harder to obtain money to supply these new habits. Along with this, the accessory implements that were necessary for many of these new goods (such as tobaccos and coffee) led to a new professions aimed at manufacturing clay pipes, snuffboxes, porcelain chocolate pots etc.

The Spanish and Portuguese capitalized upon every opportunity to extract revenue back to their empires; utilizing forced labor. When the Pope banned the use of forced labor by the natives, Spanish and Portuguese entrepreneurs turned to the African Slavery. The demand for New World goods, such as chocolate, led to an enormous growth in the transatlantic slave trade during the 16th and 17th centuries. The slave trade had devastating effects on the societies of several African nations. The Spanish crown applied the tactic of extraction to keep cost at ultimate low, which led to political corruption in their colonies and back at home. Patch summarizes it as, “an entire commercial system based on government official came into existence.” Spain extractive method of its colonies would soon be problematic and outdated, as new global players would become involved in the Americas. The Spanish colonial system and economic dependency for raw materials would hinder Spain's commercial markets. Spain would place less emphasis on their colonies in North America due to its lack of mineral wealth and would use them to as buffers to protect ports and other colonies further south. Weber highlights the flaw when stating, “The economic malaise that affected Spain’s North American colonies reflected the weakness of the Spanish economy itself, built traditionally on the exportation of raw materials and the importation of manufactured goods.” Spanish economy back at home, spiraling with inflation, would become dependent upon foreign imports and manufactured goods. The significant amount of silver brought back to Spain and Portugal created inflation in Europe. For Spain, the period is referred to as Spanish price revolution. the Spanish inflation had raised domestic manufactures and made them uncompetitive. Spain's colonial agenda of extraction would lead to its inability to supply its colonies and subjects at home. Weber builds upon the Spanish inability to capitalize commercial markets when stating, “The cost of transportation plus profits for numerous middlemen and additional internal custom duties (alcabalas) along the way drove the price of some items to many time their Verecruz or Mexico City value by the time they reached the frontier.” The crown's inability to establish efficient trading route and placement of high tariffs would discourage merchants and traders from legitimate business practices. Spain's colonies in the Americas would soon suffer as merchants and traders would turn to other forms of trade. Weber summarizes it when stating, “For suppliers and consumers alike, such artificially high prices made smuggling so attractive that perhaps two-thirds of all commerce throughout the Spanish empire consisted of illegal trade, much of it with foreigner… it increased as English and French merchants grew more numerous and proximate.”

Religious impact

The abundance of meat in Spanish America led to the use of animal fats over olive oil in cooking. Pope Pius III, in recognition of the meat basis for their diet, granted a thirty-year exemption from fasting for the colonists. This led to a further reliance on meat in the Spanish American diet and persisted to be a common occurrence in the cuisine following the thirty-year mark. Similarly, the Catholic restriction on meat on Fridays led to new innovations in cuisine using newly discovered American foodstuffs.

State impact

Despite the mutual trade exclusion that existed between Spain and Portugal in the early 16th century, Portuguese merchants still acquired goods from the Spanish. This led to a Portuguese dominance on the pepper trade within Europe. The Portuguese trade with the New World flourished despite the Treaty of Tordesillas due to illicit trade and Spanish permission to Portuguese merchants to bring African slaves and other trade goods into the colonies. This obvious disregard towards sanctions on trade didn't signify inherent disloyalty, but was a necessity for those whose livelihoods depended on such trade. The trade underground trade between Spain and Portugal was heightened by the African slave trade and became well established as mutually beneficial crops (such as maize, grains, squash, and beans were traded between the nations). Venice, Genoa, and Florence (among other Old World nations) depended on Iberians for New world goods in the early 16th century.
If not for the incorporation of American ""miracle foods"", Europe may have not pulled out of its 16th-century cycles of hunger and starvation. The dependence on Spain and Portugal for New World goods perpetuated their colonization throughout the world. This, in turn, led to Spain and Portugal becoming the two leading world powers in the 16th and 17th centuries.

The enormous wealth being extracted from the Americas and poured into the Spanish society would lead to corruption at home and in the colonies. Corruption and accumulation of vast resources at the top of the food chain had some ripple effects throughout the core countries. Corruption ran high from the top of the system, beginning from the crown in Spain and spread throughout the colonies. Royals, elites, government officials, and merchants grew significantly wealthy in a short period of time. Patch points out that, “State played a leading role in capital accumulation under colonialism. “Corruption” was therefore an integral and necessary part of the state system.” Government officials played a key role in the system in which they helped mobilize and invest capital, channeled the surplus away from the producers, and then split the profits with their merchant partners.  Merchant status increased as corruption increased, playing a key role in spreading different commodities and ideas. One recorded instances of corruption occurred when the Crown needed revenue such as in times of war. The Sale of Magistracies began in the 1670s, when the government of the last Habsburg king, Charles II, introduced the measure in a desperate attempt to tap all possible sources of revenue. Technically not sold but a post was usually granted to worthy subject who had performed monetary service for the king. Corruption ran high as the sale of a post became more commonly sold then given away.

Cultural impact

By the late 1630s, it was increasingly common to find depictions of chocolate accouterments in still life paintings.

He was a former Satanic priest who returned to the Catholic faith and became a third order Dominican, dedicating his life to the Rosary and the Virgin Mary. He was eventually awarded a papal knighthood of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre.

Early years
Bartolo Longo, was born into a wealthy family on February 10, 1841 in the small town of Latiano, near Brindisi, in southern Italy. His parents were devout Roman Catholics. In 1851, Longo's father died and his mother remarried a lawyer. Despite Longo's stepfather wanting him to become a teacher, Longo was set on becoming a lawyer. In 1861, Longo succeeded in convincing his stepfather and was sent to the University of Naples to study law.

In the 1860s, the Catholic Church in Italy found itself at odds with a strong nationalistic movement. General Giuseppe Garibaldi, who played a key role in Italian unification, saw the Pope as an antagonist to Italian nationalism and actively campaigned for the elimination of the papal office altogether. The Catholic Church in Europe was also competing with a growing popularity in Spiritualism and Occultism. Because of this, many students at the University of Naples took part in demonstrations against the pope, dabbled in witchcraft and consulted Neapolitan mediums. Longo became involved with a movement that he claimed led him into a Satanist cult. After some study and several ""spiritual"" experiences Longo said that he was ordained as a satanic priest.

Conversion

In the following years, Longo's life became one of ""depression, nervousness, and confusion"". Bothered by paranoia and anxiety, he turned to a hometown friend, Vincenzo Pepe, for guidance. It was Pepe who convinced him, in Longo's account, to abandon Satanism and introduced him to the Dominican priest Alberto Radente who led him to a devotion to the Rosary. On October 7, 1871, Longo became a Dominican tertiary and took the name ""Rosario"". Around this time, he reportedly visited a séance and held up a rosary, declaring, ""I renounce spiritualism because it is nothing but a maze of error and falsehood."" He also came to know some Franciscans with whom he helped the poor and incurably ill for two years. Bartolo also kept up his law practice, which took him to the nearby village of Pompei. He went to Pompei to take care of the affairs of Countess Marianna Farnararo De Fusco.

In Pompei, Longo later recounted, he was shocked at the erosion of the people's faith. He wrote, ""Their religion was a mixture of superstition and popular tradition. ... For their every need, ... they would go to a witch, a sorceress, in order to obtain charms and witchcraft."" Through talking to the citizens, Bartolo came to recognize their severe lack of catechesis. When he asked one man if there was only one God, the fellow answered, ""When I was a child, I remember people telling me there were three. Now, after so many years, I don't know if one of them is dead or one has married.""

Longo wrote of his personal struggles with mental illness, paranoia, depression and anxiety. At one point, he noted struggling with suicidal thoughts, but rejected them by recalling the promise of Dominic, ""he who propagates my Rosary will be saved."" Longo wrote that this promise is what convinced him to encourage public devotion to the rosary.

Shrine of Our Lady of Pompei

With the help of Countess Mariana di Fusco, he inaugurated a confraternity of the Rosary and in October 1873 started restoring a dilapidated church. He sponsored a festival in honor of Our Lady of the Rosary.

In 1875, Longo obtained as a gift a painting portraying Our Lady of the Rosary, with Saint Dominic and Saint Catherine of Siena. M. Concetta de Litala, a religious sister of the Monastery of the Rosary at Porta Medina, had been holding it for the Dominican priest Alberto Radente. Radente had acquired it from a junk-shop dealer in Naples for a very small sum. The painting was in bad condition and Longo wrote of his immediate distaste of the poor artistic quality when he first saw it. However, he accepted the gift to conserve funds and to not insult Concetta. Longo raised funds to restore the image and placed it in the church in an effort to encourage pilgrimages.

Alleged miracles began to be reported and people began flocking in droves to the church. Longo was encouraged by the Bishop of Nola to begin the construction of a larger church—the cornerstone being laid on May 8, 1876. The church was consecrated in May 1891 by Cardinal La Valletta (representing Pope Leo XIII). In 1939, the church was enlarged to a basilica, known today as the Basilica of Our Lady of the Most Holy Rosary of Pompei.

Later life and death

At the suggestion of Pope Leo XIII, Bartolo Longo and the Countess Mariana di Fusco were married on April 7, 1885. The couple remained continent (abstained from intercourse), and continued to do many charitable works and provided for orphaned children and the children of prisoners, which was radical for its time. In 1906 they donated the entire property of the Pompei shrine to the Holy See. Longo continued promoting the Rosary until his death on October 5, 1926, at the age of 85. The piazza on which his basilica stands has since been named in memory of Longo. His body is encased in a glass tomb and he is wearing the mantle of a Knight of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre, a papal order of knighthood.

Beatification
On October 26, 1980, he was beatified by Pope John Paul II, who would call him the ""Apostle of the Rosary"" and mentioned him specifically in his apostolic letter ""Rosarium Virginis Mariae"" (The Rosary of the Virgin Mary).

On October 7, 2003, Pope John Paul II prayed for world peace at the basilica. More than 30,000 people were waiting to greet him as he flew in by helicopter.

In that situation, the firm will experience a higher loss when it produces, compared to not producing at all. 

Technically, shutdown occurs if average revenue is below average variable cost at the profit-maximizing positive level of output. Producing anything would not generate enough revenue to offset the associated variable costs; producing some output would add further costs in excess of revenues to the costs inevitably being incurred (the fixed costs). By not producing, the firm loses only the fixed costs.

Explanation

The goal of a firm is to maximize profits or minimize losses. The firm can achieve this goal by following two rules. First, the firm should operate, if at all, at the level of output where marginal revenue equals marginal cost. Second, the firm should shut down rather than operate if it can reduce losses by doing so.

The shutdown rule

Generally, a firm must have revenue , total costs, in order to avoid losses. However, in the short run, all fixed costs are sunk costs. Netting out fixed costs, a firm then faces the requirement that  (total revenue equals or exceeds variable costs), in order to continue operating. Thus, a firm will find it profitable in the short run to operate so long as the market price equals or exceeds average variable cost (p ≥ AVC). Conventionally stated, the shutdown rule is: ""in the short run a firm should continue to operate if price equals or exceeds average variable costs."" Restated, the rule is that to produce in the short run a firm must earn sufficient revenue to cover its variable costs. The rationale for the rule is straightforward. By shutting down, a firm avoids all variable costs. However, the firm must still pay fixed costs. Because fixed costs must be paid regardless of whether a firm operates they should not be considered in deciding whether to produce or shut down.

Thus in determining whether to shut down a firm should compare total revenue to total variable costs (VC) rather than total costs (FC (fixed costs) + VC). If the revenue the firm is receiving is greater than its variable cost (R > VC) then the firm is covering all variable cost plus there is additional revenue which partially or entirely offsets fixed costs. (The size of the fixed costs is irrelevant as it is a sunk cost. The same consideration is used whether fixed costs are one dollar or one million dollars.) On the other hand if VC > R then the firm is not even covering its short-run production costs and it should immediately shut down. The rule is conventionally stated in terms of price (average revenue) and average variable costs. The rules are equivalent—if one divides both sides of inequality TR > VC (total revenue exceeds variable costs) by the output quantity Q one obtains P > AVC (price exceeds average variable cost). If the firm decides to operate it will produce where marginal revenue equals marginal costs because these conditions insure profit maximization (or equivalently, when profit is negative, loss minimization).

Another way to state the rule is that a firm should compare the profits from operating to those realized if it shut down, and select the option that produces the greater profit (positive or negative). A firm that is shut down is generating zero revenue and incurring no variable costs. However the firm still incurs fixed cost. So the firm’s profit equals the negative of fixed costs or (–FC). An operating firm is generating revenue, incurring variable costs and paying fixed costs. The operating firm's profit is R – VC – FC . The firm should continue to operate if R – VC – FC ≥ –FC which simplified is R ≥ VC. The difference between revenue, R, and variable costs, VC, is the contribution toward offsetting fixed costs, and any positive contribution is better than none. Thus, if R ≥ VC then the firm should operate. If R < VC the firm should shut down.

Monopolist shutdown rule

A monopolist should shut down when price (average revenue) is less than average variable cost for every output level; in other words, it should shut down if the demand curve is entirely below the average variable cost curve. Under these circumstances, even at the profit-maximizing level of output (where MR = MC, marginal revenue equals marginal cost) average revenue would be lower than average variable costs and the monopolist would be better off shutting down in the short run.

Sunk costs

An implicit assumption of the above rules is that all fixed costs are sunk costs. However, there can be physical assets whose cost during production is fixed but which have a salvage value which can be obtained if there is a shutdown. When some costs are sunk and some are not sunk, total fixed costs (TFC) equal sunk fixed costs (SFC) plus non-sunk fixed costs (NSFC) or TFC = SFC + NSFC. When some fixed costs are non-sunk, the shutdown rule must be modified. To illustrate the new rule it is necessary to define a new cost curve, the average non-sunk cost curve, or ANSC. The ANSC equals the average variable costs plus the average non-sunk fixed cost or ANSC = AVC + ANFC.  The new rule then becomes: if the price is greater than the minimum average cost, produce; if the price is between minimum average cost and minimum ANSC, produce; and if the price is less than minimum ANSC for all levels of production, shut down. If all fixed costs are non-sunk, then (a competitive) firm would shut down if the price were below average total costs.

Short-run shutdown compared to long-run exit

A decision to shut down means that the firm is temporarily suspending production. It does not mean that the firm is going out of business (exiting the industry). If market conditions improve, due to prices increasing or production costs falling, the firm can resume production. Shutting down is a short-run decision. A firm that has shut down is not producing, but it still retains its capital assets; however, the firm cannot leave the industry or avoid its fixed costs in the short run. 

However, a firm will not choose to incur losses indefinitely. In the long run, the firm will have to decide whether to continue in business or to leave the industry and pursue profits elsewhere. Exit is a long-term decision. A firm that has exited an industry has avoided all commitments and freed all capital for use in more profitable enterprises. A firm that exits an industry earns no revenue but it incurs no costs, fixed or variable. 

The long-run decision is based on the relationship of the price P and long-run average costs LRAC. If P ≥ LRAC then the firm will not exit the industry. If P < LRAC, then the firm will exit the industry. These comparisons will be made after the firm has made the necessary and feasible long-term adjustments. 

In the long run a firm operates where marginal revenue equals long-run marginal costs, but only if it decides to remain in the industry. Thus a perfectly competitive firm's long-run supply curve is the long-run marginal cost curve above the minimum point of the long-run average cost curve.

Calculating the shutdown point

The short run shutdown point for a competitive firm is the output level at the minimum of the average variable cost curve. Assume that a firm's total cost function is TC = Q3 -5Q2 +60Q +125. Then its variable cost function is
Q3 –5Q2 +60Q, and its 
average variable cost function is (Q3 –5Q2 +60Q)/Q= Q2 –5Q + 60. The slope of the average variable cost curve is the derivative of the latter, namely 2Q – 5. Equating this to zero to find the minimum gives Q = 2.5, at which level of output average variable cost is 53.75. Thus if the market price of the product drops below 53.75, the firm will choose to shut down production.

The long run shutdown point for a competitive firm is the output level at the minimum of the average total cost curve. Assume that a firm's total cost function is the same as in the above example. To find the shutdown point in the long run, first take the derivative of ATC and then set it to zero and solve for Q. After getting Q plug it into the MC to get the price.

The conflict occurred as a result of UNITA breaking the Bicesse Accords, on account of alleged voter fraud in the 1992 Angolan general elections, resulting in a number of armed MPLA supporters and police around Luanda harassing and murdering a significant number of opposition party supporters. Thousands of UNITA supporters are estimated to have been murdered.

Context

The Angolan Civil War 

Since independence from Portugal in 1975, Angola had been in a civil war between the MPLA and UNITA. The Marxist-Leninist MPLA received direct support from Cuba with the backing of the Soviet Union and other communist states, whilst the UNITA sold itself as an anti-communist organization and received direct military support from South Africa with help from the United States. Ferocious combat was waged during this time period but neither side was able to claim total victory over the other. As the Cold War began to draw to a close, Cuba and South Africa withdrew their troops from the conflict, forcing the MPLA and UNITA into negotiating a political settlement to the conflict.

The Bicesse Accords 

From 1 May 1991, UNITA and MPLA forces agreed on a framework to begin establishing peace in Angola between the two parties. This framework evolved into the Bicesse Accords, signed by the People's Republic of Angola and UNITA on 31 May 1991 in Lisbon, Portugual. The United States and the USSR acted as observers, while Portugual mediated the talks. The accords set out a timetable and established certain conditions that each side agreed to meet by the specified dates. There were three key parts of the agreement; the beginning of a ceasefire (with the initial stages taking effect at the beginning of May and entering into force upon the signing of the accords), the integration of UNITA forces into the Angolan armed forces (which was to occur upon the implementation of the cease fire agreement and had numerous provisions to establish the non-partisan nature of the armed forces), and a nationwide democratic election, which was to take place between the 1st of September to the 30th of November 1992.

1992 Angolan general election 

The 1992 elections took place from 29 September 1992 to 30 September 1992. The MPLA claimed victory in these elections, taking roughly fifty-three percent of the vote and gaining one hundred and twenty nine seats in the legislature whereas UNITA claimed thirty four percent of the vote and gained seventy seats. For the presidency, José Eduardo dos Santos of the MPLA received forty-nine percent of the vote compared to UNITA Savimbi's forty percent. Despite having a higher percentage of the vote, dos Santos was just under the fifty percent majority required to be reelected. Because neither the MPLA nor UNITA obtained the required absolute majority of the presidential election, a follow-up election was necessary according to the constitution. Savimbi, in spite of the UN mission's declaration that the elections were generally free and fair, claimed that the government had rigged the elections, and began pulling UNITA's soldiers out of the new unified Angolan armed forces.

Massacre
The MPLA attacked UNITA positions in Luanda on October 30th. According to some reports, the violence had been planned over the course of weeks. Reports from residents of Luanda's suburbs claimed that ""...arms were being distributed locally to government supporters and to former members of the security forces and militia"", as well as  reports that ""police stations served as centres of distribution"". UNITA supporters were targeted in house to house searches by both police and armed government supporters, with some supporters possessing lists of local UNITA supporters who were to be rounded up. Some were summarily executed while others were taken to police stations and later released, though often after being beaten. Some people disappeared completely, with some human rights reports detailing accounts of security forces carrying out executions of suspected UNITA supporters.

Many of the targeted were of the Ovimbundu and Bakongo ethnic groups, which were the main supporters of the UNITA and considered to be potentially disloyal. Other opposition parties that supported UNITA's claim that the 1992 election results were illegitimate were also targeted. This included the Partido Social Democrata Angolano (PSDA), Angolan Social Democratic Party, Partido Democrático para o Progresso-Aliança Nacional Angolana (PDP-ANA), Democratic Progress Party/Angolan National Alliance and the Convenção Nacional Democrática de Angola (CNDA), Angolan National Democratic Convention.

Results

Several leading officials from UNITA were killed in the massacre, including the UNITA Vice President Jeremias Chitunda, negotiator Elias Salupeto Pena and party secretary Aliceres Mango. The total number of casualties ranges, with some sources saying the deaths numbered as high as 30,000.

In July 2014, it was revealed by Glenn Greenwald through the Edward Snowden leaks that Gill was one of five prominent Muslim United States citizens that were under NSA surveillance.

Biography
In 2007, Gill ran for a seat in the Virginia House of Delegates as a Republican losing to Democratic opponent Paul F. Nichols. In 2012, Gill relocated to Winooski, Vermont. In 2016, he was a candidate in the Democratic Primary for one of six seats in the multi-member Chittenden Senate District of Vermont. On March 4, 2017, Gill was elected as interim chairman of the Vermont Democratic Party, becoming the first-ever Muslim to lead a state party. He was not a candidate for a full term in November. In 2018, Gill moved to Porter Ranch, California, near Los Angeles.

Homeland Security career and targeting
In 2003, Gill served as a spokesman for the American Muslim Council, an organization founded by Abdurahman Alamoudi to encourage Muslim political participation. al-Alamoudi was sentenced to 23 years in federal prison for bringing over one million dollars in cash provided by the Libyan government into the U.S.

After being appointed by George W. Bush as a policy director for the Department of Homeland Security, Gill was investigated by officials in connection to al-Amoudi but was ultimately cleared by a polygraph test and allowed to resume work. However, pundit Frank Gaffney led a public campaign to discredit Gill, highlighting the brief inquiry into Gill's AMC connections and soliciting letters from Congressional Republicans calling for an investigation. In a 2004 statement defending Gill, a DHS spokesman said: ""DHS is confident that our security clearance process is effective. Mr. Gill was thoroughly vetted at several levels. Mr. Gill did not withhold information on government forms required to initiate government security clearance processing and has been cooperative throughout the process."" Faisal Gill left the Department of Homeland Security in January, 2005.

In 2014, NSA documents leaked by Edward Snowden revealed that the NSA had been spying on Gill and several other prominent Muslim-Americans beginning in 2006.

Asked whether he believes he would have been monitored by the NSA if he were not Muslim, Gill is blunt. ""Absolutely not,"" he says. ""Look, I've never made an appearance or been a lawyer for anyone who's been [associated with terrorism]. But there are plenty of other lawyers who have made those appearances and actually represented those governments, and their name isn't Faisal Gill and they weren’t born in Pakistan and they aren't on this list.""

Anti-LGBT marriage activism 
In October 2006, Gill appeared on behalf of The Virginians for marriage and the Family Foundation in a public forum in support of the Virginia Marriage Amendment which barred recognition of gay marriage in the state of Virginia.  At the forum, Gill stated, ""I believe that marriage should be between a man and a woman"". Gill also said that without the amendment marriage would be rendered meaningless. The amendment passed with 57% of the vote but was later ruled to be unconstitutional.

Gill has since reversed his position and now supports marriage equality.

Campaign for L.A. City Attorney 
In March 2021, Faisal Gill announced his campaign for Los Angeles City Attorney in 2022. He won the primary alongside Hydee Feldstein Soto and will go into a runoff election in November 2022.

It protects an area of  of marine wildlife. The administrative center of the sanctuary is on an offshore granite outcrop  by , located on the continental shelf off of California. The outcrop is, at its closest (Point Reyes),  from the sanctuary itself.

Cordell Bank is one of the United States' 13 National Marine Sanctuaries that protect and preserve ocean ecosystems in the U.S. Cordell Bank is a seamount approximately  northwest of San Francisco where the ocean bottom rises to within  of the surface. The seamount was discovered in 1853 by the U.S. Coast Survey, and named for Edward Cordell, who surveyed the area more thoroughly in 1869. It was extensively explored and described during 1978–86 by Robert Schmieder, who published a monograph about it [Schmieder, 1991]. It has been protected as a sanctuary since 1989. The protected area encompasses 526 square miles (1347 km2) of ocean.

The unique blend of ocean conditions and undersea topography creates a rich and diverse underwater ecosystem. A subsurface island rises from soft sediments covering the continental shelf. The upper pinnacles reach to within  of the surface, and the average depth is . The sanctuary serves as a breeding ground for migratory marine mammals, birds, and fish. The prevailing California Current flows southward along the coast, causing an upwelling of nutrient-rich water that provided the foundation for the area's marine ecosystem.

Sanctuary regulations prohibit extraction of hydrocarbons (oil, natural gas), the removal of benthic (bottom-dwelling) organisms, discharge of wastes, and removal of cultural resources. Recreational SCUBA diving is not recommended in the sanctuary due to depth and currents.

Geological setting

Cordell Bank was originally created 93 million years ago, as a member of the Sierra Nevada. The grinding of the plates at the San Andreas Fault, with the Pacific Plate moving north and the North American Plate moving south, parts of the Sierra Mountains were sheared off and carried northwards, including Cordell Bank. Eventually this grinding carried Cordell Bank to its present location opposite Reyes Point. Cordell Bank is still moving, by an average of  per year.

Between 20,000 and 15,000 years ago the sea level in the area was  below the current level, leaving most of Cordell Bank exposed and making it a true island. Today the bank rises out of soft sediment, deposited on the bank more recently by coastal erosion. Within just  of Cordell Bank, the continental shelf drops to over   deep. The seamount is largely composed of granite.

History
Coastal California has a rich history of marine utilization by Native Americans and early settlers. Cordell Bank was a mystery prior to the 19th century because neither the Miwok natives nor the settlers had any incentive to venture far out from shore, when food resources were available close to shore. Many European mariners sailed right over Cordell Bank without even knowing it was there.

In the later half of the 1800s there was a strong incentive to survey the coast of California so as to promote maritime safety. Cordell Bank was discovered in 1853 by George Davidson of the US Coast Survey during a mapping expedition on California's north coast.

In 1869 Edward Cordell (the reserve's namesake) was sent to collect additional information on a ""shoal west of Point Reyes"". He found the area by following the numerous birds and marine mammals. To measure the depth, Cordell lowered a lead weight into the water until it hit the bottom and then measured the length of the line on its return to the surface. The area was considered a productive fishing area, but not much was discovered about its marine life until an expedition in 1977.

NOAA carried out a detailed multibeam echosounder survey of the area in 1985 from aboard the R/V Davidson.

The expedition was led by a non-profit research group, Cordell Expeditions. Over the next 10 years, scores of underwater dives documented the organisms living in, on, and around the bank. The efforts gave rise to an understanding of the biodiversity of the bank, and were instrumental in the decision to make it a sanctuary.

Expansion
A bill (H.R. 5352) was proposed to Congress by Representative Lynn Woolsey to expand the size of the Cordell Bank National Marine Sanctuary and the neighboring Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary by .

In 2012, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration proposed an expansion of the borders of the sanctuary, along with expansion of the Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary, to include an additional 2,700 square miles, reaching to Point Arena.

Expansion was passed March 2015.

Biology
26 species of marine mammals, including whales, dolphins, seals, and sea lions, are known to frequent the waters of the sanctuary. In addition, Cordell Bank is one of the most important feeding grounds in the world for the endangered blue and humpback whales; these species travel all the way from their breeding grounds in coastal Mexico and Central America to feed on the krill that aggregate near the bank. Another unique species is the Pacific white-sided dolphin (Sagmatias obliquidens), which can be seen in large numbers. Other visitors include California sea lions (Zalophus californianus), northern elephant seals  (Mirounga angustirostris), northern fur seals (Callorhinus ursinus), and Steller sea lions (Eumetopias jubatus), all of which are attracted to the abundance in krill, squid, and juvenile fish. Leatherback sea turtles also inhabit sanctuary waters.

Cordell Bank is also a major foraging ground for passing seabirds. Known as the ""Albatross capital of the world,"" 5 of the 14 major species of albatross have been documented there. The two most common are the black-footed albatross (Phoebastria nigripes) and sooty shearwater (Puffinus griseus). It is also one of the few places to see a short-tailed albatross (Phoebastria albatrus), which is extremely rare; the species was thought to have gone extinct after World War II. Currently the world population hovers at around 1000 individuals.

Cordell Bank is also known for its abundance of fish. Flatfish, most notably sanddabs, make their home on the mud of the seafloor in the sanctuary. Both solitary and schooling fish find refuge for predators among the bank's rocky pinnacles. Cordell Bank supports more than 246 species of fish, including 44 species of rockfish, ranging in size from the 8-inch pygmy rockfish to the  yelloweye rockfish.

Although far from shore, sport fishers prize Cordell Bank as a fishing spot, and regularly venture out from shore to catch albacore and salmon.

Ecologic cycle

This unusual granite mountain is surrounded on three sides by deep waters, which allows the flow of deep nutrient-rich waters over relatively shallow waters with sufficient light to support photosynthesis.

The ecological cycle at Cordell Bank can be divided into three oceanographic seasons. During the spring, strong northwestern winds push the water southward along the California coast. Gale winds and the Earth's rotation drive surface water away from the shore, only to be replaced by an upwelling of more nutrient-rich waters from offshore. this contributes to the growth in numbers of phytoplankton, which are the foundation of the marine food web, in turn leading to a rise in the food supply, and thus numbers, of the organisms higher up the chain.

During the late summer and fall seasons, the coastal winds that stirred up the deeper waters die down, and the northward-flowing Davidson Current prevails, bringing warm but nutrient-poor water from the south.

During the winter storm months, the sea is dominated by rough weather, which mixes the deeper water with that above. The temperature on top of the continental shelf mixes, and the temperature, salinity, and the concentration of nutrients in them are assimilated.

In the 1990s it was briefly renamed Reunion Halt.

History
Trains ran past this location for some 21 years before the private Golden Sands Halt opened in the summer of 1948. The post-war boom in south coast holiday camp tourism had brought huge demand to the area, and the Golden Sands holiday camp (located down Dunstall Lane and backing onto the railway line) saw the potential for entertaining its guests by the simple provision of a station on the existing railway line. The camp, originally owned and built by Robert Briggs, was sold to Maddiesons in the late 1950s.

The nature of British holiday making changed greatly over the ensuing decades, but Golden Sands Holiday Camp continued to evolve, and its private railway station remained a feature, as a request stop for service trains on the mainline.

By the early 1980s use of the station had been considerably reduced, and it was largely only special train services (provided for campers) which made use of the station. Golden Sands Halt appeared to have reached the end of its life, and indeed the 'camp' side of the station became (in the late 1980s) a storage area for the private collection of vintage fire engines owned by a director of the holiday camp; however, the 1990s saw the holiday camp enter into new ownership, with a revival of use of the private station. The new owners renamed the camp, and the station followed suit, becoming Reunion Halt.

Closure
The somewhat patchy life of this station is explained by the fact that it is in private ownership, with its fortunes always being totally bound up with those of the holiday camp, together with the fact that St Mary's Bay Station is located just a quarter of a mile further south, and is a fully open public station for all. With a sharp decline in the local holiday-making industry, the station closed in 1995.

Present situation
Today the Reunion campsite has been closed and the site is undergoing re-development as a housing estate. By the mid-2000s all of the buildings at the campsite had been demolished including the original 1948 station. Its single short platform (on the down line) was the sole survivor, and could still just be made out from passing trains, with a concrete surrounding wall, and a wooden gate providing access to and from the derelict campsite, as a reminder of a former era of holiday making. In early 2016 the platform and retaining wall were broken up by developers, removing the final traces of the station, in preparation for the start of construction of houses on the site.

According to the cognitive-affective model, behavior is best predicted from a comprehensive understanding of the person, the situation, and the interaction between person and situation.

Description

Cognitive-affective theorists argue that behavior is not the result of some global personality trait; instead, it arises from individuals' perceptions of themselves in a particular situation.
However, inconsistencies in behavior are not due solely to the situation; inconsistent behaviors reflect stable patterns of variation within the person. These stable variations in behavior present themselves in the following framework: If A, then X; but if B, then Y. People's pattern of variability is the behavioral signature of their personality, or their stable pattern of behaving differently in various situations.
According to this model, personality depends on situation variables, and consists of cognitive-affective units (all those psychological, social, and physiological aspects of people that allow them to interact with their environment in a relatively stable manner).

The authors identified five cognitive-affective units:
encoding strategies, or people's individualized manner of categorizing information from external stimuli;
competencies and self-regulatory strategies: intelligence, self-regulatory strategies, self-formulated goals, and self-produced consequences;
expectancies and beliefs, or people's predictions about the consequences of each of the different behavioral possibilities;
goals and values, which provide behavior consistency;
affective responses, including emotions, feelings, and the affects accompanying physiological reactions.

Evaluation
The cognitive-affective processing system theory attempts to explain seemingly conflicting evidence -- personality remains relatively invariant over time and throughout different social contexts, whereas social behaviors vary substantially across different situations. The theory integrates concepts of personality structure and dynamics, obviating the need for two subdisciplines in personality psychology, each with different and sometimes conflicting goals (i.e. personality dispositions or personality processes).

The group  consists of two fossiliferous limestone formations deposited during the Turonian.

Etymology 
The name Angoumian, in French Angoumien, is derived from the Angoumois region around the town of Angoulême in the Charente.

Occurrence 
The formation crops out in the surroundings of Angoulême, but also reaches farther south into the Dordogne (Périgord, i.e. Périgord Vert & Périgord Blanc).

Stratigraphy 

The Angoumian is usually divided into two formations, a lower Angoumien inférieur and an upper Angoumien supérieur. Some authors even attribute the Ligerian (in French Ligérien) to the Angoumian and then call it basal Angoumian. The Angoumian sensu stricto conformably overlies the Ligerian and closes with a hardground towards the overlying Coniacian.

Lower Angoumian 
(Represented on French geological maps as unit c3b)

The 15–20 m thick lower Angoumian, also called Angoulême Formation, starts with a 5–6 m thick, thinly bedded, microcrystalline limestone of white to creamy colour. This limestone is characterised by the incorporation of fine debris and by a benthic microfauna consisting of foraminifera such as miliolida and textulariida. The first rudists (Sphaerulites patera and Biradiolites lumbricalis) start to appear in this level. Some rare cephalopods have also been found (such as Romaniceras deverianum or Lecointriceras fleuriausianum for instance).

These fairly thin beds then give way to a massive, homogeneous, normally 8–10 m thick, chalky, rudist-bearing limestone of pure white colour. The massive bed stands out geomorphologically, sometimes forming small cliffs in the countryside. Generally this rock is quite soft (it can be cut with a handsaw), it was therefore quarried extensively for building stone with hundreds of small quarries in operation; most of them have closed down by now. The massive member is affected by important thickness variations (its total thickness normally can vary from 5–12 m, sometimes even reaching 15 m), caused either by tectonic disturbances or by post-depositional erosion (for instance, in the Mareuil Anticline, the upper Angoumian discordantly overlies the lower Angoumian, occasionally even cutting down into it). The chalky limestones are mainly composed of rudist debris with comparatively little cement. The rudist debris consists almost exclusively of the species Biradiolites lumbricalis accompanied by minor Durania cornupastoris, Praeradiolites peroni, Radiolites peroni, Radiolites ponsi, Radiolites beaumonti, Radiolites socialis, and Hippurites requieni. In some places, undamaged rudists (mainly the small-sized Biradiolites) can be encountered in numerous biostromes. Towards the top, the massive bed changes its character and thinner beds of a very hard limestone or of an ocre calcarenite appear. This horizon is the upper limit of the quarrying activity and was called chaudron (kettle) by the miners. In addition to the usual fauna, it also comprises small biostromes of Biradiolites angulosus.

The common facies can change quite suddenly (within less than 500 m) into a coarse, weakly cemented, bioclastic facies  (Pierre de Cheyroux) consisting of white to yellowish calcarenites — a beachrock facies, indicating a littoral position of the deposits. The bioclasts are very rounded and are composed of the debris of echinoderms, rudists, single corals (polyps), and milioles. These rather massive calcarenites can reach a thickness of 12–15 m in places and sometimes are affected by cross-bedding. They occur somewhat southeast of the La Tour Blanche anticline and the Périgueux anticline, proving that these major structures were already beginning to rise during the Turonian.

The lower formation finishes with a few metres of thinly bedded, yellowish, microcrystalline limestone rich in bioclasts (lamellibranchs and echinoderms). This member shows cross-bedding and is affected by hiati as observed in Brantôme.

The common rudist-bearing reefal facies can completely change in the western depositional area, taking on a very hard, finely recrystallised aspect without any fossil debris. This facies change is probably due to faulting.

Upper Angoumian 
(represented as unit c3c)

The upper Angoumian, also called Bourg-des-Maisons Formation, can be fairly easily recognised in the countryside by its rather arid aspect with a typical flora of junipers and dwarf bushes growing on it. The total thickness of the upper Angoumian varies from 20 to 40 m. The type locality is at Bourg-des-Maisons.

Its lowermost member of up to 20 m thickness is composed of grey to cream-coloured, rudist bearing, cryptocrystalline limestones. Texturally they are wackestones grading into mudstones. They weather in a nodular and prismatic fashion and are interlayered with microcrystalline limestones rich in fine debris and bioclasts.

The fossil content is dominated by rudist biostromes. The rudists are represented by Durania cornupastoris, Praeradiolites ponsi, Radiolites praesauvagesi, Radiolites radiosus, Radiolites trigeri, Biradiolites quadratus, Biradiolites angulosus, Vaccinites praepetrocoriensis, Vaccinites petrocoriensis, and Hippurites requieni var. subpolygonia. The benthic fossils present indicate a calm and not very deep depositional environment; they comprise lamellibranchs, acteonellidae, nerineoidea, chaetetids, miliolids, and others. In some places, the top part undergoes a facies change to more agitated conditions, especially towards the West and near Périgueux (deposition of cream-coloured, coarse, bioclastic limestones, which are much less recrystallised; their grain size is over 2 mm and they can show large cross-beds).

The second member demonstrates pronounced thickness variations (from 8 to 12 m). In contrast to the first member it is composed either of micrites that are slightly debris-bearing, or of microcrystalline limestones rich in debris. Both rock types enclose the same fauna as the first member. The second member likewise can change its facies to calcarenites of the beachrock type. (These calcarenites persisted near Paussac and near Toulon (Périgueux) right from the lower Angoumian onwards).

The upper Angoumian closes with about 5 m (to as much as 15 m in places) of grey to yellow, platy, marly limestones interlayered with yellow marls. Enclosed fossils are again rudists (Praeradiolites praesinuatus, Praeradiolites praecoquandi, Vaccinites petrocoriensis, and Hippurites requieni), and chaetetids (sponges). The benthic microfauna is quite prominent and contains the foramnifera groups rotaliida, discorbidae, and textulariida with the species Valvulammina picardi or Arenobulimina sp. as well as the ostracode species Bairdia, Cythereis, and Pterygocythereis.

Depositional environment 
After the generally transgressive Ligerian (in comparison with its underlying Cenomanian) dominated by open marine deposits, the Angoumian clearly shows a regressive trend. This fact combined with the generally warm climate during the Turonian allowed the temperature of the sea-water to reach unprecedented values on the inner shelf of the northern Aquitaine Basin (peaking at roughly 10 °C above today's ocean temperatures during the lower Angoumian)  – together with the reigning calm conditions an ideal environment for the widespread expansion of rudist reefs.

During the lower Angoumian (Angoulême Formation), a muddy, calcareous lagoon had established itself on the inner shelf with a low to moderate energy level. The lagoon was fringed or interspersed with extensive rudist reefs shedding their debris mainly towards the open sea. A major reef extended from Périgueux northwestwards thus isolating an inner platform northeast and east of Périgueux from an outer shelf towards the centre of the Aquitaine Basin. On the high(er) energy side of the individual reefs, the more clastic dominated members formed, whereas in the calm inner lagoon, the cryptocrystalline and micritic members were deposited.

By the end of the upper Angoumian (Bourg-des-Maisons Formation), the regression became noticeable as the northern part of the Aquitaine shelf started to fall dry due to uplift in the Massif central. This is recorded in the sediments, which at first took on a clastic character and later underwent profound alterations, breccifications and hardground formation.

The total thickness of the Angoumian varies between 35 and 60 m with a higher accumulation rate occurring on the southwestern side of the depositional area (towards the centre of the Aquitaine Basin).

Structural observations 
The Angoumian forms part of two very open synclines striking NW-SE (the Combiers-Saint-Crépin-de-Richemont syncline in the NE) and WNW-ESE (the Gout-Rossignol-Léguillac synline in the SW) respectively. The group is therefore mainly flat-lying, yet in some places (like near Champeaux it dips 5° to the SW. Only near Beaussac a greater dip (of about 30°) can be found caused by local faulting. Nearby in the Aucors quarry, a  slump overlies the rudist reef, followed by a grain flow. These synsedimentary structures point to a tectonically disturbed setting possibly related to the rising Mareuil Anticline. Small strike-slip faults can be observed near Brantôme which mostly show a horizontal movement direction pointing to the SSE, rarely to the SE. There is also a fairly common occurrence of slickolites (a special kind of stylolite), which indicate the direction of pressure solution in the rock. This direction is mostly vertical, i.e. merely representing the overburden of the overlying strata. Yet significant aberrations from this direction can be observed as well, proving that the group was also under the influence of directional stresses.

Age 
The lower Angoumian is coeval with the upper two-thirds of the middle Turonian, the upper Angoumian is equivalent to the upper Turonian. The Angoumian therefore represents approximately the time interval 91 to 89 million years BP.

His only known work is a painting of the Virgin and Child in the gesture of the Hodogiatria.  The icon resembles similar icons with the inscription Eleousa.  He was clearly influenced by Byzantine painting and is a member of the early Cretan School or Greek Renaissance.  Other Greek artists who painted similar works during the same period were Angelos Akotantos and Andreas Ritzos.  The painting style serves as a prototype for the evolution of the Venetian influenced Cretan School.  Other Italian artists such as Duccio and Giotto experimented with the transition from the typical Byzantine style to a more refined technique.

History
Lampoudis was born in Sparta.  Not much is known about his life.  The only existing record is an icon painted during the 15th century.  His signature describes his place of origin.  Sparta was part of the Despotate of the Morea and fell to the Ottomans in 1460.  The last name was associated with the Greek-Byzantine family named Lampoudios.

The name appears throughout Byzantine history from the 11th century until the 15th century.  There was a famous scribe by the name Matthew Sebastos Lampoudes from the Péloponnèse region, possibly Spartan.  The earliest known record of the Lampoudes name in Crete was 1562–1563.  Records exist regarding Kyriakos Lampoudes.

Lampoudis's technique is the Greek-Byzantine technique prevalent in Thessaloniki, Constantinople, and Crete.  Angelos Akotantos's and Andreas Ritzos's paintings served as the prototype of the maniera greca and the Greek Renaissance or Cretan School.
Lampoudis appears at the end of the Byzantine art movement and the beginning of the Greek Renaissance.

The Lampoudis painting has been preserved for over six hundred years.  The icon is in a private collection in Athens, it previously belonged to a collector in Rome.  The icon's dimensions are 0.67 X 0.47 X 0.02 meter or 2.2 X 1.54 X 0.07 feet and is painted on wood that forms a relief frame.           
  
The painting was bought at an auction in London.  It belonged to an Italian family for three generations.  In 1981, it was preserved by Rodolfo Lujan.  He fixed the wood and painting.  He also cleaned it in a special laboratory.  In 1984, the Byzantine Museum in Athens proved the authenticity of the signature.  His signature was ΧΕΙΡ ΝΙΚΟΛΑΟΥ ΤΟΥ ΛΑΜΠΟΥΔΗ, ΣΠAPTIATOY

The lab was designed by Liu Hong of the Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics (BUAA). The lab is a type of bioregenerative life support system (BLSS), the third built in the world and the first in China.

With a crew of three, 55% of the food consumed is to be produced internally, balanced by reserves. The oxygen would be regenerated through the vegetation compartment, and the water is to be recycled internally. The crew's waste was composted.

Construction on the facility began in March 2013. The facility was unveiled on the Chinese New Year (31 January 2014). It was commissioned prior to the first mission starting in February 2014.

Missions

2014 - First research mission 
The first research mission was the Integrative Experimental Facility ""Lunar Palace 1"" for Permanent Astrobase Life-support Artificial Closed Ecosystem (PALACE) Research (aka ""Lunar Palace-1""), a 105-day mission of three researchers. The one man, Dong Chen, and two women, Xie Beizhen and Wang Minjuan, volunteers from the BUAA, conducted the first long-duration research project of this kind in China, 3 February to 20 May 2014.

The crew grew five cereals, including wheat, corn, soybeans, peanuts and lentils; 15 vegetables, including carrots, cucumbers and  water spinach; and one fruit, strawberries. The wheat provided the main source of calories and the primary source of oxygen. Meat was the primary foodstock; however, meat was grown, in the form of yellow mealworms, the crew's primary protein source.

The diet studied was to determine if a space crew could subsist on a high protein diet with vegetables and mealworms. The mealworms, composed of 3/4 protein, were chosen due to a United Nations study recommending them as a food source for the poor and undernourished; however, it was met with resistance from Western astronauts. They have a tendency to escape confinement. Mealworms reached the size of fingers in weeks. The mealworms were fed the leftover and inedible parts of the produce.

The mission's ecological system was to be a testbed for the controlled ecological life support system (CELSS) for the permanent Chinese space station of the China Manned Space Engineering Office (CSME). The BLSS system used on the mission was at the time the most advanced ever fielded.

2017-2018 Second research mission 
For the second mission, two teams of four volunteers spent 370 days in isolation.

Despite racial discrimination typical of that period, his father Albert Hilgrove Dismont had become a successful businessman and was the first black man to own a property and business in the totally white-owned city of Hamilton, Bermuda's capital. In 1988, his other son Cecil became the first black Mayor of the city. In 2003, the road 'Dismont Drive' was named in his honour, in recognition of his service and the family's contribution to Bermuda.

Russell began his education at the Berkeley Preparatory School and the Excelsior Secondary School in his native Bermuda. He developed an early interest in literature, music, and art which he later pursued in the United States at the New York School of Art. A keen sportsman, he was a well-known tennis player and cricketer for St Georges Cricket Club (Bermuda), which he helped form. While studying law at the London School of Economics in England, he played for the University of London and once with Sir Garfield Sobers. During this period, he often socialised and talked politics with actors Earl Cameron and Sidney Poitier and the founding father of the Kenyan nation, Jomo Kenyatta.

Upon his return to Bermuda, he won many local tennis championships. Despite this, because of being ""coloured"", he was permitted to play at the island's tennis clubs only twice a year. Ignoring this rule, on one occasion, he and African-American tennis legend Althea Gibson were ordered off the court. They both faked deafness and continued their game. As a consequence, Mr Dismont was later refused access to the premises completely. In the 1950s, he, William E. R. Joell and others founded the All Bermuda Tennis Club for all people, irrelevant of their skin colour. To continue the interests of the black tennis players, the Somers Isle Lawn Tennis Association was created, of which Mr Dismont was a member.

He began his professional career as an educator and taught at the elementary level at the Central School and later Harrington Sound School. He subsequently became a businessman and operated a shop located in his father's A.H. Dismont Building.

He was becoming increasingly affected and concerned with the racial inequality on the island and was involved in a number of personal and group protests against the social injustices. In 1963, he was elected as one of the first six Members of Colonial Parliament for the newly created Bermudian Progressive Labour Party (PLP). The party was primarily concerned with those issues that affected the ""coloured"" population and the poor. It called for equitable taxation, the removal of racial discrimination, greater economic parity, the implementation of programmes for healthcare, insurance and pensions. In addition, it called for better housing, improved educational opportunities and electoral reform. During a temporary disenchantment with the Party, he started another – the Bermuda Democratic Party – but later returned and remained a staunch, lifelong supporter of the PLP. On 9 November 1998, the party achieved its ultimate goal and won its first General Election.

His interest in celebrating and preserving the island's culture led him to acquire the magazine Fame (Bermuda). It catered largely to the black community, who had been mostly ignored by other local publications. He remained the publisher and editor for many years.

He has two sons from two of his four marriages: Derek Dismont and Saul Dismont. While at university in Florida, United States, Derek was involved with the Black Panthers. Saul is the nephew of actor Leigh Lawson and Twiggy, and cousin of Crispian Mills, the singer of English rock group Kula Shaker. For a period, Saul was lead singer of the band under its previous name, The Kays. He was a successful club DJ in England (aka DJ Kemosabe) and is now a barrister.

Description
Cotoneaster horizontalis is a short shrub with a spreading habit, growing to  tall by  wide. It is cultivated for its flat, symmetrical sprays of glossy green, deciduous leaves 6 to 12 mm long and masses of bright red berries (pomes) in autumn, persisting into winter. The flowers appear in summer, and can range from pink to white. It is commonly grown in parks and gardens in temperate regions as hedging or groundcover.

Distribution
Cotoneaster horizontalis is native to mountains of Nepal, China, and Taiwan; in China it occurs from Tibet and Yunnan in the west to Jiangsu and Zhejiang in the east and is absent from the north and the very south. It has naturalised in parts of the United Kingdom, and may be becoming invasive. It has been recorded from Counties Down, Antrim and Dublin in Ireland.  

This plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.

Biography

Adolf of Schauenburg was born on January 19, 1511 and baptized on 3 February. He was the son of Jobst I, Count of Holstein-Schauenburg and his wife Maria of Nassau-Dillenburg.  

As a younger son, Adolf was groomed for a life in the church from a young age. From 1522 he studied at Leuven. He became a canon of Liège Cathedral on September 2, 1528, and then provost of the cathedral on May 30, 1533. In 1529, he also became a canon of Mainz Cathedral and, on December 23, 1529, of Cologne Cathedral. He became dean of St. Gereon's Basilica, and then its provost in 1533.

With his father's death in 1531, Adolf returned to Schaumburg to act as his younger brothers' guardian. He played a role in the governance of Schaumburg until 1544.

In the early 1530s, the Archbishop of Cologne, Hermann of Wied, grew increasingly sympathetic to the Protestant Reformation. To try to curb the archbishop's influence, on December 17, 1533, the cathedral chapter of Cologne Cathedral elected Adolf to be the coadjutor bishop of Cologne. He was to be a conservative counterweight to Hermann's attempted reforms.  

On June 3, 1543, Pope Paul III wrote to Adolf encouraging him to be vigilant in his efforts against the archbishop. The pope excommunicated Hermann on July 3, 1546, naming Adolf the administrator of the archdiocese in his stead. The cathedral chapter elected Adolf as Archbishop of Cologne on January 24, 1547. He was ordained as a priest by Bishop Johann Nopel on May 3, 1547.

Adolf's first task was to roll back the reforms initiated by his predecessor. Hermann had installed Martin Bucer, but Adolf now banned Protestant preaching throughout the archdiocese. Accompanied by Eberhard Billick, provincial superior of the Carmelites, Adolf attended the Diet of Augsburg in 1547–48. He was ordained a bishop on April 8, 1548, in the presence of Pope Paul III and Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor. He attended the 1551 session of the Council of Trent, accompanied by Billick and Johann Gropper.

Adolf died in Brühl on September 20, 1556. Cornelis Floris de Vriendt created matching tombs for Adolf and his younger brother Anton of Schauenburg (d. 1558) in Cologne Cathedral. Originally located in the choir, they were relocated to the radiating chapels in 1863.

Greg Harris was drafted by the San Diego Padres out of Elon University in the 10th round of the 1985 amateur draft. Harris threw a no-hitter while playing for the Wichita Pilots, the AA affiliate of the Padres in 1987, and was named the organization's Minor League Pitcher of the Year. Primarily a relief pitcher in his early days with the Padres, he transitioned back into the starting rotation in 1991. His go-to pitch was a big, sweeping curveball, the best in the National League at the time. His career 2.95 ERA with the Padres is still one of the best ERAs in team history, only surpassed by Trevor Hoffman.

Harris and fellow pitcher Bruce Hurst were shipped off to the Colorado Rockies during the Padres 1993 fire sale, and later finished his career in Minnesota.

Harris' post-career San Diego superior court cases detailed scams and conspiracies that led to financial mismanagement and botched surgeries on his pitching arm and shoulder. The first case, against his surgeon, ended in 1999 with a $6 million verdict in Harris' favor. The second case ended in 2005 with a jury verdict awarding Harris $10 million in damages.

During his career, Harris was often known as Greg W. Harris to differentiate him from fellow pitcher Greg A. Harris, whose career (1981–1995) entirely overlapped his.

Origin

Haplogroup A is believed to have arisen in Asia some 30,000–50,000 years before present. Its ancestral haplogroup was Haplogroup N. However, the extant diversity of mitochondrial genomes that belong to Haplogroup A is low relative to the degree of divergence from its nearest outgroups in haplogroup N, which suggests that extant members of Haplogroup A might be descended from a population that has emerged from a bottleneck approximately 20,000 years ago.

Its highest frequencies are among Native Americans, its largest overall population is in East Asia, and its greatest variety (which suggests its origin point) is in East Asia. Thus, it might have originated in and spread from the Far East.

Distribution
Its subclade A2 shares a T16362C mutation with subclades A1 (found in Japan, Tashkurgan, Veliky Novgorod, Mongols, and Altaians), A6 (found in Tibet and in the Yangtze River basin), A12'23 (found in Siberia and among Uralic and Turkic peoples), A13'14 (found in southern Siberia, Xinjiang, Ladakh, China, Yunnan, Thailand, and Vietnam), A15 (found in China, Naxi, Uyghur, Japan, and among the Sherpa of Tibet and Nepal), A16 (found in Uyghur, Buryat, Turkey), A17 (found in China, Miao, Yi, Tibet, Ladakh, Kyrgyz, Thailand, and Vietnam), A18 (found in China), A19 (found in China), A20 (found among Han Chinese and in Japan), A21 (found in Tibet and in Jammu and Kashmir), A22 (found in China), A24 (found in Beijing and West Bohemia), A25 (found in Japan and Yakutia), and A26 (found in Denmark). A2 is found in Chukotko–Kamchatka and is also one of five mtDNA haplogroups found in the indigenous peoples of the Americas, the others being B, C, D, and X.

Haplogroup A2 is the most common haplogroup among the Inuit, Na-Dene, and many Amerind ethnic groups of North and Central America. Lineages belonging to haplogroup A2 also comprise the majority of the mtDNA pool of the Inuit and their neighbors, the Chukchis, in northeasternmost Siberia.

Other branches of haplogroup A are less frequent but widespread among other populations of Asia. Haplogroup A5 is rather limited to populations from Korea and Japan southward, though it has been detected as singletons in a pair of large samples of Khamnigans (1/99 = 1.0%) and Buryats (1/295 = 0.3%) from the Buryat Republic.

In Asia, A(xA2) is especially frequent in Tibeto-Burman-speaking populations of Southwest China, such as Tibetans (6/65 = 9.2%, 25/216 = 11.6%, 11/73 = 15.1%). Approximately 7% to 15% of Koreans belong to haplogroup A. Approximately 5% to 12% of the Japanese belong to haplogroup A (including A4, A5, and A(xA4, A5)). Approximately 4% to 13% of Mongols belong to haplogroup A, almost all of whom are contained within the A4 subclade (2/47 = 4.3% Mongolians from Ulan Bator in haplogroup A4, 4/48 = 8.3% Mongols from New Barag Left Banner in haplogroup A(xA5), 6/47 = 12.8% Mongolians from Ulan Bator in haplogroup A4). Approximately 3% to 9% of Chinese people belong to haplogroup A. Haplogroup A also has been found in Vietnamese (2/42 = 4.8%, including one A4 and one A5(xA5a)). Approximately 4% (3/71) of Tatars from Aznakayevo, 3% (4/126) of Tatars from Buinsk, and 2% of Turkish people belong to haplogroup A. Haplogroup A4 has been found in 2.4% (2/82) of a sample of Persians from eastern Iran and in 2.3% (1/44) of a sample of Tajiks from Tajikistan. Haplogroup A is not found among Austronesians.

Popular culture
The mummy ""Juanita"" of Peru, also called the ""Ice Maiden"", has been shown to belong to mitochondrial haplogroup A.

In his popular book The Seven Daughters of Eve, Bryan Sykes named the originator of this mtDNA haplogroup Aiyana.

Eva Longoria, an American actress of Mexican descent, belongs to Haplogroup A2.

She danced with the Royal Ballet (1980–1984), American Ballet Theatre (1985–2007) and La Scala Theatre Ballet (1992–2007) and as an international guest artist, before temporally retiring on 10 August 2007, aged 44, then returning in 2013. She was eventually granted the rank of prima ballerina assoluta.

Career
Alessandra Ferri was born in Milan, Italy. She began studying ballet at the La Scala Theatre Ballet School, later transferring to the upper school of the Royal Ballet School.  She represented the Royal Ballet School in the 1980 Prix de Lausanne, winning a scholarship which enabled her to continue studying at the school.

Royal Ballet
Ferri joined the Royal Ballet in 1980, and in 1982, for her first major role in the ballet Mayerling, she was nominated for the Laurence Olivier Award for Outstanding First Achievement of the Year in Ballet.  In 1983, she was nominated for and won the Laurence Olivier Award for Outstanding Individual Performance of the Year in a New Dance Production for her role in Sir Kenneth MacMillan's Valley of Shadows.  In 1983, she was promoted to the rank of Principal Dancer.

American Ballet Theatre
In 1985, Ferri left the Royal Ballet at the request of Mikhail Baryshnikov to become a Principal Dancer with American Ballet Theatre, under Baryshnikov's own direction. She stated that she needed a more rigorous training program that the company could provide. In 2007 she brought Roberto Bolle to dance opposite her in her farewell performance of Romeo and Juliet.

La Scala Theatre Ballet
In 1992, Ferri became a Guest Star of American Ballet Theatre and began a very close collaboration with La Scala Theatre Ballet, becoming recognised as Prima Ballerina Assoluta of the company.

Return from retirement
She returned to dance after retirement in 2013, starring in The Piano Upstairs at Spoleto. Performances since have included Lea in Cheri for Signature Theatre, The Raven for Gotham Chamber Opera and in Woolf Works with Royal Ballet.

In June 2017, she appeared at the Royal Opera House in the ballet Marguerite and Armand.

373,"['Sidney Coleman show the Thirringed model is S - dual to the sine - Gordon model .', 'and Elliot H. Lieb , proveed in 1965 , that electrons could be modeled as bosonic interactions .']","In theoretical condensed matter physics and quantum field theory, bosonization is a mathematical procedure by which a system of interacting fermions in (1+1) dimensions can be transformed to a system of massless, non-interacting bosons.
 The method of bosonization was conceived independently by particle physicists Sidney Coleman and Stanley Mandelstam; and condensed matter physicists Daniel C. Mattis and Alan Luther in 1975.

In particle physics, however, the boson is interacting, cf, the Sine-Gordon model, and  notably through topological interactions,  cf. Wess–Zumino–Witten model.

The basic physical idea behind bosonization is that particle-hole excitations are bosonic in character. However, it was shown by Tomonaga in 1950 that this principle is only valid in one-dimensional systems. Bosonization is an effective field theory that focuses on low-energy excitations.

Mathematical descriptions 

A pair of chiral fermions , one being the conjugate variable of the other, can be described in terms of a chiral boson 

where the currents of these two models are related by

where composite operators must be defined by a regularization and a subsequent renormalization.

Examples

In particle physics 
The standard example in particle physics, for a Dirac field in (1+1) dimensions, is the equivalence between the massive Thirring model (MTM) and the quantum Sine-Gordon model. Sidney Coleman showed the Thirring model is S-dual to the sine-Gordon model. The fundamental fermions of the Thirring model correspond to the solitons (bosons) of the sine-Gordon model.

In condensed matter 
The Luttinger liquid model, proposed by Tomonaga and reformulated by J.M. Luttinger, describes electrons in one-dimensional electrical conductors under second-order interactions.  and Elliot H. Lieb, proved in 1965, that electrons could be modeled as bosonic interactions. The response of the electron density to an external perturbation can be treated as plasmonic waves. This model predicts the emergence of spin–charge separation.

Eucalyptus quaerenda is a mallee that typically grows to a height of  and forms a lignotuber. It often has a rounded shape with foliage reaching to the ground. Young plants and coppice regrowth have sessile leaves   long and  wide, those near the ground a duller green than the upper leaves.

The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils on an unbranched peduncle  long, the individual buds sessile or on pedicels up to  long. Mature buds are oval,  long and  wide with a rounded or conical operculum. Flowering has been observed in September and the flowers are creamy white. The fruit is a woody, shallow cup-shaped to flattened spherical capsule  long and  wide with the valves near rim level.

Taxonomy
This mallee was first formally described in 1992 by Lawrie Johnson and Ken Hill from a specimen collected near Lake Chinocup in 1986. They gave it the name Eucalyptus angustissima subsp. quaerenda and published the description in the journal Telopea. In 2004, Margaret Mary Byrne raised the subspecies to species status as E. quaerenda in the journal Nuytsia and the change has been accepted by the Australian Plant Census.

Distribution and habitat
This mallee is usually found on sandhills and flats and occurs near Lake Chinocup, Lake Altham, Lake King and the upper reaches of the Phillips River in the Esperance Plains, Jarrah Forest and Mallee biogeographic regions.

Conservation status
This eucalypt is only known from fewer than five populations and it is classified as ""Priority Three"" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife, meaning that it is poorly known and known from only a few locations but is not under imminent threat.

She is professor of sociology and gender studies at Brock University, and holds the Canada Research Chair in gender, work and care. She was also the editor of the academic journal Fathering.

Early life
Doucet was born in Bathurst, New Brunswick, Canada in 1960, where she grew up in an anglophone family. Her sister is BBC journalist Lyse Doucet .

Education
Doucet completed her BA in political theory at York University in Toronto and her MA in international development studies at Carleton University. She earned her PhD in social and political sciences in 1995 from Cambridge University.

Career
In 1995 and 1996 Doucet was a post doctoral fellow and lecturer at Cambridge. From 1995 to 1998 she was an assistant professor of sociology at St. Mary's University in Halifax, Nova Scotia. At Carleton University, she was professor of sociology from 1998 to 2011.

She has been professor of sociology and gender studies at Brock University since 2011. She has also held the Canada Research Chair in gender, work and care since 2011. Doucet is recognized as an ""expert in caregiving and work-life balance"".

She was an editor of the now defunct academic journal, Fathering: a Journal of Theory, Research, and Practice about Men as Fathers.

In 2009, as sociology professor at Carleton University in Ottawa, Ontario, Doucet undertook a study entitled ""Bread and Roses Project"" in which she tracked couples in which women were the primary earners using data from both Canada and the United States. In a 2010 interview with The New York Times, Doucet observed that, ""With women taking on more earning and men taking on more caring, there's a lot of shifting and juggling. You can't just reverse the genders."" In an interview with the New York Post Doucet explained that ""The ambiguity over who does what, and its accompanying stress, is to be expected as gender roles change.""The 'mancession' has been difficult on couples. Many have told me that they did not expect to be in this situation. To suddenly have it sprung upon you because of job loss can lead to a rapid and stress-filled learning curve for both men and women."" In her project  Bread and Roses — And the Kitchen Sink, Doucet said, ""It's been just a steady progression of women's education going up and employment going up, but then quite a remarkable leap in women being primary breadwinners or shared primary breadwinners relates to the changes in the economy.""

Research
From 1998-2002 she was the principal investigator of ""Fathers as Primary Caregivers"" which received a Canada Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC), the Canadian federal research funding agency.

Plot summary
It is summer 1813. Lord Wellington (Hugh Fraser) is preparing to invade France from Spain after winning the campaign on the Iberian peninsula.

Meanwhile, Major Richard Sharpe (Sean Bean) gets into serious trouble when he tries unsuccessfully to save one of his riflemen, Skillicorn (Philip Dowd), from being executed by the zealous Lieutenant Ayres (Ian Shaw) for stealing a chicken. To maintain discipline in his army, Wellington makes Sharpe apologise to Ayres.

Bess Nugent (Rosaleen Linehan) and her daughter Ellie (Jayne Ashbourne), arrive unannounced from Ireland to visit their cousin, Wellington. They are there to search for Bess's husband, Will (Peter Eyre). Wellington refuses to assist their foolhardy mission, demanding they go home. Sharpe and Ellie find themselves attracted to each other, and they engage in a friendly shooting match at 100 yards. Several of the officers and men place bets on the contest; surprisingly Sharpe only narrowly prevails.

Wellington assigns Sharpe the task of handing over 50 rifles in exchange for some British deserters caught by a feared Spanish guerrilla leader named El Casco (Abel Folk). The Provost Marshal insists that some of his men go along, so Sharpe is saddled with Ayres. Later, the two ladies catch up to Sharpe's detachment, forcing him to take them along for their protection. On the way, they repel an attack by French cavalry led by Lieutenant Barbier (Julian Sims). Ellie becomes distraught after having to shoot and kill a young Frenchman. When Sharpe tries to comfort her away from the others, they embrace.

The trade goes as planned. However, Ellie then discovers that one of the deserters has her father's pipe. When Sharpe refuses to begin a search, the Nugents ride off, forcing Sharpe to go after them. The riflemen spot Barbier's detachment and drive them off with a surprise attack.

The ladies encounter El Casco's men; Bess is killed and Ellie taken captive. When she is taken to El Casco's cave lair, she finds her father, though he has become deranged. Sharpe tracks them down with the help of Barbier, whose men were captured and had their hearts cut out while still alive by the partisans (who believe they are descendants of shipwrecked Aztecs). Sharpe attacks the Spaniards and rescues Ellie and her father. El Casco kills Ayres and wounds Sharpe, but is killed by Sergeant Harper (Daragh O'Malley). Back at camp, Will recovers his senses and thanks Sharpe.

Production
According to Jason Salkey, who played Rifleman Harris, the episode was originally cast with different actors, and had to be re-scripted to avoid paying this original cast as well. This is one reason it differs greatly from the book, and is not thought highly of by lead actor Sean Bean.

It is located in an area colonised by the Carthaginians and then by the Romans, attracted by its silver and lead deposits.

It consists of a Roman temple, under whose steps are the remains of the Carthaginian one, which was dedicated to the god Sid Addir, a later incarnation of the local god Sardus Pater Babai, the main male divinity of the Nuragic civilization.

The original temple had been built around 500 BC over a sacred limestone outcrop, and restored around 300 BC. The Roman temple was built by emperor Augustus (27 BC - 14 AD) and restored under Caracalla (213-217 AD). If still in use by the 4th-and 5th century, it would have been closed during the persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire.  

Its remains were discovered in 1836 by general Alberto La Marmora, and rebuilt to the current status in 1967.

The fore section of the temple includes six columns, with a height of some 8 metres, with Ionic capitals. Originally a triangular pediment was also present. The cella was accessed through two side openings and had a mosaic-covered pavement, part of which has been preserved. The temple was provided with two square reservoirs, which housed the water for the sacred rites of purification.

It is likely that a statue of the Sardus Pater was housed in the cella. According to the size of the only remain found, a finger, it has been estimated that it was some 3 metres high.

The archaeological area of temple includes a small necropolis, remains of an ancient Nuragic village (13th-10th centuries BC), Roman quarries of limestone and an ancient path connecting the temple to a sacred cave where the water cult was practised.

388,['Hart serve in the Americaned Revolutionary War and was later a candidate for Governor of Connecticut .'],"The Gen. William Hart House is a historic house at 350 Main Street in Old Saybrook, Connecticut.  Built in 1767 for a politician and colonial militia leader, it is a good example of Georgian residential architecture.  The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972, and is a contributing property to the Old Saybrook South Green historic district.

Description and history
The General William Hart House stands on the east of Main Street (Connecticut Route 154) just south of the Grace Church in a residential portion of the village center of Old Saybrook.  It is a -story wood-frame structure, five bays wide, with a gabled roof, clapboarded exterior, and two end chimneys.  It has a center entry sheltered by a gable-roofed portico supported by Doric columns.  The interior follows a central hall plan, and retains a number of original features, including fireplace surrounds.

The house was built in 1767 by William Hart, Jr., a merchant, around the time of his marriage.  Hart served in the American Revolutionary War and was later a candidate for Governor of Connecticut.  The house was used later in the 19th century for a boarding school.  It is one of a number of well-preserved houses from the period in the residential area south of the commercial center of Old Saybrook.

Also located on the site are the Frank Stevenson Archives and the Hart House Gardens. The house and property are currently owned by the Old Saybrook Historical Society.

He received a legal education and entered the Austrian ministry of finance where he found speedy promotion. In 1805 and in 1809, when Austria was under the heel of Napoleon, Collin was entrusted with important political missions. In 1803 he was, together with other members of his family, ennobled, and in 1809 made Hofrat. He died on 28 July 1811 in Vienna.

His tragedy Regulus (1801), written in strict classical form, was received with enthusiasm in Vienna, where literary taste, less advanced than that of northern Germany, was still under the ban of French classicism. But in his later dramas, Coriolan (1804), Polyxena (1804), Balboa (1806), and Bianca della Porta (1808), he made some attempt to reconcile the pseudo-classic type of tragedy with that of Shakespeare and the German romanticists. As a lyric poet (Gedichte, collected 1812), Collin has left a collection of stirring Wehrmannslieder for the fighters in the cause of Austrian freedom, as well as some excellent ballads (Kaiser Max auf der Martinswand, Herzog Leupold vor Solothurn).

His younger brother Matthäus von Collin (1779–1824), was, as editor of the Wiener Jahrbücher für Literatur, an even more potent force in the literary life of Vienna. He was, moreover, in sympathy with the Romantic movement, and intimate with its leaders. His dramas on themes from Austrian national history (Belas Krieg mit dem Vater, (1808); Der Tod Friedrichs des Streitbaren, 1813) may be regarded as the immediate precursors of Grillparzer's historical tragedies.

Heinrich's Gesammelte Werke appeared in 6 vols. (1812–1814); he is the subject of an excellent monograph by F. Laban (1879). See also A. Hauffen, Des Drama der klassischen Periode, ii.2 (1891), where a reprint of Regulus will be found. M. von Collins Dramatische Dichtungen were published in 4 vols. (1815-1817); his Nachgelassene Schriften, edited by J. von Hammer, in 2 vols. (1827). A study of his life and work by J. Wihan will be found in Euphorion, Erganzungsheft, v (1901).

The game revolves around a freelance investigative journalist, Miles Upshur, who decides to investigate a remote psychiatric hospital named Mount Massive Asylum, located deep in the mountains of Lake County, Colorado. The downloadable content Outlast: Whistleblower centers on Waylon Park, the man who led Miles there in the first place.

Outlast was released for Microsoft Windows on September 4, 2013, PlayStation 4 on February 4, 2014, and for Xbox One on June 19, 2014.  Linux and OS X versions were later released on March 31, 2015. A Nintendo Switch version titled Outlast: Bundle of Terror was released in February 2018.

Outlast received generally positive reviews, with praise for its atmosphere, horror elements, and gameplay. , the game has sold 4 million copies. As of May 2018, the whole series has sold 15 million copies. A sequel, Outlast 2, was released on April 25, 2017, while a third installment, The Outlast Trials, is set to be released in 2022. The Murkoff Account, a comic book series set between Outlast and Outlast 2, was released from July 2016 to November 2017.

Gameplay 

In Outlast, the player assumes the role  of investigative journalist Miles Upshur, as he navigates a dilapidated psychiatric hospital in Leadville, Colorado that is overrun by homicidal patients. The game is played from a first-person perspective and features some stealth gameplay mechanics. The player can walk, run, crouch, jump, climb ladders and vault over objects. Unlike most games, however, the player does not have a visible health bar on the screen and is unable to attack enemies. The player must instead rely on stealth tactics such as hiding in lockers, sneaking past enemies, staying in the shadows and hiding behind or under things in order to survive. Alternatively, the player can attempt to outrun their pursuer. If the player dies, the game will reset to the most recent checkpoint.

Most of the hospital is unlit, and the only way for the player to see while in the dark is through the lens of a camcorder equipped with night vision. Using the night vision mode will slowly consume batteries, of which there are not many, forcing the player to scavenge for additional batteries found throughout the asylum. Outlast makes heavy use of traditional jump scares and audio cues, which alert the player if an enemy has seen them. If the player records specific events with their camcorder, Miles will write a note about it, providing further insight into his thoughts. Documents can be collected, which offer backstory and other expository  information about the facility,  including pages taken from the diaries of patients and reports from the hospital staff.

Developer Red Barrels have pointed to the survival-focused gameplay in Amnesia: The Dark Descent as a primary influence on the combat-free narrative style of Outlast. Found-footage horror films like Quarantine and REC also served as influences.

Plot
Freelance investigative journalist Miles Upshur receives an anonymous e-mail that inhumane experiments are being conducted at Mount Massive Asylum, a private psychiatric hospital owned by the notoriously unethical Murkoff Corporation. Upon entering, Miles is shocked to discover its halls ransacked and littered with the mutilated corpses of the staff. He's informed by a dying officer of Murkoff's private military unit that Mount Massive's deranged inmates, known as ""variants"", have escaped and are freely roaming the grounds, butchering Murkoff's employees. The officer implores Miles to escape and reveals that the main doors can be unlocked from security control.

Moving on, Miles is suddenly ambushed by a hulking variant named Chris Walker, who knocks him unconscious. While incapacitated, Miles encounters Father Martin Archimbaud, a self-appointed priest with schizotypal personality disorder, who claims Miles is his ""apostle"" and sabotages his escape by cutting off power to the front doors. Miles restores power, but Father Martin injects him with anesthetic. He shows Miles footage of ""the Walrider"", a ghostly entity killing patients and personnel alike, which he claims is responsible for the asylum's ransacking.

Regaining consciousness, Miles finds himself trapped in a decaying cell block filled with catatonic and demented patients. He escapes through the sewers to the main wards, pursued by Walker and two cannibalistic twins, only to be captured by Richard Trager, a former Murkoff executive driven insane. Trager amputates two of Miles' fingers with a pair of bone shears, preparing to do the same to his tongue and genitals. However, Miles escapes to an elevator, inadvertently crushing Trager to death between floors when he attacks him.

Miles reconvenes with Father Martin, who tells him to go to the asylum's chapel. Reaching an auditorium, Miles learns that the Walrider was created by Dr. Rudolf Gustav Wernicke, a German scientist brought to the U.S. during Operation Paperclip. Wernicke believed that intensive dream therapy conducted on traumatized patients could connect swarms of nanites into a single malevolent being.

In the chapel, Miles finds a crucified Father Martin, who gives Miles a key to the atrium elevator that he insists will take him to freedom before immolating himself. Miles takes the elevator, which descends into a subterranean laboratory. Walker attacks him, only to be eviscerated by the Walrider. Miles locates an aged Wernicke, who confirms that the Walrider is a biotechnological nanite entity controlled by Billy Hope, a comatose subject of Murkoff's experiments. He orders Miles to terminate Billy's life support in the hopes that this will destroy the Walrider. Miles accomplishes this task; however, just before Billy dies, the Walrider attacks Miles and possesses his body. On his way out of the laboratory, Miles encounters a Murkoff military team led by Wernicke, which guns him down. A horrified Wernicke realizes that Miles is the Walrider's new host. Panicked screams and gunfire are heard as the screen fades to black.

Whistleblower
Waylon Park is a software engineer working at M.M.A.  for Murkoff. His job entails maintaining the Morphogenic Engine, which controls lucid dreaming in comatose individuals. After several experiences working directly with the Engine and witnessing its effects on the facility's patients, he desperately sends an anonymous e-mail to reporter Miles Upshur to expose the corporation. Shortly afterwards, Park is summoned to the underground laboratory's operations center to debug a monitoring system. When he returns to his laptop, his supervisor, Jeremy Blaire, has him detained and subjected to the Morphogenic Engine after discovering his e-mail. However, Park escapes his restraints when the Walrider is unleashed. He roams the increasingly decrepit facility as surviving guards and medical personnel flee from the newly freed patients, searching for a shortwave radio that he can use to contact the authorities, all the while eluding a cannibal named Frank Manera, who wields an electric bone saw. Just as Park manages to find a working radio transmitter, Blaire appears and destroys it.

Park finds his way into the asylum's vocational block where he is captured by Eddie Gluskin, a serial killer obsessed with finding the ""perfect bride"" by killing other patients and mutilating their genitalia. Gluskin tries to hang Park in a gymnasium with his other victims, but during the struggle, he is entangled by his own pulley system and fatally impaled by a loose section of rebar.

At daybreak, Murkoff's paramilitary division arrives at the asylum, intent on eliminating the variants. Park slips past them and escapes into the main lobby. There, he finds a gravely wounded Blaire, who stabs him suddenly, insisting that no one can know the truth about Mount Massive, but the Walrider kills him before he can kill Park. Park then stumbles out the open front door and towards Miles Upshur's jeep, which is still idling near the main gates. He takes the jeep and drives away as Miles, now the Walrider's host, also emerges from the asylum.

In the epilogue, Park is sitting at a laptop with his camcorder footage ready for upload in order to expose the Murkoff Corporation. An associate informs him that it will be more than enough to ruin Murkoff, but is warned that they will then seek to eliminate him and his family. Despite some initial hesitation, Park decides to upload the file.

Development
Outlast was Red Barrels' first game, although the team had worked on big AAA games in Ubisoft prior like Prince of Persia, Assassin’s Creed, Splinter Cell and Uncharted. The game was made in 14 months with a team of 10 people. Red Barrels' CEO Philippe Morin said in 2018 that they initially could not find anyone to invest on the project for 18 months, which means 18 months without salary. Fortunately, they were able to get the funding from Canada Media Fund for $1.36 million CAD.

Release 
Outlast was released on September 4, 2013, for download through Steam, and it was released on February 4, 2014, for the PlayStation 4 as the free monthly title for PlayStation Plus users.

The downloadable content, Outlast: Whistleblower, serves as an overlapping prequel to the original game. The plot follows Waylon Park, the anonymous tipster to Miles Upshur and shows the events both before and after the main plotline. The Microsoft Windows version of Whistleblower was released on May 6, 2014, worldwide, the PlayStation 4 version was launched on May 6, 2014, in North America and on May 7, 2014, in Europe, and the Xbox One version launched on June 18 in North America and Europe.  Linux and OS X versions were later released on March 31, 2015.

In December 2017, Red Barrels announced that Outlast, including Whistleblower and the sequel Outlast 2, would be coming to the Nintendo Switch in early 2018. The title was released by surprise on February 27, 2018, under the title Outlast: Bundle of Terror via Nintendo eShop.

Reception 

, Outlast has sold over 4 million copies.

Outlast received positive reviews. Aggregating review website Metacritic gave the Xbox One version 80/100 based on 6 reviews, the Microsoft Windows version 80/100 based on 59 reviews, and the PlayStation 4 version 78/100 based on 33 reviews. It has been received with a number of accolades and awards from E3 2013, including the ""Most Likely to Make you Faint"" honor, and one of ""Best of E3"".

The PC gaming website Rock, Paper, Shotgun gave Outlast a very positive review, noting that ""Outlast is not an experiment in how games can be scary, it’s an exemplification."" Marty Sliva of IGN rated the game with a score of 7.8, praising the horror elements and gameplay while criticizing the environments and character modeling.

GameSpot gave the game a positive review as well stating that ""Outlast isn't really a game of skill, and as it turns out, that makes sense. You're not a cop or a soldier or a genetically enhanced superhero. You're just a reporter. And as a reporter, you don't possess many skills with which you can fend off the hulking brutes, knife-wielding stalkers, and other homicidal maniacs who lurk in the halls of the dilapidated Mount Massive Asylum. You can't shoot them, or punch them, or rip pipes from the walls to clobber them with. You can only run and hide"".

Sequels 

On October 23, 2014, in an interview with Bloody Disgusting, Red Barrels revealed that due to the success of Outlast, a sequel was in development.

It was initially intended to be released in late 2016, but was delayed to early 2017 due to complications during development. Subsequently, the release date was further pushed to Q2 2017, despite the intended Q1 2017 release.

On March 6, 2017, Red Barrels announced that a physical bundle called Outlast Trinity would be released for Xbox One and PlayStation 4 on April 25.

The sequel, titled Outlast 2, was made digitally available for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on April 25, 2017; and came to the Nintendo Switch, alongside Outlast, in February 2018. It takes place in the same universe as the first game, but features a new storyline with different characters, set in the Arizona desert.

Outlast 3 was announced in December 2017, though no time frame or target platforms were confirmed. During this announcement, Red Barrels said that because they could not easily add downloadable content for Outlast 2, they had a smaller separate project related to Outlast that would be released before Outlast 3. The project, teased in October 2019, is a prequel for Outlast 2, called The Outlast Trials, and is a horror game set in the Cold War. The game is in its early development stages, with a set 2022 release date.

It was meant as a parody of split supersymmetry.

The model proposed particles (beyond those of the Standard Model) which are decoupled, leaving no trace at low energies, therefore leaving just the Standard Model.   The paper argued that the 30% accuracy of gauge coupling unification in the Standard Model is on par with the 1% accuracy in the MSSM or Split Supersymmetry.  It also used the well-known possibility that a Peccei-Quinn axion could be the dark matter of the universe.

As a serious scientific theory, it leads to no new predictions beyond the Standard Model, and is therefore unverifiable.  As a social commentary, it demonstrates the uneasiness in the high energy physics community about the direction some model building is heading.

Despite the original intent as a ridiculous proposal, the original paper has been cited by few theoretical physicists.

Very recently, a paper by Giudice and Strumia has presented the same idea under the name 'high scale supersymmetry'.

Construction 
In the late 1800s, relations between the two countries in the union between Sweden and Norway had gradually worsened. Norwegians were discontented and wanted independence. In case of a violent dissolution of the union, new coastal defenses were built. In Bergen, several forts were built to defend the harbour and the naval installations at Marineholmen and Wallemsviken from Swedish seaborne attacks. Kvarven fort was one of these, along with Hellen Fort and batteries in Sandviken.

Construction of Kvarven Fort began in 1895. The military bought the nearby farm Bakke in 1898, and turned its stately main building into the commander's quarters. The fort construction was completed in 1899. An additional torpedo battery was in place by 1902. This and the Howitzer L/14 cannons made Kvarven a very modern fort for its time, though it did not have to fulfil its intended use as the union with Sweden dissolved peacefully in 1905.

World War I 
Norway was a neutral country in World War I. Kvarven Fort had a full complement of soldiers in order to maintain neutrality.

World War II 
Norway attempted to maintain neutrality during World War II as well, but was invaded by the Germans in their Operation Weserübung on April 9, 1940. The Bergen part of the operation was fronted by cruisers  and , with a total of 1,900 German soldiers. Kvarven fort was manned by 33 officers and 279 corporals and privates with an average age of around forty. The fort failed to open fire at the first German ships of the invasion force, mistaking the armed trawlers Schiff 9 and Schiff 18 for unarmed merchant ships. When the fort finally opened fire at 3:58 in the morning, it only managed to get off a few shots through the fog at two torpedo boats and the cruiser Köln. The ships did not retaliate, but sent a morse coded message in English saying “stop shooting!“. Only the third wave of German ships were taken under effective fire by Kvarven. The fort first hit Bremse twice, then the MTB mothership Carl Peters  once, compelling both ships to break off their attempt to force their way into the harbour. After these ships, the cruiser Königsberg tried to break through and was hit by three shells: one beneath the waterline, one on deck and the third hitting the conning tower. Königsberg was barely saved due to its own counter fire and great technical difficulties up at the fort.

Kvarven surrendered at ca. 07.00 am after a short infantry battle between the German landing forces and Krag–Jørgensen rifle armed gun crews from the fort.
Defence by use of torpedoes was also possible, as Kvarven held one of only two land-based torpedo batteries in Norway at the time, and, after the alarm from detection of German attack at Oslo had gone out, a torpedo boat was maneuvering into position nearby. The other land-based torpedo battery, at Oscarsborg Fortress, defended Oslo against the simultaneous German invasion there and featured underwater release of its torpedoes. It was unknown to German military intelligence. Two obsolete torpedoes from the Oscarsborg Fortress fired at 4:34 am finished off gun-damaged German heavy cruiser Blücher, which finally sank at 07:30 am, just a short while after the Karven fort surrendered. The Karven torpedo battery, on the other hand, was designed to launch its torpedoes by torpedo tube from above ground, and presumably the Germans could have known about it and planned countermeasures in some way, and in fact their landings on both sides of Korven were likely part of that. But according to a Norwegian military history website, no torpedoes in the battery could be fired, because all were missing their fuses and gyroscopes.  Another nearby line of the torpedo defense was just then available: torpedo boat Brand, with fully functioning torpedoes, had moved into an excellent position in the Gravdalsviken inlet partly defined by Kvarven's peninsula, just past, where it would have a 700-1000 meter firing shot opportunity on passing German ships, and it could likely have sunk one or more German ships. But the boat's commander inexplicably chose not to fire any torpedoes and to abandon the boat, instead.  The Brand was used with success by the Germans, with some immunity from air attacks because of confusion on its identity, during the next few days, and also was useful for the duration of their occupation of Norway.

German naval personnel manned the fort for the rest of the war, incorporating it into their Festung Bergen defence. During this period, the fort was extended and modernised.

Today 
The fortress was closed for military use in 1961. Kvarven Fort opened in 1993 as a preserved cultural area open to the public. It is a popular area to explore for tourists and locals alike, and the area is also an entry to Lyderhorn and Ørnafjellet for hikers. It is now a recreational area on the shore of Byfjorden.

The manor was established in 1675 and had the same owners as nearby Holmegaard until 1801. It was then owned by the Post family from 1801 to 1925 and has most recently been owned by the Riegels family since 1931. The current main building is from 1915-16 but its design is inspired by traditional Renaissance style manor houses. The estate covers approximately 1,000 hectares of land.

History

Frans  and Kai Lykke

Broksø was established in 1650 when Frans Lykke merged two farms on Spragelse. a small peninsula surrounded by bogland, naming the estate after his wife Elisabeth Brok. Lykke  was also the owner of the estates Gisselfeld and Rantzausholm. All three estates were after his death in 1657 passed to his son Kai Lykke.

In 1601, Lykke was sentenced to a great fine after accusing Queen  Sophie Amalie of adultery in a letter which was exposed to the king. When he fled to Skåne instead of paying, he was sentenced to death for Lèse-majesté, was executed in his absence and had his property in Denmark confiscated. Gisselfeld, including  Broksø, was initially granted to Crown Prince Christian (V). Broksø and ten other farms were later placed under Holmegaard.

Krabbe, Trolle and Restorff families

In 1670, Frederik III granted Holmegaard to his page, Otto Krabbe. In 1675, Holmegaard and Broksø were both granted status of manors. Krabbe was promoted to chamberlain shortly after Christian V's ascend to the throne. He left the royal court in Copenhagen a few years later when he was appointed to county governor (amtmand) of Tryggevælde. Otto Krabbe's widow, Birgitte Skeel, kept Holmegaard and Broksø after her husband's death in 1719. Their three children had all died in an early age. Birgitte Skeel bequeathed Holmegaard and Broksø to Otto Krabbe's niece, Birgitte Restorff, who married Knud Trolle later that same year. Birgitte Restorff, who outlived her husband by 30 years, kept the estates until her death in 1790.

The Post family

Having no children, Restorff bequeathed  her estates to her niece, Margrethe Elisabeth Restorff, who was married to Peder Lasson von Post. In 1801, he sold Holmegaard and Broksø to Christian Conrad, Count of Danneskiold-Samsøe. In 1802,Peder Lasson von Post's third eldest son, Carl Ludvig Post, bought Broksø back from Danneskiold-Samsøe. He was later succeeded first by his son and later by his grandson as owner of Broksø. His grandson's widow, Margrethe Post, constructed a new main building in 1914-16.

The Madelung and Riegels families

In 1925, Margrethe Post sold Broksø to K. Ekstrøm. The estate was the following year sold to Peter Madelung. Peter Madelung had previously owned Tårnborg at Korsør and Hollufgaard at Odense.

In 1931, Broksø was acquired by Hans Vilhelm Riegels. He had earlier in his life made a fortune in the timber industry working for the East Asiatic Company in the Far East. After his return to Denmark, he had most recently been the managing director of H.C. Christiansen A/S.

Architecture
The current main building from 1915-16 was designed by Gustav Bartholin Hagen. The building consists of two storeys under a tall hip roof clad in red tiles. The walls are white-washed. The front of the building features a three-storey median risalit with a monumental staircase and two lower corner pavilions with hip roofs. The facade towards the gardens feature two projecting, octagonal corner towers with conical red tile roofs.

Avlsgården, a half-timbered complex of farm buildings, fate from before 1850. In 1972, Riegels ceded Broksø to his daughter Charlotte Riegels Hjorth.

Today
The estate has a total area of approximately 1,000 hectares.

Cultural references
 Broksø is mentioned in poems by Christian Winther and Karl Gjellerup.
Broksø has been used as a location in the feature films To som elsker hinanden (1944), Slottet (1964) and Marco effekten'' (2021).

Description
The size of the shell varies between 8 mm and 32 mm. Protoconch is smooth and the shell is brilliant, long, thin and turban-shaped, usually pale brown, reddish or pinkish, marked with variable blotches. It shows four-five rounded whorls. The operculum is white, oval-shaped.

(Description of Phasianella aethiopica) The height of the shell varies between 12 mm and 35 mm. The thick, solid shell has a pointed-ovate shape. The 5–6 whorls are moderately convex, sloping below the sutures. The oblique, ovate aperture is about half the length of shell. The thickened columella has a heavy white or rosy callus, and is subdentate near the posterior angle of the aperture. The color of the shell is light brown or rose, with revolving series of arrow-shapeci or irregular flecks of lighter shade, or with longitudinal oblique light stripes extending downward to middle of body whorl. The apex and the base of the shell are stained with rose color.

(Description of Phasianella variegata Lamarck, 1822) The solid shell grows to a height of 2 cm and has an ovate-conic shape. Its pointed, conic spire is higher and more acute than the spire of Phasianella nivosa. The five, somewhat convex whorls are separated by well marked sutures and are somewhat flattened above. The rather small aperture is short ovate, and measures less than half the length of the shell. It is widely rounded below, and angular above. The columella has a flattened callus. The parietal wall has a more or less white callus, and is decidedly thickened near the posterior angle. The color of the shell is variable, often pale with reddish-brown and white dashes and blotches. It is usually flesh tinted, ashen or brown, more or less clouded with darker and lighter shades, and flammulated with dark and light below the sutures, spirally traversed by narrow hair-like lines of brown or red, interrupted by white dots and intervals. The white is sometimes predominate.

Distribution
This quite common species occurs in the Red Sea, in the Indian Ocean off Madagascar, Tanzania and the Mascarene Basin; off the Aldabra Atoll;in the tropical Indo-West Pacific: off southern Australia, the Philippines, off Java and Japan. It lives at intertidal depths up to 15 m.

Development
The CR-3 was ordered by air racer Johnny Livingston in response to the performance he saw when competing against the Cessna CR-2 in the 1932 National Air Races. The CR-3 was of shoulder-wing design.

Design
The CR-3 was a mid-wing radial engined taildragger racer with manual retractable landing gear and a tail skid. The propeller was from a clipped wing Monocoupe racer #14. The tail surface was designed to be neutral, without downforce in flight. The elevators experienced significant vibration in test flights without the wing root fairings installed.

Operational history

The CR-3 lasted 61 days, winning every event it competed in:

Omaha Air Races at Omaha, Nebraska, June 17, 1933: First place.
Minneapolis Air Races and Minneapolis, Minnesota, June 24, 1933: First place.
American Air Races at Chicago, Illinois, July 1, 1933: The CR-3 first raced against Cessna CR-2 at these races. The CR-3 won the Baby Ruth Trophy at a speed of 201.42 mph (324.35 km/hr). It also set a world speed record for aircraft with engines of under 500-cubic-inches′ (8.2 liters′) capacity at 237.4 mph (382.3 km/hr).
Aero Digest Trophy race, July 4, 1933: First place.

En route to an airshow in August 1933, the CR-3 experienced a failure of both the tail skid and a landing gear weld that would not allow the gear to lock. Livingston bailed out over Columbus, Ohio and the CR-3 was destroyed in its ensuing crash.

The Zodiacs
The Zodiacs were fronted by Freddie Keil on lead vocals. John Murphy was their lead guitarist and Freddie's younger brother Alphonso Keil was the rhythm guitarist. Vic Williams was the drummer and John Harrison the bassist while Jimmy Langabeer played piano. After scuppered plans to record with the La Gloria label, they recorded on the Zodiac Records label. As such, they changed their name from the Zodiacs to the Kavaliers. When they were still called the Zodiacs, while Freddie Keil had returned to Western Samoa for a short time, they were fronted by Terry Dean and the Nitebeats singer, Terry Dean (also known as Terry Fidow).

The Maori Kavaliers
They were a 1960s band that were more or less a spin-off from Freddie Keil & the Kavaliers, rather than an extension of the group. The group consisted of ex Freddie Keil and the Kavaliers members, Brian Smith and Billy Peters. Their name came about because of Smith and Peter's past association with the group.

Alphonso Keil and The Kavalliers
Alphonso Keil, the younger brother of Freddie Keil, was born in Samoa in 1944, and was a child when he came to New Zealand. In the late 1950s, he was the rhythm guitarist for a group called The Sundowners. He also played some guitar for the Keil Isles. He was a cousin of founding members Olaf, Herma, Rudolf and Klaus.  He was also rhythm guitar player for the Zodiacs. His playing can be heard along with Vic Williams,  Jimmy Langabeer and Jimmy Murphy on ""Be Bop A Lula"" that features on the Pie Cart Rock 'n' Roll compilation.   He was also the drummer for Freddie Keil & The Kavaliers. He formed a version of this group many years later in 2002. There were a few different musicians in this line up with lead guitarist Clive Whelan, Alphonso Keil rhythm guitar, drummer Mike Beck, various bass players and Steve Smith on keyboards. Bass guitarist Bruce Jarvis joined in 2006. Instead of the group being called The Kavaliers they were now called The Kavalliers. 

In addition to being member of various New Zealand rock and roll recording groups, Alphonso Keil was an Elvis Presley impersonator, who was inspired by Andy Stankovich, an Elvis tribute artist. Keil was well known for his participation in the annual Elvis in the Park concerts in Henderson, Auckland.  

He died in 2008 at age 64 from cancer, but the rest of the band carried on as The Kavalliers.

The stadium was named after Sergey Kirov.

History
The stands of the Kirov stadium were located on the slopes of a circular artificial mound in the western part of Krestovsky Island, on the coast of the Gulf of Finland. Construction started in 1932, initial project was designed by architect Aleksandr Nikolsky and his workshop. During the 1930s and 1940s, construction was mainly focused on groundworks for the artificial mound on the sea shore. Construction was interrupted by World War II and the Siege of Leningrad, and resumed in 1945 with the return of citizens to Leningrad. Thousands of Red Army and Red Navy recruits were also conscripted as labor force for construction.

The stadium was opened on 30 July 1950 with the game between two main Leningrad teams, Zenit and Dynamo, drew 1-1. Initially the stadium held 100,000 people (including 16,000 standing places).

For the match between Zenit and CSKA on 14 July 1951, additional temporary stands were installed, increasing the capacity of the stadium to 110,000. The stadium was sold out, and the attendance of 110,000 is the record for the Soviet football. Kirov stadium was reconstructed to hold preliminary matches of the football tournament at the 1980 Summer Olympics. The capacity was reduced to 72,000.

In 1994 the stadium was used as the main arena for the St. Petersburg 1994 Goodwill Games. This was the last major international event at the Kirov Stadium, with participation of athletes from over 50 nations of the world. After the Goodwill Games, the stadium was used for several more years for football matches, as well as for athletics and training. In 2005 it was decided to demolish the main arena of the stadium and build a new one in its place. International competition for construction design of the new Zenit Stadium was won by architect Kisho Kurokawa.

The Kirov stadium was the home to Zenit football club in 1950-1989 and 1992. On 6 July 2006 Zenit decided to play a match against Dynamo Moscow at the Kirov stadium because of unavailability of pitch at the Petrovsky Stadium, the current Zenit ground. Part of the seats were already uninstalled because of planned deconstruction, so the match was visited by only 45,000 spectators despite the sold-out stadium.

The last official match at Kirov stadium was FC Petrotrest - Spartak Shelkovo on 17 August 2006. Visitors won 3-0.

The stadium was demolished in September 2006.  A new stadium, the Krestovsky Stadium, was built on the site and opened in 2017.

He was leader of the Country Party in Western Australia from 1962 to 1973.

Nalder was born in Katanning, Western Australia. A farmer, he was elected to Legislative Assembly at the 1947 state election, winning the seat of Wagin. He switched to the seat of Katanning at the 1950 election. Having served as the party's deputy leader since 1956, Nalder replaced Arthur Watts as leader of the Country Party in 1962. He maintained the existing coalition with the Liberal Party (led by David Brand), with the Brand government eventually being defeated at the 1971 election. Nalder retired from parliament in 1974 and was knighted later that year.

Early life
Nalder was born in Katanning, a small town in Western Australia's Great Southern region, to Janet (née Painter) and Henry Arthur Nalder. He received his early education from state schools in Colanilling, Ballaying, and Bonnie Doon, but boarded at Wesley College, Perth, for his final two years of schooling. After graduating in 1925, Nalder returned to the country, farming at Wagin. From 1932, he served as a lay preacher in the Methodist Church. In October 1936, whilst travelling on the Perth–Wagin Road with two of his brothers, he received a severe concussion after their truck overturned. During World War II, Nalder enlisted in the Australian Army, serving as a private in the 10th Battalion Volunteer Defence Corps.

Politics
A long-time member of the Country Party, Nalder stood for the Legislative Assembly seat of Wagin in the 1947 state elections, and was elected over two other Country Party candidates and one Labor Party candidate. The electoral district of Wagin was abolished in a redistribution prior to the 1950 state elections, and Nalder successfully contested Katanning, which had been vacated following the decision of Arthur Watts, the leader of the party, to move to Stirling. He would hold Katanning until his retirement in 1974, on occasion being re-elected unopposed.

Following Labor's defeat in the 1959 state elections, Nalder was named Minister for Agriculture in the Brand–Watts Ministry, a position he held from 2 April 1959 through to 3 March 1971. From 12 April 1962, he was also Minister for Electricity. Nalder had been elected deputy leader of the Country Party in 1956, replacing Lindsay Thorn, and on Watts' retirement in February 1962, succeeded him as the party's leader (and deputy premier to David Brand). He remained a member of cabinet in the reconstituted Brand–Nalder Ministry until the defeat of the Liberal–Country coalition at the 1971 election, and continued in parliament until the 1974 election.

Later life
On 15 June 1974, following his retirement, Nalder was created a Knight Bachelor. He eventually retired to Bentley (a suburb of Perth), dying there in December 1994 (aged 84). Nalder's son, Cambell Nalder, served as member for Narrogin from 1986 until his death the following year, and a grandson, Dean Nalder, was elected as the Liberal Party member for Alfred Cove, and later member for Bateman. A granddaughter, Karen Middleton, is the chief political correspondent for The Saturday Paper covering federal politics in the Canberra Press Gallery.

Snelling is a young-Earth creationist geologist who works for Answers in Genesis.

Education and career
Snelling has a Ph.D. in geology from the University of Sydney from 1982.

He was, for a decade, the geology spokesman for the Creation Science Foundation, the coordinating center for creationism in Australia.  He started working for Answers in Genesis in 2007 and serves as AiG's director of research.
 
Snelling has been published in standard geological publications estimating the age of geological specimens in billions of years, but has also written articles for creationist journals in which he supports a young-earth creationism viewpoint. He worked in the RATE project.

Snelling appeared in the 2017 creationist documentary film Is Genesis History?

Discrimination allegation lawsuit
Snelling, like other young-Earth creationists, believes the Grand Canyon formed after the Biblical flood;  the rocks in Grand Canyon were formed billions of years ago and the Grand Canyon itself was formed millions of years ago.  In 2013 Snelling applied for a permit to collect 50-60 half-pound rocks from the park. The application was denied because the National Park Service screens applications to take material from the Grand Canyon, to protect it.  One of the three geologists who reviewed the proposal for the National Park Service stated that the type of rock Snelling was trying to test could be found outside the park, and all three reviewers made it clear they did not consider the proposal scientifically valid.

Snelling submitted a revised proposal in 2016.  In a letter dated May 5, 2017, the NPS said it found the application acceptable and it was willing to grant it if changes were made to locations and methods of collecting rocks; Snelling proposed to chisel away rocks and to do so from highly visible rock faces, to take samples from land that was not parkland but rather was on an Indian reservation and also from another location that was likely to have archeological remains.  The NPS had authorized a river trip for Snelling to survey locations but not to collect specimens; Snelling objected that this would take too much time and expense, and in response in the May 5 letter, the NPS offered to have staff work with Snelling to map locations in a meeting or conference call.

On May 9, 2017, Snelling, with the help of the Alliance Defending Freedom, filed a religious discrimination lawsuit against the United States Department of the Interior and the Grand Canyon National Park authorities, citing the Trump administration's executive order of May 4, 2017 about religious liberty. In late June 2017 Answers in Genesis released a statement saying the National Park authorities had issued Snelling a permit to collect rock samples, and that Snelling had withdrawn the lawsuit. Snelling's attorneys did not provide a copy of the permit to a reporter from the Phoenix New Times who requested it.

League business

League changes
After serving as league commissioner for 16 seasons, Brian McKenna, stepped down from the position following the 2017–18 season. He was replaced by Ryan Crelin, who had most recently been serving as the ECHL's chief operating officer.

Team changes 
The Colorado Eagles ownership left the ECHL, bought an expansion franchise and joined the American Hockey League as the affiliate of the Colorado Avalanche to bring the AHL up to 31 teams to match the size of the National Hockey League to continue the one-to-one NHL/AHL affiliations.
The Maine Mariners in Portland, Maine, were added after purchasing the franchise from the folded Alaska Aces. The Mariners were the fifth team to replace a recently relocated American Hockey League (AHL) team, in this case the Portland Pirates, since 2015.
The Newfoundland Growlers in St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador, were added, replacing the recently relocated St. John's IceCaps and becoming the sixth ECHL team to replace an AHL team since 2015.
The Quad City Mallards ceased operations after the 2017–18 season. The Mallards were the first of the teams added in the 2014 merger with the Central Hockey League to cease operations.

Conference realignment 
As the new ECHL teams in Portland, Maine, and St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador, were added to the North Division of the Eastern Conference, the Wheeling Nailers were moved to the Western Conference and Central Division. With the Colorado Eagles joining the American Hockey League, the Kansas City Mavericks moved back to the Mountain Division from the Central.

Affiliation changes

Annual Board of Governors meeting
The annual ECHL Board of Governors meeting was held at the New York-New York Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada, from June 18 to 22, 2018.

All-star game
The 2019 CCM/ECHL All-Star Classic was held on January 21, 2019, at the Huntington Center in Toledo, Ohio. The All-Star Classic retained the four team, 3-on-3 player tournament style used the previous season, but featured two teams made from the Toledo Walleye (named Team Hooks and Team Fins) and one team for each conference's All-Star players. In the round-robin, the Western Conference and Team Fins each went 2–1, while the Eastern Conference and Team Hooks went 1–2. In the semifinal round, the Eastern Conference defeated the Western Conference 4–3 and Team Fins defeated the Team Hooks 3–1. The Eastern Conference All-Star team then defeated Team Fins 2–1 following a shootout. The Brampton Beast's David Pacan was named the tournament's Most Valuable Player.

The skills competition took place in between rounds of the tournament. The Toledo Walleye's Bryan Moore won the fastest skater event, the Walleye's A.J. Jenks won the hardest shot event, and the Brampton Beast's David Pacan won the accuracy shooting event.

Beginning in 1835, he worked as gardener with at Muséum National d'Histoire Naturelle in Paris. From 1849 to 1856, he served as a ""jardinier colonial"" in Tahiti, then as a government botanist in New Caledonia, based in Nouméa (1857–1869). After spending several years in France, he returned to the South Pacific in 1874 as a plant collector in the employ of Belgian horticulturist Jean Jules Linden. In 1877, he died in New Caledonia in an area between La Foa and Moindou.

Many of the plants that he collected from the Pacific were further examined by other botanists that included Adolphe-Théodore Brongniart and Jean Antoine Arthur Gris. The genus Pancheria (family Cunoniaceae) is named after him, as are taxa with the specific epithet of pancheri, an example being  Acmopyle pancheri.

It trained candidates for ordination in the Church of England in Australia.

Origins
The second Bishop of Perth was Henry Hutton Parry, from 1876 to 1893. Parry wished to establish a theological college. At some point between his installation in Perth in 1876 and 1881, he opened his home to four theological students, whom he instructed, with a view to ordination. These efforts appear to have petered out.

Establishment
Parry's successor as Bishop of Perth (first Archbishop from 1914) was Charles Owen Leaver Riley (1894-1929). A priest in the diocese, Charles Lefroy, was instrumental in persuading Riley of the need for a theological college. In 1898 the Perth diocesan synod resolved to establish a theological college, and the Clergy Training College was opened the following year with Lefroy as Principal and with two students.

The college took up occupation of part of The Cloisters, and in 1909 changed its name to St John's Theological College.

Closure
At the outbreak of war in 1914, the college closed, as all of the students enlisted. At that point The Cloisters was converted into a hostel for undergraduates of the University of Western Australia. In 1919 a new college council was formed, and a new Principal appointed in 1920. At that point the college moved to Beaufort Street in Highgate. In 1922 there was a concerted effort for fundraising, but by 1926 there were no students at St John's, and a decision was taken to close. The intention was that it be replaced by St George's College, along the lines of Trinity College, Melbourne and Trinity College Theological School: a residential college within a university but which also offered theological education for ordinands. Although St George's was opened, and remains a residential college of UWA, it never offered theological education.

Wollaston College

Training for ordination recommenced in Perth in 1957, with the establishment of Wollaston College.

His birthplace in Ireland is indeterminate, as various locations such as Ballinoulart, Castleannesley or in Kilnew, County Wexford are documented possibilities. He was ordained a priest in 1785 at Wexford after completing hedge school in Oulart. His first parish was at Ballycanew, after Theology and Philosophy studies at the Irish College in Bordeaux in France.

It is situated on Marygate, by St Mary's Abbey.

History
St Olave's Church is situated within St Mary's Abbey walls, which was ruined in the Dissolution of the Monasteries. It is dedicated to St Olaf, patron saint of Norway. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle entry for 1055 records that ‘This year died Earl Siward at York; and his body lies in the minster at Galmanho, which he had himself ordered to be built and consecrated, in the name of God and St. Olave, to the honour of God and to all his saints.’

Galmanho is a  former name for the area where the church stands and Siward, Earl of Northumbria, is believed to have had his York residence. This is the earliest date for a church dedication to St Olaf (Olav in Norwegian) anywhere.

St Olave's Church was extensively rebuilt in the 15th century. Substantial repairs were carried out in the 1720s including the insertion of windows in the north aisle, the wall of which had earlier served as part of the abbey and later city defences. The church was restored in 1848 - 1849, and reopened on Wednesday 14 February 1849.

The church was again renovated starting in 1887. After a closure of 5 weeks, the church reopened on 2 September 1888. The ceiling of lath and plaster which covered the central aisle of the nave was removed. The pillars, arches and north and west walls were stripped of paint and plaster. A new chancel was added in 1887-9 by George Fowler Jones, a York architect, and later extended in 1906. This contains the five-light 15th-century east window. Despite these changes the architectural style is broadly 15th century.

Current parish life
St Olave's has a strong musical tradition, with a large choir and recently restored organ, as well as a ring of six bells hung for change ringing. In addition the orchestra of the Academy of St Olave's performs three concerts each year and plays for one orchestral Mass on Remembrance Sunday. The Sunday sung eucharist is at 10.30 using Common Worship (order one, contemporary language).

Incumbents
Initially referred to as Chaplains, the post was Curate from 1499, and Vicar from 1663.

McLaren was the Plaintiff in McLaren v Caldwell, that resulted in the landmark decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council that upheld provincial jurisdiction in matters of a local or private nature, as well as over property and civil rights.

Early life 
McLaren was on September 21, 1833, in Lanark, Upper Canada, he was the son of James McLaren, an immigrant from Scotland. He married Sophia, the daughter of Conservative politician William Lees and granddaughter of Andrew W. Playfair.

Business life 
McLaren was involved in the timber trade and operated sawmills in Carleton Place and at McLaren's depot on the Kingston and Pembroke Railway line as well as in Alberta.

Rivers and Streams Act 
In 1881, the 4th Ontario parliament passed the Rivers and Streams Act, mainly due to a dispute between McLaren and a rival lumber company over access to McLaren's timber slides on the Mississippi River. The enactment gave the right to individuals to flow logs down rivers, creeks, and streams, and allowed those who made improvements along a river to receive a toll set by the lieutenant governor from others floating logs down a river. The Ontario law was disallowed by the John A. Macdonald government. The report on disallowance cited removal property rights from individuals down river who would be forced to become ""toll-keeper against his will"", which amounted to taking away the ""rights of one man and vest them in another"" which a legislatures power to do so was deemed ""exceedingly doubtful"". The decision to disallow the Act went against the principles of disallowance Macdonald previously authored in 1868, and was protested by the Premier of Ontario Oliver Mowat and opposition in Parliament, including Wilfrid Laurier. Further accusations came from the opposition claiming the decision was motivated, as McLaren who petitioned for disallowance was a known political friend of Macdonald. Macdonald's conservative government was unsuccessful at arguing that this disallowance aligned with previous decisions, and conservative Dalton McCarthy conceded in parliament that the disallowance was based on a new principle. Macdonald defended the decision on the concept of protecting property rights and it was within the general interest of the Dominion to maintain those rights to ensure continued certainty in investment. Gérard La Forest believed the report authorizing the disallowance was not authored by justice minister James McDonald was actually written by John A. Macdonald, as McDonald would cease his role as justice minister only a few days after its publication.

The Ontario legislature protested the disallowance and passed the same Act three more times, all of which were disallowed, and finally a fourth attempt in 1884 which was not disallowed and continued as law. The issue was settled in the landmark case McLaren v Caldwell by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council which upheld the enactment.

Political life 
McLaren was appointed to the Senate of Canada in 1890 on the advice of John Alexander Macdonald representing the senatorial division of Perth, Ontario. A Conservative, he served 29 years until his death in 1919.

Death 

McLaren died in Perth on May 23, 1919. His estate was valued at $15 million.

The magazine, which primarily published English-language translations of seinen manga, was the first English-language magazine that published manga aimed at an adult readership.

History 
During the anime boom of the 1990s, the initial wave of manga and anime titles localized for English-language audiences were aimed at children, such as Sailor Moon and Pokémon. Upon launching in 1997, Pulp became the first English-language manga magazine to publish manga aimed at an adult audience, and emerged as one of several magazines (along with Raijin Comics, Animerica Extra, and others) to publish manga titles aimed at demographics outside of children's manga.

Pulp published editorial features, media reviews, and longform articles in addition to manga. The magazine expanded in February 2000 to incorporate a wider range of content on Japanese culture, such as photography from Nobuyoshi Araki, reviews by Heinz Insu Fenkl, and ""Vulgarity Drifting Diary"", a column by sex worker Hikaru Natsumi, nearly doubling the size of the print edition in the process. Pulp also published Pulp Books, a line of non-fiction books created in partnership with Cadence Books.

Sales for Pulp were consistently low. In May 2002, Viz announced that Pulp would cease publication with its August 2002 issue, published in July of that year. The final issue of the magazine focused on contributor interpretations of the theme of ""Manga Hell"", including the erotic comics of Osamu Tezuka and the horror comics of Kazuo Koike. The magazine's unfinished serialization of Banana Fish continued in Animerica Extra (which itself would fold in 2004), while other titles were published directly as graphic novels by Viz under their Editor's Choice imprint.

Titles serialized in Pulp were also published as collected editions by Viz under a Pulp-branded literary imprint with its own unique trade dress.

Reception and legacy 
Pulp has been noted as being ""instrumental in disseminating manga culture"" in North America. The magazine was regarded positively by critics and commentators, with Warren Ellis calling the magazine ""amongst the best things currently being published in the English language"" and Wizard describing the magazine as ""some of the coolest, most subversive manga being translated into English today."" Reflecting on the magazine's commercial failure, Viz editor Shaenon K. Garrity described Pulp as publishing ""manga most people just weren't ready for, stuff that was too smart, sexy, bloody, creepy, surreal, or just plain untranslatable for prime time.""

In 2010 Viz launched the literary imprint Viz Signature and the digital distribution platform SigIKKI (an online English version of Monthly Ikki), both of which publish manga aimed at adult audiences. Pulp was noted by Viz as a forerunner to both platforms, with Viz editorial manager Leyla Aker stating that SigIKKI was jokingly referred to as ""Pulp 2.0"" in internal planning discussions.

A turbocharged variant of the Neon, the car was developed by DaimlerChrysler's in house PVO (Performance Vehicle Operations) tuner group. PVO was officially renamed SRT (Street and Racing Technology) in 2004. The ""4"" in the SRT-4's name denotes the number of cylinders of the engine. ACR (American Club Racing) and Commemorative Edition models were later introduced as well.

History

In 1998, Tom Gale, (then Executive Vice President of Chrysler Product Development and Design), attended the 1998 Specialty Equipment Market Association (SEMA) Show in Las Vegas. Gale noted a list of performance features he saw on the sport compact cars at the show, and wanted to integrate those features into Chrysler's compact production car, the Dodge Neon. Gale was the design chief of the original Dodge Viper concept vehicle, and recognized an opportunity to build a sport compact that would appeal to the younger auto generation who grew up on tuner cars, who may prefer a new car with the same performance appeal right off the showroom floor.

A group of young Dodge and Chrysler talent was assembled to put together a vehicle to meet Gale's request, with all of the team members sharing first-hand knowledge and familiarity of the existing Dodge Neon. They created a concept car, the 2000 Neon SRT, in just 4 months, with a 2.0 L 16-valve four-cylinder topped with a 45-cubic-inch Eaton supercharger, which produced  and  of torque at the flywheel on  of boost. (Sport Compact Car magazine tested the car in the Feb. 2001 issue and dynoed  and  torque at the wheels.)

The group put more than 1000 miles on the test track with the vehicle in under two weeks. In November 1999, the car was shown at the SEMA show with a glowing response. The vehicle was then shown at the Los Angeles Auto Show in January 2000, center stage on a turntable. The team continued to work on the car, to try to bring it to the level of production vehicle, creating a second car using more production-oriented parts in an effort to lower the costs necessary to justify production. They even parked the second car in Gale's parking spot in order to get it noticed. Regardless, in fall of 2000, the executive committee rejected the production car proposal. The team put together a list of reasons why the car was not approved, and worked through the list item by item to find solutions to every issue presented. After three more versions of the car, the company's Specialty Vehicle Engineering (SVE) team took over the project. The executive committee once again considered the vehicle in the spring of 2001, and this time gave the go ahead for the project.

In January 2002, SVE became known as Performance Vehicle Operations (PVO). The PVO group was responsible for developing the concept car into a production car. A turbocharged 2.4 liter inline-4 gasoline engine (A853 engine) was used. This engine was nearly identical to the 2003 Chrysler PT Cruiser (A855 engine), except the SRT-4 did not have the unique intake manifold required to fit the engine into the PT Cruiser engine bay. The car was then given a New Venture Gear T-850 five-speed manual transmission (based on the unit from the European turbodiesel minivans), equal-length half shafts, and a high capacity Sachs performance clutch. The suspension had stiffer springs, SRT-tuned Tokico struts (with travel reduced to provide clearance for the larger wheels), and larger front and rear sway bars were added. A unique steering gear, PT Cruiser steering knuckles, and an updated K member were also incorporated. Front brakes used 11.0 in (280 mm) vented disc brakes with extra thick rotors to prevent warping, and 10.6 in (270 mm) non-vented disc brakes in the rear, with single piston calipers (57mm front, 36mm rear).

17 x 6 inch cast aluminum wheels were used, with an offset of 43mm, along with 205/50/17 Michelin Pilot Sport performance tires. The wheels were designed with a unique spoke pattern to allow for improved airflow to the brakes, and were similar to that of the TSW VX1 wheels used on the original 2000 Neon SRT. Unique side skirts, rear fascia, and a large rear wing (spoiler) were used to upgrade the exterior look of the vehicle. The cooling ducts (front nostrils) were added to the pre-production car in late 2002 on the front fascia to help reduce temperatures in the engine bay of the vehicle.

On the interior, the standard agate-colored front seats were modeled after the Dodge Viper SRT-10 seats, and featured enhanced lumbar and lateral side bolsters to stabilize occupants during performance driving. In 2004, base Neon side airbag seats were added as an option. A faux carbon fiber steering wheel and shift boot were used, along with a satin silver “cue ball” type shift knob and silver aluminum floor pedals. Unique gauge designs in the SRT-4 (which were exclusive to the SRT lineup) featured special silver faces with satin silver ring accents, and the SRT-4 logo on the facing. The same satin metal trim was also featured on the instrument panel center stack, climate control knobs and on the door handles. A silver (white in early 2003 models) Auto-Meter brand turbo boost/vacuum gauge was set to the right of the instrument cluster. Like all other Neon models, the SRT-4 had power front windows, and manual rear windows, a costs saving feature. Overall, the vehicle's entire powertrain (engine and transmission), suspension, braking system, exhaust, wheels, and tires were upgraded from that of the base model Neon, along with the interior upgrades. The production model was produced in Belvidere, Illinois, with 84% US content.

In 2003, the Dodge Neon SRT-4 went on sale to the public. At the time, the car was the second fastest stock production vehicle in the Chrysler/Dodge lineup, second only to the Viper. In 2004, PVO changed their name to Street & Racing Technology (SRT), Chrysler's high-performance automotive group. The 2004 model was updated with more power and torque, and included a torque-sensing Quaife limited-slip differential, larger fuel injectors, new engine management software, BF Goodrich g-Force T/A KDW-2 three season ultra-high-performance tires, and paint/trim changes. Dodge removed the “Neon” designation from the vehicle in 2004, marketing the car simply as the “SRT-4”. In 2005, an American Club Racer (ACR) package and limited edition numbered Commemorative version of the SRT-4 were also offered.

Initially, Dodge expected to sell a conservative number of only 2,500 units per year. However, during the three year production run (2003 through 2005), more than 25,000 Neon SRT-4s were produced. With the discontinuation of the PL platform after model year 2005, the SRT-4 ceased production. In 2008 Dodge introduced the Caliber SRT-4 as a replacement.

Performance

Engine details
The SRT-4 used the same basic engine block as the naturally aspirated 2003+ 2.4L, and was different from the years previous used in the naturally aspirated Chrysler 2.4L mid-size cars such as the PT Cruiser and four-door Stratus. The SRT4 engine had many improvements, including: stronger crank case webbing, a thicker deck with 11 mm head bolts (vs 10 mm), an oil drain back for the turbo, a cast aluminum structural oil pan, a higher capacity oil pump, a crankshaft of higher hardness steel, improved machining of bearing journals, oil squirters (to cool underside of pistons), eutectic aluminum alloy pistons made specially by Mahle, and forged connecting rods with cracked caps and 9 mm bolts. The cylinder head was also different for turbo engines, from naturally aspirated. The turbo version (PT Cruiser GT Turbo and SRT-4) included: larger diameter valves and seats, exhaust valves made of Inconel, improved cooling and larger oil drain back passages, different camshafts. The PT Cruiser Turbo engine package differs from the SRT-4 because the intake manifold, turbocharger plumbing and intercooler are different. The SRT-4 intercooler was a front-mounted cast aluminum 8-row unit produced by Valeo, unique in its efficiency and computer designed end tanks for air flow.

The turbocharger was a reverse rotation Mitsubishi TD04LR-15Gk with a  turbine inlet. Tight packaging forced some creative thinking on the turbocharger. The TD04 compressor has a compressor bypass valve built right into the compressor housing. The exhaust manifold and turbine housing were cast in one piece by Mitsubishi from high-nickel Ni-Resist steel. The one-piece design improved flow, reduced size and reduced thermal mass for quicker cat light-off. The turbine discharge was also part of the manifold/turbine housing casting, and it looped back around and hit the manifold again on its way to the catalytic converter. Where they met, there was a wastegate valve; keeping the wastegate valve away from the turbine housing improved flow where it mattered most. Maximum boost in stock form was around . Piston velocities and valve-train components force a rev limit of 6240 rpm although MOPAR upped the ante with their Stage 2 and 3 kits which have a rev limit of 6500 rpm.

The exhaust system for the vehicle consists of  steel tubing, which is run first through the catalytic converter, then through two resonators. The exhaust then splits into two separate sections of piping, exiting through two  stainless steel tips at the rear of the vehicle. The exhaust system is unique in that there is no muffler, instead relying on the turbocharger and resonators to reduce the exhaust volume. The end result is a very distinctive and audible exhaust note.

2005 Commemorative Edition

In 2005, Dodge released an SRT-4 Commemorative Edition. This model (along with the Commemorative Edition versions of the Viper SRT-10 and Ram SRT-10) was created to celebrate the SRT vehicles.

This limited, numbered version included:

""Electric Blue"" painted ""Viper"" stripes over the ""Stone White"" colored body.
Blue stitching on the floor mats, shift boots, seats, and steering wheel.
Stainless steel ""SRT-4"" door sill plates.
A total of 200 Commemorative Edition SRT-4's were built.
A ""XXX/200"" numbered metal plaque, inset just ahead of the cup holders.
A Commemorative Edition booklet (same booklet included with the Commemorative Vipers and Ram SRT-10's).
No performance extras were added on the Commemorative Edition.

2003 SRT-4 Extreme LightWeight
In 2003, Dodge engineers built a special SRT-4 Extreme LightWeight for the 2003 SEMA show. It was designed to showcase the factory upgrade parts available for the SRT-4 from Mopar. The vehicle featured lightweight, carbon fiber body pieces (produced in-house), a polycarbonate rear window, and the front window glass removed for weight reduction. The interior was stripped completely, with only the stock dash remaining. A single Recaro racing seat, a harness, and a roll cage were installed for safety. The car featured the first stage 3R Mopar engine performance kit and stage 3R coilovers. Overall, the weight of the vehicle was reduced by  to  wet, and was dyno'd at 360 hp (270 kW) and 383 lb•ft (519 N•m) (at the wheels) by Sport Compact Car magazine. On drag slicks, it ran an 11.83-second pass at 123 mph (198 km/h) in 70 °F (21 °C) weather. This one-off SRT-4 was used for media events and testing of the Mopar development parts, and was destroyed as an asset reduction move in 2009.

Racing
In 2003, Cory O'Brien and Erich Heuschele drove an SRT-4 to a 1st in class and 8th overall finish in the Tire Rack Cannonball One Lap of America.

In SCCA ProRally racing, the SRT-4 (and more recently the ACR version) has dominated the Group 5 (2WD) class since 2003. In just its first year competing, the Dodge ended the stranglehold that the FWD DSMs and Volkswagens had on the class. With three competing the following year, the SRT-4 won every 2004 series race and end-of-season award. The SRT-4 has won every Group 5 and 2-Wheel-Drive class championship in US ProRally and Sno Drift since 2003, and its unprecedented dominance in 2004 helped Dodge earn its first US ProRally Manufacturers Championship in 28 years.

In 2005, Jeff Lepper drove the SRT-4 to its first ever national road racing win in the NASA US Touring Car Championship at California Speedway in Fontana.

In 2005, Dale Seeley, Kolin Aspergren, and Jamin Cummings drove an SRT-4 to a 1st in class and 8th overall finish in the Tire Rack Cannonball One Lap of America.

In 2006, the Dodge SRT-4 officially became the world's fastest production 4-cylinder car, averaging  at the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah in a car driven by Jorgen Moller. The vehicle was tuned by Dave Harris and Phil Hurst for Racedeck Racing.

Multiple SRT-4s were raced in the SCCA SPEED World Challenge – Touring Car Series, and in 2006 – their second year of competition – had become one of the more successful platforms in the series. Robb Holland, of 3R Racing, became the first Pro driver to put the SRT-4 on the podium with his 3rd-place finish at Road America in August 2006. This was Dodge's first podium and first manufacturer's points in World Challenge Touring Car competition. Holland would finish the season with 3 top 10 finishes and two top 5 qualifying efforts in the SRT-4.

In 2007, Doug Wind, Devin Clancy, and Ken Brewer drove an SRT-4 to a 1st in class and 5th overall finish in the Tire Rack Cannonball One Lap of America.

In 2007, George Biskup drove an SRT-4 Neon to several SCCA T-2 National wins, and set the Track Qualifying Record at Road America.  His lap time of 2:33.922 remained the record for several years.  Earlier in 2005, Biskup won the first SCCA National race he entered at Gingerman Raceway.  Due to snowy conditions, the race was run under yellow and finishing positions were as qualified, Biskup's SRT-4 was on the pole with the fastest qualifying time.

In 2007, Curt Simmons won the U.S. Touring Car Championship in an SRT-4 and Dodge won the season manufacturers points championship by 29 points over Honda behind the strength of several SRT-4's.

In 2007, Stan Wilson won the Speed World Challenge Touring Car Rookie Driver of the Year and the Sunoco Hard Charger of the Year awards driving the Sorted Performance Dodge SRT-4. This was Dodge's first title in Speed World Challenge Touring Car.

In 2008, Curt Simmons attempts to defend his USTCC series championship, winning on June 29, 2008 at Infineon Raceway in Sonoma, CA.

In 2012, Russ Deane set a new world land speed record for four-cylinder production cars (SRT-4) of more than . He surpassed the previous record of 224 mph for a Class F/PS vehicle. Deane and his Hinckley Automotive race team were participating in Speed Week at the Bonneville Salt Flats. His race team included Jim Hinckley, Dave Harris (chief), Craig Ohlson, ""Camel"" Joe George, Troy Cheney, Stuart Gosswein, and Jim Hinckley Jr.

In this branch the characters are military, with the characters from the Gundam series split into air, land and sea troops and redesigned accordingly. Was released as model kits mostly in the Ganso line.

Similar to other SD Gundam series, Command Chronicles is set on a singular planet and serves as a stand in for a real world nation. Whilst Musha Gundam commonly represents Asia (Japan, China, India, etc.) and Knight Gundam represents Europe, Command represents America. This is highlighted by the fact the characters use random Engrish and are based on the 'trigger happy' depiction of Americans seen within many action films of the 1980s/1990s, such as Rambo. This behaviour is often highlighted to extremes for comedic purposes. In one mini-comic, after a mission to stop a nuclear launch goes wrong the Gundams are shown having to leave their now destroyed country behind and live in outer space.

Together Musha Gundam, Knight Gundam and Command Chronicles later became the fundamental setting of SD Gundam Force.

Outline 
The designs started out as SD Gundam original characters but as the characters increase a world is set up for them. Soon after a crossover of the Musha Gundam and Knight Gundam worlds was decided and the SD Command Chronicles world is set up as the distant future of the Musha and Knight worlds (Gunsavior Z from SD Command Chronicles G-ARMS went back to Ark of the ""past"" and became Gunsaber.

They are considered a type of onibi. In the Miyazaki Prefecture they are also called musabi (むさ火) and in the Kōchi Prefecture, they are also called kechibi.

Outline
Their name comes from the ""janjan"" sound that they make. Also in Nara, there are different legends depending on the area, and different alternate names depending on the area.

Byakugō-ji town, Nara city
It indicates two balls of fire that appear in the graveyard of Byakugō-ji and Daian-ji. In the Fūfu River, the two balls of fire would meet together, intertwine themselves, and then finally return to their graves.
When a person sees this fire, it would come closer to that person, and even when those who are chased by the janjanbi flee into the middle of a pond, the fire would still follow them above the pond.
They are said in the legends to be a man and a woman who committed double suicide, and since they were buried in separate temples after death, they became balls of fire that meet together.
Yamatokōriyama
It indicates two hitodama that would visit every year on June 7th on the bridge above the Saho River. Just like the ones from Byakugō-ji town, they are also the spirits of a man and a woman.
It was said that there was previously a custom when it was June 7th for 20 men and women to be selected from each of the surrounding villages and dance above the bridge where they appear frequently, in order to console the spirit of the hitodama.
Fujichō, Tenri
It indicates a ball of fire that would appear from the remains of a castle and fly westwards. For those who encounter this, it would be necessary for them to hide under a bridge and wait for it to pass. It is also called Zannenbi (残念火, lit. ""disappointment fire"").

Yanagimotochō and Tainoshōchō, Tenri, and Kashihara
On a summer night when rain is near, by turning towards the Tōichi castle and saying, ""Hoi hoi,"" it would come flying, make the sound ""jan jan"" and then disappear. It is also called the hoihoibi (ホイホイ火).
It is considered to be the onryō of the military commander Tōtada Tōichi who was slain by Matsunaga Danjō in the Azuchi–Momoyama period, and those who see it would, by the onryō's curse, become sick with fever for three days and nights. When Tōtada was slain, the killed soldiers all said ""zannen, zannen (disappointment, disappointment)"" as a crowd of voices, which is why it was heard as ""jan jan.""
Also, in Tainoshōchō, Tenri, there is a jizō with its head separated called the ""kubikiri jizō (decapitated jizō),"" but it is said that a soldier who was being attacked by the janjanbi in the past swung his sword around and mistakenly cut off the head of a jizō by the roadside. It was said that in the end, that soldier died completely burning.

460,['The road between CR 424ed ( formerly SR 424 ) and US 24 have been designated as a part of US 24 during the time the Defiance bypass was complete but the Napoleon portion was still under construction .'],"State Route 281 (SR 281) is an east–west state highway in the northwestern portion of the U.S. state of Ohio.  Its western terminus is at U.S. Route 24 approximately  northeast of downtown Defiance, and its eastern terminus is at US 6 nearly  north of Bradner.  The majority of the route is known as the Defiance Pike.

Route description

The state route begins at a diamond interchange with the US 24 freeway (exit 28). The interchange is partially within the city limits of Defiance and partially in Richland Township. Defiance County Route 175 heads north from the interchange while SR 281 heads south along Domersville Road often crossing between Defiance and Richland Township. After a traffic signal at a connector road to Defiance County Route 424, the route crosses the Maumee River on a plate girder bridge. A short distance later, SR 281 intersects SR 18 and the two routes form a concurrency and head east out of the city past a General Motors factory. After , the SR 18 concurrency ends and SR 281 continues due east. Outside of the Defiance area, the route's surroundings becomes much more agricultural. After exiting Defiance County, it enters Henry County. SR 281 does not pass through any incorporated villages through Henry County, but it intersects State Routes 108, 109, and 65. After crossing into Wood County, SR 281 enters the small village of Custar. SR 281 continues east intersecting SR 235 and SR 25 but also passes over Interstate 75 without an interchange. After its intersection with SR 199, SR 281 turns to the northeast and enters the village of Wayne. Through Wayne, the route has the road names of Main Street and Church Street.  northeast of Wayne, SR 281 then passes through the village of Bradner first on Church Street, then due north on Main Street. SR 281 ends at as stop-controlled intersection with US 6 about  north of Bradner. The road continues north as the Freedom Township-maintained Bradner Road.

History
SR 281 was first designated on its current alignment in 1930, but only on the  segment between SR 109 and SR 65 in Henry County. In 1934, the route was extended east into Wood County to end at then-US 25 and US 68 in Wood County (modern-day SR 25) and within one year, was extended west to SR 18 near Defiance. The route was extended further east to its current eastern terminus in 1939 when SR 281 was routed over county roads and SR 297 from Wayne through Bradner to US 6. The route would remain unchanged for 33 years except for becoming fully asphalt-paved by 1950.

In 1972, SR 281 was extended west on a new bridge over the Maumee River and over existing roads to end at the US 24 bypass of Defiance and Napoleon. The road between CR 424 (formerly SR 424) and US 24 had been designated as a part of US 24 during the time the Defiance bypass was complete but the Napoleon portion was still under construction. The at-grade intersection with US 24 was replaced by a diamond interchange in 2007 as a part of the widening of US 24 through northwestern Ohio.

Four events took place, all being staged at Lord's Cricket Ground in front of temporary stands built to accommodate up to 6,500 spectators.

South Korea was the most successful nation, topping the medal table with three golds and four medals in total.

Competition format 

A total of 128 athletes competed across the four events: the men's individual, women's individual, men's team, and women's team.

All four events were recurve archery events, held under the FITA-approved 70-metre distance and rules. The competition started with an initial ranking round involving all 64 archers of each gender. Each archer shot a total of 72 arrows to be seeded from 1–64 according to their score.

The ranking round was also used to seed the teams from 1 to 12, by aggregating the individual scores for the members of each team.

Each event was then played in a single-elimination tournament format, except for the semi-final losers, who played-off to decide the bronze medal winner.

Individual events 

In the individual events, all 64 competitors entered the competition at the first round, the round of 64. The draw was seeded according to the result of the ranking round so the first seed shot against the 64th seed in the first round.

Each match was the best-of-five sets, with three arrows per set. The winner of each set received two points, and if the scores in the set were tied then each archer received one point. If at the end of five sets the score was tied at 5–5, a single arrow shoot-off would be held and the closest to the centre would be declared the winner.

Team events 
In the team events, the top four seeded teams from the ranking round received a bye to the quarter-final. The remaining eight teams, seeded 5th to 12th, competed for the remaining four places in the quarter-finals.

Each match consisted of 24 arrows from each team (eight from each team member) and the team with the highest score progressed. In the event of scores being tied, a three-arrow shoot-off would take place.

Schedule 
All times are British Summer Time (UTC+01:00).

Qualification 

Each National Olympic Committee (NOC) was permitted to enter a maximum of six competitors, three per gender. NOCs that qualified teams for a particular gender were able to send a three-member team to the team event and also have each member compete in the individual event. There were 12 team spots for each gender, thus qualifying 36 individuals through team qualification. All other NOCs may earn a maximum of one quota place per gender for the individual events.

Six places were reserved for Great Britain as the host nation, and a further six were decided by the Tripartite Commission. The remaining 116 places were then allocated through a qualification process, in which archers earned quota places for their respective NOCs, though not necessarily for themselves.

To be eligible to participate in the Olympic Games after the NOC has obtained a quota place, all archers must have achieved the following minimum qualification score (MQS):

Men: FITA round of 1230 or 70m round of 625
Women: FITA round of 1230 or 70m round of 600

The MQS must have been achieved between 2 July 2011 (starting at the 2011 World Outdoor Archery Championships) and 1 July 2012 at a registered FITA event.

Design and development
The aircraft was designed as a US FAR 103 Ultralight Vehicles rules two-seat trainer. It features a cable-braced hang glider-style high-wing, weight-shift controls, a two-seats-in-tandem open cockpit, tricycle landing gear and a single engine in pusher configuration.

The aircraft is made from bolted-together aluminum tubing, with its single surface wing covered in Dacron sailcloth. Its  span wing is supported by a single tube-type kingpost and uses an ""A"" frame control bar. Unlike the Spartan DFS Trike the Aerotome uses only a trike delta wing and cannot be converted for powered parachute use.

The standard engine supplied was the twin cylinder, two-stroke, air-cooled  Rotax 503, with a  fuel tank. When in production it came with optional dual controls, aero-towing hardware, larger engines and  fuel tank. Thirty had been completed and flown by February 2000.

It is currently used mostly for football matches. It is the home ground of Uberlândia Esporte Clube and Clube Atlético Portal, and is the biggest stadium in Minas Gerais state countryside. The stadium was built in 1982 and is able to hold 53,350 people. It is owned by the Uberlândia City Hall.

History

The stadium was inaugurated on May 27, 1982, as Parque do Sabiá (meaning Thrush's Park).

In 1995, the stadium was renamed to Estádio Municipal João Havelange (João Havelange Municipal Stadium), after a suggestion of the city councilor Leonídio Bouças. However, the name change was not very popular among the city's football fans, and the stadium is still commonly called the Parque do Sabiá.

The inaugural match was played on May 27, 1982, when the Brazil national football team beat the Republic of Ireland national football team 7–0. The first goal of the stadium was scored by Brazil's Falcão.

The stadium's attendance record currently stands at 80,000, set on the inaugural match.

In 2015, the stadium was renamed to Estádio Municipal Parque do Sabiá, due to FIFA scandals.

The law not only tightened enforcement but also made unauthorized immigrants who had arrived before 1982 eligible for amnesty. Ricks became a U.S. citizen in her early 20s.

Career 
Prior to entering politics, Ricks worked as an accountant and operated a mortgage business. In 2017, Ricks unsuccessfully sought a seat on the Aurora City Council, placing third in a field of five candidates. In November 2020, Ricks was elected to the Colorado House of Representatives, defeating Republican nominee Richard Allen Bassett. Ricks is the first Black immigrant elected to Colorado’s Statehouse.

During her campaign, Ricks was advised by New American Leaders and Emerge America, non-profit organizations that recruit and train female candidates for office. Upon her election, Ricks became one of the first two Liberian-American elected to a state legislature in the United States, along with Nathan Biah of Rhode Island.

It possesses anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, hypnotic, sedative and skeletal muscle relaxant properties, and is considered to be similar in effect to other short-acting hypnotic benzodiazepines such as triazolam or midazolam. It is used in the short-term treatment of severe insomnia. Brotizolam is a highly potent and short-acting hypnotic, with a typical dose ranging from 0.125 to 0.25 milligrams, which is rapidly eliminated with an average half-life of 4.4 hours (range 3.6–7.9 hours).

It was patented in 1974 and came into medical use in 1984. Brotizolam is not approved for sale in the UK, United States or Canada. It is approved for sale in the Netherlands, Germany, Spain, Belgium, Luxembourg, Austria, Portugal, Israel, Italy, Taiwan and Japan.

Medical uses
Brotizolam is prescribed for the short-term treatment, 2–4 weeks only of severe or debilitating insomnia. Insomnia can be described as a difficulty falling asleep, frequent awakening, early awakenings or a combination of each. Brotizolam is a short-acting benzodiazepine and is sometimes used in patients who have difficulty in maintaining sleep or getting to sleep. Hypnotics should only be used on a short-term basis or in those with chronic insomnia on an occasional basis.

Brotizolam, in a dose of 0.25 mg can be used as a premedication prior to surgery, this dose was found to be comparable in efficacy to 2 mg flunitrazepam as a premedicant prior to surgery.

Side effects
Common side effects of brotizolam are typical of hypnotic benzodiazepines and are related to CNS depression, and include somnolence, ataxia, headache, anterograde amnesia, dizziness, fatigue, impairment of motor functions, slurred speech, confusion, and clumsiness.

Less common side effects include hypotension, respiratory depression, hallucinations, nausea and vomiting, palpitations, and paradoxical reactions (i.e. aggression, anxiety, violent behavior, etc.).

Brotizolam can cause residual side effects the next day such as impaired cognitive and motor functions as well as drowsiness. Disruption of sleep patterns may also occur such as suppression of REM sleep. These side effects are more likely at higher doses (above 0.5–1 mg).

In clinical trials brotizolam 0.125 to 0.5 mg improved sleep in insomniacs similarly to nitrazepam 2.5 and 5 mg, flunitrazepam 2 mg and triazolam 0.25 mg, whilst brotizolam 0.5 mg was shown to be superior to flurazepam 30 mg, but inferior to temazepam 30 mg in some studies. Brotizolam at dosages below 0.5 mg at night usually produced minimal morning drowsiness; no residual impairment of psychomotor performance occurs following dosages within the recommended range of 0.125 to 0.25 mg. No serious side effects have been reported to date and the most frequently observed adverse experiences are drowsiness, headache and dizziness. Mild rebound insomnia may occur in some patients when treatment is stopped.

Contraindications and special caution
Thienodiazepines and benzodiazepines require special precaution if used in the elderly, during pregnancy, in children, alcohol or drug-dependent individuals and individuals with comorbid psychiatric disorders.

Pharmacology
Brotizolam has been shown in animal studies to be a very high potency thienodiazepine. The elimination half-life of brotizolam is 3–6 hours. It is absorbed rapidly after administration; after administration, it is metabolized into active metabolites, one of which is far less potent than brotizolam and the other is only present in very small amounts in the blood and thus the metabolites of brotizolam do not have significant pharmacological effect in humans. Brotizolam induces impairment of motor function and has hypnotic properties.

Brotizolam increases the slow wave light sleep (SWLS) in a dose-dependent manner whilst suppressing deep sleep stages. Less time is spent in stages 3 and 4, which are the deep sleep stages, when GABAergics such as brotizolam are used. Benzodiazepines and thienodiazepines are therefore not ideal hypnotics in the treatment of insomnia. The suppression of deep sleep stages by either may be especially problematic to the elderly as they naturally spend less time in the deep sleep stage.

Abuse

Brotizolam is a drug with a potential for abuse. Drug misuse is defined as taking the drug to achieve a 'high', or continuing to take the drug in the long term against medical advice.

Abuse of brotizolam, although not widespread, was a problem in Hong Kong back in the late 1980s and 1990s. To control benzodiazepine abuse in Hong Kong, the Government's Pharmacy and Poisons Board reclassified benzodiazepines as Dangerous Drugs in October 1990. Apart from formal prescriptions, detailed records were then required for the supply and dispensing of these drugs. These regulations were applied initially only to brotizolam, triazolam and flunitrazepam as they were the major benzodiazepines of abuse. The impact of these regulatory changes on benzodiazepine use has been studied by analyzing the sales patterns of seven benzodiazepines between 1990–1993. In 1991, the sales of flunitrazepam and triazolam fell, but the sales of five unrestricted benzodiazepines increased. Particular problems arose with the trafficking and abuse of nimetazepam and the abuse of temazepam within that same year in 1991. The regulations that were originally only applied to brotizolam, triazolam and flunitrazepam were now being extended to include all benzodiazepines by January 1992. A regulation requiring the use of proper prescriptions and detailed records for the supply and dispensing of benzodiazepines, appears to have curbed, at least partially, their abuse in Hong Kong. There are still some problems with temazepam, nimetazepam, triazolam, and brotizolam, but they are not major.

The band consists of Ben Thornewill (vocals & piano), Tommy Siegel (vocals & guitar) and Jesse Kristin (drums). The band has been active since 2006.

History
In 2003, Thornewill, Siegel, and Kristin met while attending George Washington University, and formed a band called The Sunday Mail. After two years, they decided to change their name.

After they thought they had enough new material, they renamed themselves Jukebox the Ghost. The name was a combination of words chosen democratically, with ""jukebox"" originating from the lyrics of a Captain Beefheart song and ""ghost"" as a reference to a Nabokov novel. In a 2020 interview, Siegel said that the idea to add the word ""ghost"" to the band name occurred to Thornewill in particular, as ""he really wanted something involving ghosts"".

In 2008, they released their first album, Let Live & Let Ghosts which was recorded during winter break of their senior year of college.

Jukebox the Ghost recorded a cover of Ace of Base's ""Beautiful Life"" for Engine Room Recordings' compilation album Guilt by Association Vol. 2, which was released in November 2008.

After releasing their debut album, they toured with Say Hi and Nightmare of You, among others. In 2009 they toured with Ben Folds, followed shortly by a tour with Jenny Owen Youngs in the United States. The band began recording their sophomore album ""Everything Under the Sun"" on September 29, 2009 at Tarquin Studios in Bridgeport, Connecticut, an indie recording studio that specializes in analog recording.

In February 2010, Jukebox the Ghost toured Europe with Adam Green of The Moldy Peaches. This was followed by more touring in the United States with the bands Tally Hall and Skybox. They took another break and started playing live shows once again in late May 2010 with the band Free Energy, and once headlined as a minor band at Lollapalooza in Chicago.

September 1, 2010, marked a major milestone for the band, as they appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman. Jukebox the Ghost opened for Barenaked Ladies during the fall of 2010 from October through November, and were a featured band on the Barenaked Ladies-hosted Sixthman cruise, Ships & Dip 4, in February 2011. Jukebox The Ghost also was a featured band on another Sixthman Cruise, ""Rombello,"" in September 2011, and toured with Guster soon after. The band opened for Jack's Mannequin and Motion City Soundtrack in 2012.

On June 12, 2012, Jukebox the Ghost released their third album, Safe Travels. The album marked a departure from their often-fictional narratives in favor of more personal lyrics. In an interview with Jukebox the Ghost, Ben Thornewill stated that ""this record has a lot of songs that are directly from our own life experience. Whether they are journalistically accurate or not, probably not, but they come from something in our lives, not something we’re imagining.”

On May 23, 2014, they released a new single, ""The Great Unknown"" from their self-titled fourth record, Jukebox the Ghost which was released on October 21, 2014.

On January 21, 2015, the band announced they had signed with preeminent pop alternative label Cherrytree Records. Cherrytree Records is a subsidiary of Interscope Records. Jukebox the Ghost re-released their self-titled album in February 2015, under their new label. This was quickly followed by the band's performance of ""Postcard"" on Conan's late night show on January 26. As of January 2016, they are no longer affiliated with Cherrytree Records.

In late March 2015, the group announced a national summer tour with Ingrid Michaelson. In early April they released the music video of ""Postcard.""

The band also wrote a song called ""Black Hole"" for The Mr. Peabody & Sherman Show. ""Black Hole"" was featured on an episode in 2015.

That year, the band began their annual ""HalloQueen"" shows, a series of performances around Halloween in which the band wears costumes inspired by and covers songs by Queen. What began as a pair of small shows in 2015 evolved to tours in 2018 and 2019.

On March 6, 2017, after nearly three years on tour leave from recording, the group released the single, ""Stay the Night."" This song was featured in the second season of Rob Schneider's Netflix Series, Real Rob.

While performing in late 2017, the group announced that they had recently finished recording a new album and debuted a new song from that album, ""Boring.""

On January 19, 2018, the group announced the new single ""Everybody's Lonely"" along with a new album titled Off to the Races. The album was released on March 30, 2018. In addition, the group announced a national tour to support the album beginning in Spring 2018.

The single ""Cheers"" was released on September 8, 2021. On March 8, 2022, the band confirmed that their next album would be entitled Cheers after the lead single and released the album cover art. Cheers was released on May 27, 2022.

Based in Detroit in the old Detroit Novelty Machine Company building, it also had a foundry in Romeo, Michigan. It ceased operation in October 1907 following bankruptcy.

Company history

The company was fighting during the short time of its existence against litigation by stockholders of the predecessor company Detroit Novelty Machine Company, who were decidedly against the production of an automobile. Finally, the company went into bankruptcy in 1907. In 1908 bond holders in the bankrupt company were paid 24 percent on each $100.00 and the affairs of the company were closed.

Two of the most influential personalities in the early American automobile business were involved with the company. One was John North Willys, who soon after bought the Overland Automotive Division from the Standard Wheel Company which became the Willys-Overland Motor Company. The other gentleman was Josepf L. Hudson, a Detroit business man who earned a fortune with his department store. He backed Roy D. Chapin with the money needed to form an automobile company. Chapin named it in his honor the Hudson Motor Car Company.

Vehicles
In 1905 the company had three vehicles on sale all with a two-cylinder engine. The 12 HP Crown Runabout priced at US$750, the 16 HP Crown delivery car featuring a payload of 1500 lbs and a 24HP five-passenger Touring Car.

It seems that management was not satisfied with the performance of their products. So, early in 1906 they called in Edward T. Ross from Cadillac who developed a new car. His prototype drove in August, 1906, and the automobile was ready for sale for the 1907 model year. It was a two-cylinder automobile with a wheelbase of , featuring a 22/24 hp engine. It was dubbed the Model Two, but was also referred to as the ""Crown-Detroit"" or just ""Detroit"". Available were a runabout for US$1,500 and a touring for US$1,600. The company claimed its two-cylinder engine was as smooth as any four- or six-cylinder engine.

The whole production run for 1907 was sold in advance to John North Willys in Elmira, New York who became the exclusive selling agent, and referred to the 24HP car as the Detroit.

In the coming weeks will know the future of the Atléticos de San Germán and the Indios de Mayagüez in Baloncesto Superior Nacional (BSN).

Vacancy
The by-election was caused by the appointment of the sitting Coalition Liberal MP, Charles McCurdy as Minister of Food Control. Under the Parliamentary rules of the day, McCurdy was required to resign his seat and fight a by-election.

Candidates

Liberals
The Northampton Liberals agreed to support McCurdy, although the mood in the association was reported as being strongly in favour of the maintenance of the Liberal Party as an independent political force and wary of any moves which might involve fusion with the Coalition Conservatives or the creation of a Centre Party.

Conservatives
The Unionists agreed not to run a candidate against McCurdy in view of their party’s role in the Coalition government of David Lloyd George and the need to support Lloyd George “as the man who had guided the ship of state through the years of war into the calmer waters of peace”.

Labour
The Labour Party chose as their candidate Mrs Margaret Bondfield. Mrs Bondfield was originally a textiles worker who became a trade union official for the Shop Assistants' Union. She was also a founder-member and an officer of the Women's Labour League. She went on to become one of the first women elected to Parliament for Labour and the Britain’s first female Cabinet Minister.

Issues
Given Mc Curdy’s appointment the price of food was an early campaign issue with Labour attacking the government for high prices and McCurdy defending the actions of the Coalition in setting up a committee to investigate the price of food and the level of profits in the industry. However McCurdy was able to counter Labour criticism by reminding voters that this was not an issue which the Parliamentary Labour Party had raised at all during 1919 and the policy of the government to use regulation to maintain and check prices was essentially the same approach that Labour had adopted.

In her election address, Mrs Bondfield declared her support of a Capital levy on accumulated wealth, as opposed to indirect taxation, and the appointment of an International Economic Council to apportion supplies and credits according to need. She blamed British support for the White movement in the Russian Civil War for the high price of bread. She also supported the right of the Irish people to self-determination and independence from Britain.

In his election address, issued on 27 March 1920, McCurdy dealt exclusively with questions of food control and profiteering. He linked his appointment as Food Minister and the measures the government were taking with the issue of high prices. If he were re-elected, he argued, it would be a blow against the exploitation of the consumer and against the profiteer.   In view of his personal commitment to the job, Labour was finding it hard to paint McCurdy as a friend of the profit-mongers.

The result
McCurdy held his seat with a reduced majority (down to 3,371 from 7,275 at the 1918 general election and a reduced percentage of the poll (down to 55.6% from 62.7%). Labour had campaigned strongly. They had anticipated the appointment of McCurdy as a Minister and had adopted Mrs Bondfield in good time to begin nursing the constituency. They were well organised if some commentators felt their candidate’s sex was a disadvantage to their electoral prospects. The by-election at Camberwell North West held on the previous day had also resulted in a Coalition Liberal hold by a newly appointed minister, Thomas James Macnamara against the challenge of a female Labour candidate, Miss Susan Lawrence. Although Lawrence was to go on to gain election to Parliament later and Mrs Bondfield's persistence in Northampton paid off at the 1923 election, the failure of two women candidates in by-elections at the same time was a setback to the adoption of female candidates.

The result was also good news for Lloyd George who was pleased to see his newly appointed ministers being returned successfully to Parliament. By-election results early in the life of the government had not gone so well and Northampton and other results were regarded as something of a revival in government fortunes. The results also encouraged the Coalition Liberals to believe that any revival of Asquithian Liberalism was a mirage. However, as we have seen the failure of the Independent Liberals to contest Northampton was not solely a question of weakness of organisation or spirit. There was genuine confusion and soul-searching in the party over the Asquith-Lloyd George split and McCurdy was to face an Independent Liberal opponent at the 1922 as well as Labour.

She described this as ""a human project"" about learning. She states at the beginning that she is a lesbian but not transgender.

In the book, she describes her experiences as a man in strip clubs, on dates, and as part of a men's support group.

In order to effectively pose as a man, Vincent acquired a buzz cut and flattened her chest using a small sports bra. She also hired a makeup artist to fake a five o'clock shadow and trained for months to imitate a deeper male voice. She changed her diet and exercise regime to ""bulk up"" with more upper-body muscle.

Vincent joined a men's bowling team, where she says ""[the men] just took me in ... no questions asked."" She eventually became friends with them, even coming along to strip clubs and dating women who had no idea of her true sex. She later revealed that she was actually female to the men, who ""took it well.""

Vincent also recorded Self-Made Man as an audiobook for Penguin Highbridge.

Vincent wrote about how the only time she had ever been considered excessively feminine was during her stint as a man: her alter ego, Ned, was assumed to be gay on several occasions. Features of herself that had before been seen as ""butch"" were seen as oddly effeminate. Vincent stated that, after the experiment, she gained more sympathy for the male condition: ""Men are suffering. They have different problems than women have but they don't have it better. They need our sympathy, they need our love, and they need each other more than anything else. They need to be together.""

An inscription on a historical marker placed by the City of Falls Church, Virginia, at Taylor's Tavern, reads:

Two-story building with verandahs stood on 56 acres bought in 1856 by Wm. Taylor (part of 1731 271-acre T. Harrison grant). Tavern faced Alexandria-Leesburg Pike west of Junction with Georgetown Road (Wilson Blvd.).

Stuart's troops fortified Upton's & Munson's Hills. By October 1861 Union troops had reoccupied hills and added forts Taylor, Buffalo, and Ramsay as a separate group 4–5 miles west of main ring of Washington defenses.

The tavern was the site of the first aerial reconnaissance mission in the United States, a balloon flight by Thaddeus S. C. Lowe on June 24, 1861.  With the assistance of a detachment of fifteen men, he carried his craft, the Enterprise'', to the tavern site, from which he conducted a number of test flights.

The site of the tavern is today marked by Fort Taylor Park, a city park.

Pataki, 413 F.3d 266 (2d Cir. 2005), is an important precedent in the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit for the litigation of aboriginal title in the United States.  Applying the U.S. Supreme Court's recent ruling in City of Sherrill v. Oneida Indian Nation of New York (2005), a divided panel held that the equitable doctrine of laches bars all tribal land claims sounding in ejectment or trespass, for both tribal plaintiffs and the federal government as plaintiff-intervenor.

The ruling was the culmination of a two-decade-long litigation in the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York before Judge Neal Peters McCurn.  Pursuant to a jury verdict, the Cayuga Nation of New York had been awarded $247.9 million, representing the current fair market value and 204 years of rental value damages for 64,015 acres conveyed by the tribe to the state in violation of the Nonintercourse Act (including pre-judgement interest).

This precedent has effectively ended the viability of all aboriginal title litigation in the Second Circuit (Connecticut, New York, and Vermont), the site of nearly all of the unresolved Indian land claims in the United States. Since the ruling, no tribal plaintiff has overcome the laches defense in a land claim in the Second Circuit. Four dissenting Supreme Court justices had previously adopted the view of the Second Circuit in County of Oneida v. Oneida Indian Nation of New York State (1985); there, the majority did not reach the issue.

Prior history
The Second Circuit ruling came twenty-five years after the Cayuga filed their complaint in the Northern District of New York in 1980 challenging two conveyances of land to the state in 1795 and 1807, totaling 64,015 acres. The following year, a class of defendant land owners was certified.

In 1983, the Cayuga survived the defendant's motion to dismiss. Judge McCurn held that the Nonintercourse Act applied to the conveyances in question, held that the Cayuga had a valid cause of action, and rejected the affirmative defenses of: sovereign immunity pursuant to the Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution; statute of limitations, nonjusticiability, and abatement. McCurn's ruling preceded the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in County of Oneida v. Oneida Indian Nation of New York State (1985), which rejected several of the same affirmative defenses, among others.

In 1987, McCurn ruled on the motions for summary judgement. He held that: there was no evidence that the ""treaties"" through which New York State acquired the land had been ratified by the federal government; that the Indian Claims Commission did not have the authority to ratify the conveyances; and that his court had jurisdiction over the defendants. In 1990, he ruled that both the 1795 and 1807 conveyances violated the Nonintercourse Act, and were thus invalid. In 1991, interpreted the ""reservation"" terminology in the relevant treaty to also implicate that Act. McCurn also rejected the laches defense, on which the Second Circuit would eventually overturn his ruling. In response to the defendant's assertion of sovereign immunity as a defense, the federal government moved to intervene in the lawsuit, which was granted in November 1992.

Having established liability, the litigation turned to the remedy.  In 1999, McCurn ruled on the appropriate method to calculate damages.  The court rejected the state's arguments that damages should be limited to the fair market value of the land at the time of the transaction, without pre-judgement interest (the approximate method used by the Indian Claims Commission for statutory claims against the federal government). That same year, the court rejected ejectment as a remedy, thus ensuring that the Cayuga would be unable to recover possession of the lands; their remedy would be limited to monetary damages. The court also determined that joint and several liability would be inappropriate, and thus that the defendants would require separate trials. Finally, the court determined that the state would be able to offset from the eventual damages any amount of consideration paid in the original conveyances as well as the value of infrastructure improvements; moreover, the plaintiff's anthropologist's testimony would not be admissible on the question of valuation, the jury would not be able to hear evidence on laches from either party, the Eleventh Amendment would not bar damages, and the plaintiffs would not be able to claim emotional, psychological, or cultural damages—only the economic value of the land.

Preparing for trial, the court threw out the plaintiff's real estate expert and approved the government's real estate expert, applying the Daubert standard. He also clarified his prior ruling, to note that testimony on laches would be permitted inasmuch as it related to pre-judgement interest. In 2001, the jury returned a verdict for the Cayuga, calculating damages the current fair market value of the land and the fair rental value of the land over 204 years in excess of $36 million; with the addition of pre-judgement interest, the damages reached $247,911,999.42. The court also denied the defendant's post-trial motions, but stayed the collection of the judgement pending appeal.

Second Circuit opinion
The Second Circuit reversed, and entered judgement for the defendants.

Majority
Judge José A. Cabranes authored the panel opinion, joined by Rosemary S. Pooler. The court in large part relied on the U.S. Supreme Court's recent City of Sherrill v. Oneida Indian Nation of New York (2005) decision, which, it stated, ""dramatically altered the legal landscape against which we consider plaintiffs' claims."" In summary, the court noted:  ""We understand Sherrill to hold that equitable doctrines, such as laches, acquiescence, and impossibility, can, in appropriate circumstances, be applied to Indian land claims, even when such a claim is legally viable and within the statute of limitations."" While, Sherrill expressly did not disturb Oneida II (1985):  ""Because the Supreme Court in Oneida II expressly declined to decide whether laches would apply to such claims, this statement in Sherrill is not dispositive of whether laches would apply here.""

Parsing the Sherrill decision, the court concluded that the dispositive factor there was the ""disruptive nature of the claim itself."" Thus, the court opted for a broad reading of Sherrill:

<blockquote>Although we recognize that the Supreme Court did not identify a formal standard for assessing when these equitable defenses apply, the broadness of the Supreme Court's statements indicates to us that Sherrill'''s holding is not narrowly limited to claims identical to that brought by the Oneidas, seeking a revival of sovereignty, but rather, that these equitable defenses apply to ""disruptive"" Indian land claims more generally.</blockquote>

Rejecting the Cayuga and federal government's argument that Sherrill did not bar monetary remedies, the court held that ""this case involves comparably disruptive claims, and other, comparable remedies are in fact at issue."" The court emphasized that ""plaintiffs' claim is and has always been one sounding in ejectment; plaintiffs have asserted a continuing right to immediate possession as the basis of all of their claims, and have always sought ejectment of the current landowners as their preferred form of relief."" The court concluded that the District Court had ""'monetized' the ejectment remedy."" The court's treatment would apply the defense recognized in Sherrill to nearly all aboriginal title claims:

[T]his type of possessory land claim-seeking possession of a large swath of central New York State and the ejectment of tens of thousands of landowners . . . is indisputably disruptive. Indeed, this disruptiveness is inherent in the claim itself-which asks this Court to overturn years of settled land ownership-rather than an element of any particular remedy which would flow from the possessory land claim. Accordingly, we conclude that possessory land claims of this type are subject to the equitable considerations discussed in Sherrill.

Acknowledging that laches has traditionally been understood as an equitable doctrine, the court rejected any distinction between law and equity, holding that it barred ""any remedy flowing from this possessory land claim."" The court justified this holding with reference to the sui generis nature of aboriginal title. ""To summarize,"" the court recapitulated:

[T]he import of Sherrill is that ""disruptive,"" forward-looking claims, a category exemplified by possessory land claims, are subject to equitable defenses, including laches. Insofar as the Cayugas' claim in the instant case is unquestionably a possessory land claim, it is subject to laches. . . . The fact that, nineteen years into the case, at the damages stage, the District Court substituted a monetary remedy for plaintiffs' preferred remedy of ejectment cannot salvage the claim, which was subject to dismissal ab initio. To frame this point a different way: if the Cayugas filed this complaint today, exactly as worded, a District Court would be required to find the claim subject to the defense of laches under Sherrill and could dismiss on that basis.

The court held that laches equally barred both the plaintiff's cause of action for ejectment and the plaintiff's cause of action for trespass. Acknowledging that the federal government had ""traditionally not been subject to the defense of laches,"" the court did not interpret this as a ""per se rule."" The decision concluded with praise for the McCurn:

Our decision to reverse the judgment of the District Court and enter judgment for defendants should in no way be interpreted as a reflection on the District Court's efforts and rulings in this case. We recognize and applaud the thoughtful and painstaking efforts, over many years, of Judge Neil P. McCurn, who presided over this and related land claims in upstate New York with fairness and due regard to the rights and interests of all parties as well as with a keen appreciation of the complexities of the subject matter and of the relevant law. Our decision is based on a subsequent ruling by the Supreme Court, which could not be anticipated by Judge McCurn in his handling of this case over more than twenty years.

While claiming that it was applying ""laches"", the majority argument did not satisfy any of the traditional requirements for a laches defense.  Among other things, laches requires delay in pressing a claim, but the Cayuga Nation had pressed its claim repeatedly since the 1800s, being stymied by various rules which prevented Indian nations from being heard in court.  The doctrine invented for the purpose of denying the Seneca claim has been described as ""New Laches"" due to its lack of resemblance to the laches doctrine; it has been explicitly described as a new doctrine by later courts.

Dissent
Judge Janet C. Hall of the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut, sitting by designation, dissented.  Hall argued:  ""While [Sherrill] has an impact on this case, it does not compel the conclusion that the plaintiffs are without any remedy . . . ."" Hall would have barred the ejectment of the present landowners, but not the money damages. With respect to the ejectment cause of action, Hall would have held that: ""[W]here a plaintiff seeks ejectment damages, rather than restoration of a possession interest, application of the doctrine of laches to such a money damage claim is rarely if ever justified."" Hall also would not have applied laches to the trespass cause of action.

Nor would Hall have applied laches to the federal government. Distinguishing the cases cited by the panel majority, Hall noted that ""[t]hese cases cannot support the proposition that this Court has the authority to craft a federal common law defense of laches against an Indian land claim sought by the United States."" In concluding, Hall examined the language of Sherill in greater depth, arguing that Sherill ""does not reach as far as the majority reads it.""

Subsequent history
Although both the Solicitor General of the United States and the Cayuga asked the Supreme Court to review the Second Circuit's holding, the Court declined to grant certiorari.

Population

History 
Commentry was home to Compagnie de Commentry-Fourchambault-Decazeville, thanks to an important coal deposit. The coal mine fueled a huge growth in population, from under 1,000 to more than 12,000, while Stéphane Mony was its CEO (1840–1884). 
Commentry was the first commune ever to elect a socialist mayor: Christophe Thivrier was elected the 6th of June 1882. The Socialist Party of France was founded in Commentry in September 1902.

Economy
Commentry gave its name to a coal field over 21 square kilometres in extent, and historically had important foundries and forges.

Science
Charles Brongniart discovered many fossils near Commentry, including Meganeura in the Stephanian stage coal measures in 1880.

Personalities
 Jean Bayet (1882–1969) Professor of Latin Language and Literature at the Sorbonne, whose grandfather Gilbert Bayet was mayor of Commentry 1871–1873. 
 Henri Fayol (1841–1925) mining engineer, developed Fayolism, an approach to management and administration.
 Abel Gance (1889–1981) film director and producer, raised by maternal grandparents in Commentry until the age of eight.

HSCC is a rural cancer centre in the heart of North Kashmir. The Centre is part of the Hakim Sanaullah Specialist Hospital and providing quality cancer care to the neglected rural population in the region. Currently the centre provides Medical Oncology, Surgical Oncology and Diagnostic/Imaging services. The centre remains part of a global effort towards managing cancer in a limited resource setting. Over two-thirds of Kashmiris live in rural areas with access to a health care system marred by deficiencies. An overburdened urban health care setup adds to the misery of these rural millions.

Hakim Sanaullah Specialist Hospital & Cancer Centre is an effort to overcome these deficiencies. The institution is a tertiary health care facility with the first rural cancer centre of Jammu and Kashmir catering to a population of over 1 million. By providing quality health care, accessible and affordable to these millions, the institution aims at changing the landscape of health care services in the region in particular, and the state as a whole.

Latest news 
On 29 June 2009, Dr Shuaib Zaidi a surgical oncologist, assisted by Dr Yusuf Tak, an anaesthetist, implanted a Chemoport Device, which is an embedded device within the layers of the skin, to act as a port for the administration of chemotherapeutic drugs for cancer. Also, on the next day, a limb-salvage surgery was performed, saving the left lower limb of a patient, who had been deemed incurable, and advised amputation of the part. As of 9 August 2009, the patient is doing fine.

Plans are afoot to bring a CT scan to the hospital, and also to establish a telemedicine link with national and international cancer institutions to further cancer care research in Kashmir.

In October 2013, the first dialysis centre in North Kashmir was started in the premises of the Hakim Sanaullah Cancer Centre. Currently, two dialysis machines, installed by Fresenius Kabi, are functional, and plans are in foot to expand the services soon.

512,"['Metals \n Many dissolve ored suspended metal salts exert harmful effects in the environment sometimes at very low concentrations .', 'These saprophytic organisms may thened be predated upon by protozoa , rotifers and , in cleaner waters , Bryozoa which consume suspend organic particles including viruses and pathogenic bacteria .']","Most organisms involved in water purification originate from the waste, wastewater or water stream itself or arrive as resting spore of some form from the atmosphere. In a very few cases, mostly associated with constructed wetlands, specific organisms are planted to maximise the efficiency of the process.

Role of biota
Biota are an essential component of most sewage treatment processes and many water purification systems. Most of the organisms involved are derived from the waste, wastewater or water stream itself or from the atmosphere or soil water. However some  processes, especially those involved in removing very low concentrations of contaminants, may use engineered eco-systems created by the introduction of specific plants and sometimes animals.  Some full scale sewage treatment plants also use constructed wetlands to provide treatment

Pollutants in wastewater

Pathogens
Parasites, bacteria and viruses may be injurious to the health of people or livestock ingesting the polluted water.  These pathogens may have originated from sewage or from domestic or wild bird or mammal feces.  Pathogens may be killed by ingestion by larger organisms, oxidation, infection by phages or irradiation by ultraviolet sunlight unless that sunlight is blocked by plants or suspended solids.

Suspended solids
Particles of soil or organic matter may be suspended in the water.  Such materials may give the water a cloudy or turbid appearance.  The anoxic decomposition of some organic materials may give rise to obnoxious or unpleasant smells as sulphur containing compounds are released.

Nutrients
Compounds containing nitrogen, potassium or phosphorus may encourage growth of aquatic plants and thus increase the available energy in the local food-web. this can lead to increased concentrations of suspended organic material. In some cases specific micro-nutrients may be required to allow the available nutrients to be fully utilised by living organisms. In other cases, the presence of specific chemical species may produce toxic effects limiting growth and abundance of living matter.

Metals
Many dissolved or suspended metal salts exert harmful effects in the environment sometimes at very low concentrations. Some aquatic plants are able to remove very low metal concentrations, with the metals ending up bound to clay or other mineral particles.

Organisms
Saprophytic bacteria and fungi can convert organic matter into living cell mass, carbon dioxide, water and a range of metabolic by-products.  These saprophytic organisms may then be predated upon by protozoa, rotifers and, in cleaner waters, Bryozoa which consume suspended organic particles including viruses and pathogenic bacteria.  Clarity of the water may begin to improve as the protozoa are subsequently consumed by rotifers and cladocera.  Purifying bacteria, protozoa, and rotifers must either be mixed throughout the water or have the water circulated past them to be effective.  Sewage treatment plants mix these organisms as activated sludge or circulate water past organisms living on trickling filters or rotating biological contactors.

Aquatic vegetation may provide similar surface habitat for purifying bacteria, protozoa, and rotifers in a pond or marsh setting; although water circulation is often less effective.  Plants and algae have the additional advantage of removing nutrients from the water; but some of those nutrients will be returned to the water when the plants die unless the plants are removed from the water.  Because of the complex chemistry of Phosphorus much of this element is in an unavailable form unless decomposition creates anoxic conditions which render the phosphorus available for re-uptake. Plants also provide shade, a refuge for fish, and oxygen for aerobic bacteria. In addition, fish can limit pests such as mosquitoes.  Fish and waterfowl feces return waste to the water, and their feeding habits may increase turbidity.  Cyanobacteria have the disadvantageous ability to add nutrients from the air to the water being purified and to generate toxins in some cases.

The choice of organism depends on the local climate different species and other factors. Indigenous species usually tend to be better adapted to the local environment.

Macrophytes

The choice of plants in engineered wet-lands or managed lagoons is dependent on the purification requirements of the system and this may involve plantings of varying plant species at a range of depths to achieve the  required goal.

Plants purify water by consuming excess nutrients and by providing surfaces upon which a wide range of other purifying organisms can live. They also are effective oxygenators in sunlight. They also have the ability to translocate chemicals between their submerged foliage and their root systems and this is of significance in engineered wet-lands designed to de-toxify waste waters. Plants that have been used in temperate climates include Nymphea alba, Phragmites australis, Sparganium erectum, Iris pseudacorus, Schoenoplectus lacustris and Carex acutiformis.

Where oxygenation is a critical requirement  Stratiotes aloides,  Hydrocharis morsus-ranae, Acorus calamus, Myriophyllum species and Elodea have been used.
Hydrocharis morsus-ranae and Nuphar lutea have been used where shade and cover are required

Fish
Fish are frequently the top level predators in a managed treatment eco-system and in some case may simply be a mono-culture of herbivorous species. Management of multi-species fisheries requires careful management and may involve a range of fish species including bottom-feeders and predatory species to limit population growth of the herbivorous fish

Rotifers
Rotifers are microscopic complex organisms and are filter feeders removing fine particulate matter from water. They occur naturally in aerobic lagoons, activated sludge processes, in trickling filters and in final settlement tanks and are a significant factor in removing suspended bacterial cells and algae from the water column.

Annelids
Annelid worms are essential to the effective operation of trickling filters  helping to remove excess bio-mass and enhancing natural sloughing of the bio-film. Supernumerary worms are very commonly found in the drainage troughs around trickling filters and in the final settlement sludge. Annelids also play a key role in lagoon treatment systems and in the effective working or engineered wet-lands. In this environment worms are a principal force in mixing in the upper few centimetres of the sediment layer exposing organic material to both oxidative and anoxic environments aiding the complete breakdown of most organics. They are also a key ingredient in the food-chain transferring energy upwards to fish and aquatic birds.

Protozoa
The range of protozoan species found is very wide but may include species of the following genera:
 Amoeba
 Arcella
 Blepharisma
 Didinium
 Euglena
 Hypotrich
 Paramecium
 Suctoria
 Stylonychia
 Vorticella

Insects
 Chironomidae bloodworm larva
 Podura aquatica water springtail
 Psychodidae drain fly or filter fly larva

Bacteria
Bacteria are probably the most significant group of organisms involved in water purification and are ubiquitous in all biological purification environments. Some such as Sphaerotilus natans are typically associated with grossly polluted waters , but even in such environments the bacteria are degrading the organic material present.

The rampart at its highest point is  high.

The structure has a width of  and is a discontinuous rampart  high. This rampart surrounds a sediment-filled crater that is  deep beneath the surrounding terrain. The deepest point is  high above sea level. The rampart is formed from two main bodies each up to  wide with gaps separating them. It is located in the southeastern portion of the moat which surrounds the 4 mya  La Pacana caldera.

Coquena formed along an outer ring fault. The caldera wall reaches its highest height in the area of Corral de Coquena. The basement beneath Corral de Coquena is slightly higher than the general Pacana caldera floor. The ring belongs to the post-caldera activity phase of La Pacana. The dating is uncertain; the ring is constructed on top of the Pampa Chamaca ignimbrite (2.4 mya) but one date obtained from the ring is 4.4 ± 0.3 mya, obtained on biotite. The date of the ring is more likely to be incorrect. Other estimates indicate that Pampa Chamaca overlies the Corral de Coquena deposits, an as yet unsettled question. The Atana ignimbrite that clearly pre-dates the Coquena ring has been reassessed as being 3.9-4.2 ± 0.1-0.2 mya old, reducing the estimated age of Corral de Coquena as well.
 
The rampart is formed by glassy rhyolite, or dacite, typical of the potassium-rich calc-alkaline series of the Central Volcanic Zone. It has a phenocryst content of 20%.

Dacite clasts cover the inward-sloping walls of the rampart. Outwards, lobes and terraces are found possibly formed by agglutinating dacite forming lava flows. The rhyolites too show evidence of flow structures and bedding.

In the Pliocene, destruction of a lava dome resulted in the formation of a pyroclastic deposit around Corral de Coquena. These deposits consists of volcanic ash, pumice and rhyolite, forming layers with angular pumice and ash and an abovelying layer of vitric rhyolite, similar to the rampart wall. The deposits are up to  thick and cover a surface of  . Total volume is less than . A later layer of reworked Atana and Corral de Coquena pyroclastics extends  away.

Aside from the lower phenocryst content, this lava is very similar to Morro Negro, another Pacana lava dome. Ilmenite, magnetite and quartz are found in the rhyolite. A water content of 3-4% and temperatures of  have been estimated on the basis of composition. The magma that formed Corral de Coquena is probably related to magmas that formed the Atana ignimbrite and were not erupted during that activity phase. Subsequently, part of these leaked out and formed Corral de Coquena.

The appearance of Corral de Coquena is similar to a maar. Despite the arid climate in the area which has persisted since the Miocene, the local water table ( beneath the ground on the basis of water levels in nearby lakes) may have been high enough to trigger phreatomagmatic activity. This activity formed the crater. Later, lava itself erupted in the form of lava fountaining. Spatters formed by the fountaining then formed the Corral de Coquena rampart. This is an unusual mode of activity for silicic magmas but also documented at Huaynaputina and the Cerro Chascon-Runtu Jarita complex.

It was featured in the third trailer released the next day, and also appeared in the movie and end credits. Talking about the song, Jonas stated, ""I wrote this song with good friends of mine...and we wrote about feeling accepted and feeling loved, wherever that place is for you. For me it's home, it's my family, people I have closest to me; and the experiences we've shared."" On September 21, 2017, a brand new trailer of the movie Ferdinand was released with contains a part of the song. The song was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song.

Critical reception
Laura Klonowski of Celebmix gave it a positive review, noting that ""'Home' is a real feelgood, toe-tapping pop smash, and is the perfect song for an animation kids movie. The lyrics are fun and easy to learn which is great for the young audience, while the strong hooks, and catchy beat make it mature enough for older listeners to enjoy. And Nick Jonas' vocals sound incredible. It's a really great track that just makes you feel happy. The lyrics are full of meaning and sentiment, and overall it's just a really classic pop hit. Time and time again the former Jonas Brothers star proves himself to be one of our generations best vocalists and songwriters and with 'Home' he has once again showcased his immense talents to the world. He really is one of the best artists of our time.""

Life and works

Emil Bisttram was born in Nagylak, Hungary in 1895 (today Nădlac, Romania). When he was 11 years old, he immigrated with his family to New York City, where they settled in the Lower East Side. He was a talented artist, and after a few years began his schooling at the National Academy of Art and Design, then Cooper Union, Parsons, and The Art Student's League. He began teaching soon after completing school, first at the New York School of Fine and Applied Arts, and then at the Master Institute of the Roerich Museum.

Bisttram first visited Taos in the summer of 1930. He later fell in love with the scenery and moved there. In 1931 he won a Guggenheim Fellowship to study mural painting. The fellowship enabled Bisttram to travel to Mexico where he studied mural painting with the world famous muralist Diego Rivera. During the Great Depression he completed numerous federally supported mural commissions, including at the Robert F. Kennedy Building in Washington D.C., The Taos County Courthouse, New Mexico, and the Federal Courthouse in Roswell, New Mexico. After returning to Taos in 1932, Bistrram started the Heptagon Gallery and the Taos School of Art. In 1938, Bisttram founded the Transcendental Painting Group with Raymond Jonson and several other Santa Fe artists.

In 1952, Bisttram co-founded the Taos Art Association, and later in 1959 won the Grand Prize for painting at the New Mexico State Fair.

In 1970, Emil Bisttram served as a judge and monitor for a statewide arts grant competition for art to be placed in the newly constructed County Courthouse building, designed by architect Bill Menningbach of Taos. Ken Drew, a local sculptor, won the competition. Bisttram oversaw the project for the next two years, and in June 1972 Drew completed the installation. Then-Senator Joseph Montoya and other dignitaries from Santa Fe officiated at the dedication ceremonies. In 1975, his birthday, April 7, was declared ""Emil Bisttram Day,"" a New Mexico state holiday.

Costain's 1952 novel of the same name. It was Saville's last film and marked the acting debut of Paul Newman; despite being nominated for a Golden Globe Award for his performance, Newman later called it ""the worst motion picture produced during the 1950s"".

Plot
A Greek artisan from Antioch is commissioned to cast the cup of Christ in silver and sculpt around its rim the faces of the disciples and Jesus himself. He travels to Jerusalem and eventually to Rome to complete the task. Meanwhile, a nefarious interloper is trying to convince the crowds that he is the new Messiah by using nothing more than cheap parlor tricks.

Cast
It marked the film début of Paul Newman as an artist named Basil (né Ambrose), who was given the task of making a silver chalice to house the Holy Grail. It also featured Virginia Mayo as Helena, Pier Angeli as Deborra, Jack Palance as Simon Magus, the villain, Joseph Wiseman as Mijamin, Alexander Scourby as Saint Luke, Walter Hampden as Joseph of Arimathea, Lorne Greene as Peter, and a brief appearance by Natalie Wood, who plays Helena as a young woman. It was also the feature film débuts of Greene and Robert Middleton.

Style

The film featured unusual semiabstract settings and decor, created by the stage designer Rolfe Gerard in a striking departure from the normal practice of the day for Hollywood biblical ""epics"". A notable musical score by Franz Waxman was nominated for an Academy Award.

Release

Premiere
The film had its world premiere in the small town of Saranac Lake, New York, which won a competition selling Christmas Seals. Saville, Mayo, Angeli and Palance attended, and participated in, a parade around the time of the town's annual winter carnival. The premiere itself was hosted by television personality Art Linkletter.

Home media
The film was released on VHS and, in 2009, on DVD.

Reception

Critical reception
A. H. Weiler of The New York Times wrote that the filmmakers ""have come up with a spectacle-filled adventure easily fitted to the lush hues of WarnerColor and the king-sized screen of Cinemascope. But in providing a modicum of excitement and generous portions of extravaganza they have turned out a cumbersome and sometimes creaking vehicle that takes too long to reach its goal.""

Variety wrote, ""Like the Costain book, the picture is overdrawn and sometimes tedious, but producer-director Victor Saville still manages to instill interest in what's going on, and even hits a feeling of excitement occasionally. John L. Scott of the Los Angeles Times wrote that ""it is colorful at times, rather tedious in other portions."" Richard L. Coe of The Washington Post wrote, ""Lester Samuels' screen play meanders self-consciously and Victor Saville's direction is just as overblown. I found nothing remarkable in the performances of the leads, Paul Newman (not as good as he's been on TV), Pier Angeli, Virginia Mayo (more synthetically blondined than ever), Jack Palance (an overtheatric villain), or even Walter Hampden (the ancient Joseph)."" Harrison's Reports thought the film ""deserves a high rating from the production point of view,"" but was ""only moderately interesting"" as entertainment. John McCarten of The New Yorker wrote that the film ""has to do with the pursuit of the Grail by the most dismal assortment of characters I've encountered in a decade."" The Monthly Film Bulletin wrote, ""Any true religious atmosphere in this vulgar and incongruous fancy-dress parade is out of the question ... Some may discover uproarious moments, many will be repelled by the tastelessness of the spectacle as a whole.""

Writing in the first edition of his Film Guide in 1977, Leslie Halliwell described the film as ""[p]o-faced biblical hokum ... with howlingly bad casting and direction ... [a] sea of boredom"", assigning it 0 stars out of 4.

The elaborate musical score by Franz Waxman has been prized more than the nearly forgotten movie. Elmer Bernstein recorded a suite in 1975, and Film Score Monthly released the surviving portions of the soundtrack recording in 2007.

Newman's view
Paul Newman was apparently not proud of his performance. When the film was broadcast on television in 1966, he took out an advertisement in a Hollywood trade paper apologizing for his performance, and requesting people not to watch the film. This backfired, and the broadcast received unusually high ratings. The film is sometimes referred to as Paul Newman and the Holy Grail.  Newman called the film ""the worst motion picture produced during the 1950s"", and once screened it for guests at his home, handing out pots, wooden spoons, and whistles and encouraging the audience to offer noisy critiques.

Legacy
Martin Scorsese wrote about the film as a guilty pleasure in 1978 saying:
The Silver Chalice is one of the reasons I hired Boris Leven to design New York, New York. Giant and The Silver Chalice: any man who could design those two films . . . that's it, I had to have him. The Silver Chalice, which is a bad picture, has no authenticity. It's purely theatrical, and this is mainly due to the sets. They're clean and clear; it's almost like another life, another world. We don't know what ancient Rome was like, so why not take the attitude Fellini had with Satyricon: make it science fiction in reverse? The Silver Chalice came close to that, fifteen years earlier.

Historical, astronomical and ISO year numbering systems

Historians 

The Anno Domini era was introduced in 525 by Scythian monk Dionysius Exiguus (c. 470 – c. 544), who used it to identify the years on his Easter table. He introduced the new era to avoid using the Diocletian era, based on the accession of Roman Emperor Diocletian, as he did not wish to continue the memory of a persecutor of Christians. In the preface to his Easter table, Dionysius stated that the ""present year"" was ""the consulship of Probus Junior [Flavius Anicius Probus Iunior]"" which was also 525 years ""since the incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ"". How he arrived at that number is unknown.

Dionysius Exiguus did not use 'AD' years to date any historical event. This practice began with the English cleric Bede (c. 672–735), who used AD years in his  (731), popularizing the era. Bede also used, only once, a term similar to the modern English term 'before Christ', but that practice did not catch on until almost a thousand years later—when books by Dionysius Petavius treating calendar science gained popularity. Bede did not sequentially number days of the month, weeks of the year, or months of the year. However, he did number many of the days of the week using the counting origin one in Ecclesiastical Latin.

Previous Christian histories used several titles for dating events:  (""in the year of the world"") beginning on the purported first day of creation; or  (""in the year of Adam"") beginning at the creation of Adam five days later (or the sixth day of creation according to the Genesis creation narrative) as used by Africanus; or  (""in the year of Abraham"") beginning 3,412 years after Creation according to the Septuagint, used by Eusebius of Caesarea; all of which assigned ""one"" to the year beginning at Creation, or the creation of Adam, or the birth of Abraham, respectively. Bede continued this earlier tradition relative to the AD era.

In chapter II of book I of Ecclesiastical History, Bede stated that Julius Caesar invaded Britain ""in the year 693 after the building of Rome, but the sixtieth year before the incarnation of our Lord"", while stating in chapter III, ""in the year of Rome 798, Claudius"" also invaded Britain and ""within a very few days ... concluded the war in ... the forty-sixth [year] from the incarnation of our Lord"". Although both dates are wrong, they are sufficient to conclude that Bede did not include a year zero between BC and AD: 798 − 693 + 1 (because the years are inclusive) = 106, but 60 + 46 = 106, which leaves no room for a year zero. The modern English term ""before Christ"" (BC) is only a rough equivalent, not a direct translation, of Bede's Latin phrase  (""before the time of the lord's incarnation""), which was itself never abbreviated. Bede's singular use of 'BC' continued to be used sporadically throughout the Middle Ages.

Neither the concept of nor a symbol for zero existed in the system of Roman numerals. The Babylonian system of the BC era had used the idea of ""nothingness"" without considering it a number, and the Romans enumerated in much the same way. Wherever a modern zero would have been used, Bede and Dionysius Exiguus did use Latin number words, or the word  (meaning ""nothing"") alongside Roman numerals. Zero was invented in India in the sixth century, and was either transferred or reinvented by the Arabs by about the eighth century. The Arabic numeral for zero (0) did not enter Europe until the thirteenth century. Even then, it was known only to very few, and only entered widespread use in Europe by the seventeenth century.

The  nomenclature was not widely used in Western Europe until the 9th century, and the  to  historical year was not uniform throughout Western Europe until 1752. The first extensive use (hundreds of times) of 'BC' occurred in  by Werner Rolevinck in 1474, alongside years of the world (). The terms anno Domini, Dionysian era, Christian era, vulgar era, and common era were used interchangeably between the Renaissance and the 19th century, at least in Latin. But vulgar era fell out of use in English at the beginning of the 20th century after vulgar acquired the meaning of ""offensively coarse"", replacing its original meaning of ""common"" or ""ordinary"". Consequently, historians regard all these eras as equal.

Historians have never included a year zero. This means that between, for example,   and  , there are 999 years: 500 years BC, and 499 years AD preceding 500. In common usage anno Domini 1 is preceded by the year 1 BC, without an intervening year zero. Neither the choice of calendar system (whether Julian or Gregorian) nor the era (Anno Domini or Common Era) determines whether a year zero will be used. If writers do not use the convention of their group (historians or astronomers), they must explicitly state whether they include a year 0 in their count of years, otherwise their historical dates will be misunderstood.

Astronomers 

In astronomy, for the year AD 1 and later it is common to assign the same numbers as the Anno Domini notation, which in turn is numerically equivalent to the Common Era notation. But the discontinuity between 1 AD and 1 BC makes it cumbersome to compare ancient and modern dates. So the year before 1 AD is designated 0, the year before 0 is −1, and so on.

The letters ""AD"", ""BC"", ""CE"", or ""BCE"" are omitted. So 1 BC in historical notation is equivalent to 0 in astronomical notation, 2 BC is equivalent to −1, etc. Sometimes positive years are preceded by the + sign. This year numbering notation was introduced by the astronomer Jacques Cassini in 1740.

History of astronomical usage 
In 1627, the German astronomer Johannes Kepler, in his Rudolphine Tables, first used an astronomical year essentially as a year zero. He labeled it Christi and inserted it between years labeled  and  BC and AD today, on the ""mean motion"" pages of the Sun, Moon, and planets. In 1702, the French astronomer Philippe de la Hire labeled a year as  and placed it at the end of the years labeled  (BC), and immediately before the years labeled  (AD), on the mean motion pages in his , thus adding the number designation 0 to Kepler's .

Finally, in 1740, the transition was completed by French astronomer Jacques Cassini , who is traditionally credited with inventing year zero. In his , Cassini labeled the year simply as 0, and placed it at the end of years labeled  (BC), and immediately before years labeled  (AD).

ISO 8601 
ISO 8601:2004 (and previously ISO 8601:2000, but not ISO 8601:1988) explicitly uses astronomical year numbering in its date reference systems. (Because it also specifies the use of the proleptic Gregorian calendar for all years before 1582, some readers incorrectly assume that a year zero is also included in that proleptic calendar, but it is not used with the BC/AD era.) The ""basic"" format for year 0 is the four-digit form 0000, which equals the historical year 1 BC. Several ""expanded"" formats are possible: −0000 and +0000, as well as five- and six-digit versions. Earlier years are also negative four-, five- or six-digit years, which have an absolute value one less than the equivalent BC year, hence -0001 = 2 BC.  Because only ISO 646 (7-bit ASCII) characters are allowed by ISO 8601, the minus sign is represented by a hyphen-minus.

Computing
Programming libraries may implement a year zero, an example being the Perl CPAN module DateTime.

South Asian calendars 
Most eras used with Hindu and Buddhist calendars, such as the Saka era or the Kali Yuga, begin with the year 0. These calendars mostly use elapsed, expired, or complete years, in contrast with most calendars from other parts of the world which use current years. A complete year had not yet elapsed for any date in the initial year of the epoch, thus the number 1 cannot be used. Instead, during the first year the indication of 0 years (elapsed) is given in order to show that the epoch is less than 1 year old. This is similar to the Western method of stating a person's age – people do not reach age one until one year has elapsed since birth (but their age during the year beginning at birth is specified in months or fractional years, not as age zero). However, if ages were specified in years and months, such a person would be said to be, for example, 0 years and 6 months or 0.5 years old. This is analogous to the way time is shown on a 24-hour clock: during the first hour of a day, the time elapsed is 0 hours, n minutes.

546,"['It is also rotationally invarianted , in that a rotation apply to the system leaves the helicity unchanged .', 'Consider , for example , aed baseball , pitch as a gyroball , so that its spin axis is aligned with the direction of the pitch .']","In physics, helicity is the projection of the spin onto the direction of momentum.

Overview
The angular momentum J is the sum of an orbital angular momentum L and a spin S. The relationship between orbital angular momentum L, the position operator r and the linear momentum (orbit part) p is

so L's  component in the direction of p is zero. Thus, helicity is  just the projection of the spin onto the direction of linear momentum. The helicity of a particle is positive ("" right-handed"") if the direction of its spin is the same as the direction of its motion and negative (""left-handed"") if opposite. 

Helicity is conserved. That is, the helicity commutes with the Hamiltonian, and thus, in the absence of external forces, is time-invariant. It is also rotationally invariant, in that a rotation applied to the system leaves the helicity unchanged. Helicity, however, is not Lorentz invariant; under the action of a Lorentz boost, the helicity may change sign. Consider, for example, a baseball, pitched as a gyroball, so that its spin axis is aligned with the direction of the pitch. It will have one helicity with respect to the point of view of the players on the field, but would appear to have a flipped helicity in any frame moving faster than the ball (e.g. a bullet train, as both bullet trains and gyroballs are popular in Japan, while trains are popular in special relativity).

Comparison with chirality 
In this sense, helicity can be contrasted to chirality, which is Lorentz invariant, but is not a constant of motion for massive particles. For massless particles, the two coincide: the helicity is equal to the chirality, and both are Lorentz invariant, and are constants of motion.

In quantum mechanics, angular momentum is quantized, and thus helicity is quantized as well. Because the eigenvalues of spin with respect to an axis have discrete values, the eigenvalues of helicity are also discrete. For a massive particle of spin , the eigenvalues of helicity are , , , ..., −. In massless particles, not all of these correspond to physical degrees of freedom: for example, the photon is a massless spin 1 particle with helicity eigenvalues −1 and +1, and the eigenvalue 0 is not physically present.

All known spin  particles have non-zero mass; however, for hypothetical massless spin  particles (the Weyl spinors), helicity is equivalent to the chirality operator multiplied by . By contrast, for massive particles, distinct chirality states (e.g., as occur in the weak interaction charges) have both positive and negative helicity components, in ratios proportional to the mass of the particle.

A treatment of the helicity of gravitational waves can be found in Weinberg. In short, they come in only two forms: +2 and −2, while the +1, 0 and −1 helicities are non-dynamical (can be gauged away).

Little group

In  dimensions, the little group for a massless particle is the double cover of SE(2). This has unitary representations which are invariant under the SE(2) ""translations"" and transform as  under a SE(2) rotation by . This is the helicity  representation. There is also another unitary representation which transforms non-trivially under the SE(2) translations. This is the continuous spin representation.

In  dimensions, the little group is the double cover of SE() (the case where  is more complicated because of anyons, etc.). As before, there are unitary representations which don't transform under the SE()  ""translations"" (the ""standard"" representations) and ""continuous spin"" representations.

Biography
Makovsky was the son of collector, Egor Ivanovich Makovsky, who was one of the founders of the Moscow Art School. Vladimir had two brothers, Nikolay Makovsky and Konstantin Makovsky, and one sister, Alexandra Makovskaya, all of whom were famous painters. Vladimir studied at the Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture, and Architecture. He finished his studies in 1869 and the following year became one of the founding members of the Association of Travelling Art Exhibitions, where his many years of prolific work brought him to a leading position

Makovsky's work was defined by a perpetual humor as well as blatant irony and scorn. During the seventies his paintings dealt primarily with small-town folk. His pictures, ""The Grape-juice Seller"" (1879), ""Fruit-Preserving"" (1876) and ""The Congratulator"" (1878) depict various scenes where the mood is finely conceived and almost laughter-inducing. Other works of his, such as ""The Benefactor"" (1874) and ""The Convict"" (1878) are profoundly socially conscious. In them, Makovsky either criticizes the false sympathy of the aristocracy towards the poor, or draws attention to the oppression and persecution by the tsarist gendarmerie. In 1878, he became an academician.

In the eighties, during the time of Russian ""democratic"" painting, Makovsky produced some of his most valued works. In 1882, he was made professor at the Moscow Art School after the death of Vasili Perov. Some of Makovsky's greatest works of this period include ""In the Ante-room of the Court of Conciliation"" (1880), ""The Released Prisoner"" (1882), and ""The Collapse of the Bank"" (1881). From the end of the 1880s, Makovsky began to produce more gloomy works. Quintessential works of this period include ""You Shall Not Go"" (1892), and ""On the Boulevard"" (1888).

In 1894, Makovsky became Rector of the Preparatory school of the Academy of Art. After the First Russian Revolution, he painted ""January 9, 1905, on Vasilyev Island"" in which he depicts the armed police firing at defenseless people. In another painting ""The Sacrifices on the Khodyn Field"" in which a thousand people lost their lives during the coronation ceremony in 1896 of Nicholas II, he again stood uncompromisingly on the side of the oppressed people. After the 1917 October Revolution, Makovsky helped carry over the realist traditions to the early stages of Socialist Realism.

Critical reception and analysis
In an essay entitled ""Vampire Troubles: Loyalism and Resurrection Man"", academic Steve Baker argues that the film can be interpreted as a vampire film, ""situating it within a loyalist self image of vampirism"". In fact, Stuart Townsend's performance in this film was what prompted Michael Rymer to cast him the role of the Vampire Lestat in Queen of the Damned.

It is a reaction to the intensity of the bombardment and fighting that produced a helplessness appearing variously as panic and being scared, flight, or an inability to reason, sleep, walk or talk.

During the war, the concept of shell shock was ill-defined. Cases of ""shell shock"" could be interpreted as either a physical or psychological injury, or as a lack of moral fibre. The term shell shock is still used by the United States’ Department of Veterans Affairs to describe certain parts of PTSD, but mostly it has entered into memory, and it is often identified as the signature injury of the war.

In World War II and thereafter, diagnosis of ""shell shock"" was replaced by that of combat stress reaction, a similar but not identical response to the trauma of warfare and bombardment.

Origin
During the early stages of World War I in 1914, soldiers from the British Expeditionary Force began to report medical symptoms after combat, including tinnitus, amnesia, headaches, dizziness, tremors, and hypersensitivity to noise. While these symptoms resembled those that would be expected after a physical wound to the brain, many of those reporting sick showed no signs of head wounds. By December 1914 as many as 10% of British officers and 4% of enlisted men were experiencing ""nervous and mental shock"".

The term ""shell shock"" was coined during the Battle of Loos to reflect an assumed link between the symptoms and the effects of explosions from artillery shells. The term was first published in 1915 in an article in The Lancet by Charles Myers. Some 60–80% of shell shock cases displayed acute neurasthenia, while 10% displayed what would now be termed symptoms of conversion disorder, including mutism and fugue.

The number of shell shock cases grew during 1915 and 1916 but it remained poorly understood medically and psychologically. Some physicians held the view that it was a result of hidden physical damage to the brain, with the shock waves from bursting shells creating a cerebral lesion that caused the symptoms and could potentially prove fatal. Another explanation was that shell shock resulted from poisoning by the carbon monoxide formed by explosions.

At the same time, an alternative view developed describing shell shock as an emotional, rather than a physical, injury. Evidence for this point of view was provided by the fact that an increasing proportion of men with shell shock symptoms had not been exposed to artillery fire. Since the symptoms appeared in men who had no proximity to an exploding shell, the physical explanation was clearly unsatisfactory.

In spite of this evidence, the British Army continued to try to differentiate those whose symptoms followed explosive exposure from others. In 1915 the British Army in France was instructed that:

However, it often proved difficult to identify which cases were which, as the information on whether a casualty had been close to a shell explosion or not was rarely provided.

Management

Acute
At first, shell-shock casualties were rapidly evacuated from the front line – in part because of fear of their unpredictable behaviour. As the size of the British Expeditionary Force increased, and manpower became in shorter supply, the number of shell shock cases became a growing problem for the military authorities. At the Battle of the Somme in 1916, as many as 40% of casualties were shell-shocked, resulting in concern about an epidemic of psychiatric casualties, which could not be afforded in either military or financial terms.

Among the consequences of this were an increasing official preference for the psychological interpretation of shell shock, and a deliberate attempt to avoid the medicalisation of shell shock. If men were 'uninjured' it was easier to return them to the front to continue fighting. Another consequence was an increasing amount of time and effort devoted to understanding and treating shell shock symptoms. Soldiers who returned with shell shock generally could not remember much because their brain would shut out all the traumatic memories.

By the Battle of Passchendaele in 1917, the British Army had developed methods to reduce shell shock. A man who began to show shell-shock symptoms was best given a few days' rest by his local medical officer. Col. Rogers, Regimental Medical Officer,  4th Battalion Black Watch wrote:

If symptoms persisted after a few weeks at a local Casualty Clearing Station, which would normally be close enough to the front line to hear artillery fire, a casualty might be evacuated to one of four dedicated psychiatric centres which had been set up further behind the lines, and were labelled as ""NYDN – Not Yet Diagnosed Nervous"" pending further investigation by medical specialists.

Although the Battle of Passchendaele generally became a byword for horror, the number of cases of shell shock were relatively few. 5,346 shell shock cases reached the Casualty Clearing Station, or roughly 1% of the British forces engaged. 3,963 (or just under 75%) of these men returned to active service without being referred to a hospital for specialist treatment. The number of shell shock cases reduced throughout the battle, and the epidemic of illness was ended.

During 1917, ""shell shock"" was entirely banned as a diagnosis in the British Army, and mentions of it were censored, even in medical journals.

Chronic treatment
The treatment of chronic shell shock varied widely according to the details of the symptoms, the views of the doctors involved, and other factors including the rank and class of the patient.

There were so many officers and men with shell shock that 19 British military hospitals were wholly devoted to the treatment of cases. Ten years after the war, 65,000 veterans of the war were still receiving treatment for it in Britain. In France it was possible to visit aged shell shock victims in hospital in 1960.

Physical causes
2015 research by Johns Hopkins University has found that the brain tissue of combat veterans who have been exposed to improvised explosive devices (IEDs) exhibit a pattern of injury in the areas responsible for decision making, memory and reasoning.  This evidence has led the researchers to conclude that shell shock may not only be a psychological disorder, since the symptoms exhibited by affected individuals from the First World War are very similar to these injuries. Immense pressure changes are involved in shell shock. Even mild changes in air pressure from weather have been linked to changes in behavior.

There is also evidence to suggest that the type of warfare faced by soldiers would affect the probability of shell shock symptoms developing. First-hand reports from medical doctors at the time note that rates of such conditions decreased once the war was mobilized again during the 1918 German offensive, following the 1916-1917 period where the highest rates of shell shock can be found.  This could suggest that it was trench warfare, and the experience of siege warfare specifically, that led to the development of these symptoms.

Cowardice

Some men with shell shock were put on trial, and even executed, for military crimes including desertion and cowardice.  While it was recognised that the stresses of war could cause men to break down, a lasting episode was likely to be seen as symptomatic of an underlying lack of character. For instance, in his testimony to the post-war Royal Commission examining shell shock, Lord Gort said that shell shock was a weakness and was not found in ""good"" units. The continued pressure to avoid medical recognition of shell shock meant that it was not, in itself, considered an admissible defence. Although some doctors or medics did take procedure to try to cure soldiers' shell shock, it was first done in a brutal way. Doctors would provide electric shock to soldiers in hopes that it would shock them back to their normal, heroic, pre-war self. After almost a year of giving one of his patients electric shocks, putting cigarettes on his tongue, hot plates at the back of his throat, etc., a British clinician, Lewis Yealland, said to his patient, ""You will not leave this room until you are talking as well as you ever did... You must behave as the hero I expected you to be.""

Executions of soldiers in the British Army were not commonplace. While there were 240,000 Courts Martial and 3080 death sentences handed down, in only 346 cases was the sentence carried out. 266 British soldiers were executed for ""Desertion"", 18 for ""Cowardice"", 7 for ""Quitting a post without authority"", 5 for ""Disobedience to a lawful command"" and 2 for ""Casting away arms"".  On 7 November 2006, the government of the United Kingdom gave them all a posthumous conditional pardon.

Commission of enquiry 
The British government produced a Report of the War Office Committee of Enquiry into ""Shell-Shock"" which was published in 1922. Recommendations from this included:

Part of the concern was that many British veterans were receiving pensions and had long-term disabilities.

War correspondent Philip Gibbs wrote:

One British writer between the wars wrote:

Development of psychiatry
At the beginning of World War II, the term ""shell shock"" was banned by the British Army, though the phrase ""postconcussional syndrome"" was used to describe similar traumatic responses.

Society and culture
Shell shock has had a profound impact in British culture and the popular memory of World War I. At the time, war writers like the poets Siegfried Sassoon and Wilfred Owen dealt with shell shock in their work. Sassoon and Owen spent time at Craiglockhart War Hospital, which treated shell shock casualties. Author Pat Barker explored the causes and effects of shell shock in her Regeneration Trilogy, basing many of her characters on real historical figures and drawing on the writings of the first world war poets and the army doctor W. H. R. Rivers.

Modern cases of shell shock 
Although the term ""shell shocked"" is typically used in discussion of WWI to describe early forms of PTSD, its high-impact explosives-related nature provides modern applications as well. During their deployment in Iraq and Afghanistan, approximately 380,000 U.S. troops, about 19% of those deployed, were estimated to have sustained brain injuries from explosive weapons and devices. This prompted the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to open up a $10 million study of the blast effects on the human brain. The study revealed that, while the brain remains initially intact immediately after low level blast effects, the chronic inflammation afterwards is what ultimately leads to many cases of shell shock and PTSD.

Created as a military formation of the PDPA's standing army, it degraded into a grouping of militias by its last years.

Abdul Rashid Dostum had previously commanded the Jozjani militia, which later became the 53rd Infantry Division. Numbering 40,000 men drawn from the Uzbek minority, it took its orders directly from Mohammad Najibullah. It was later termed as the 'only real mobile reserve' available to the regime. After 1989, this force was the only one capable of carrying out offensive operations.

The 80th Division was reportedly formed during the Soviet–Afghan War, after 1988. It was originally an Isma'ili-sponsored tribal Sarandoy (Interior Ministry) regiment/brigade. In 1989 it was the major formation in Baghlan Province, under the command of Sayed Jafar Naderi, the then 25-year-old son of Sayed Mansoor Naderi, 53, the religious leader of the minor Isma`ili Islamic sect in Afghanistan. Inhabiting the areas along or adjacent to the main road leading north from the Salang Tunnel, the cooperation of the Isma'ilis became indispensable to the PDPA regime so as to guarantee the security of convoys moving southwards to Kabul.

The corps was reportedly formed in 1990. General Khodaidad reportedly became chief of staff of the corps and commander of the 54th Division that year. On 18 April 1992, Kunduz, the corps headquarters, was surrendered to the Mujahideen. The corps consisted at the time of the 20th Division, 54th Division, and 80th Division (Kiligai?), and the city hosted the corps headquarters and the 54th Division headquarters. The divisional commander of 54th Division, an ethnic Pashtun, handed over the divisional base complete to the Ittehad-e-Islami leader in the Kunduz area, commander Amir Chughay. Most of the units of the corps came under the sway of Abdul Rashid Dostum's Juneshi-i-Mili Islami, or National Islamic Movement of Afghanistan.

Junbesh-i-Islami soon had a force of five divisions (the corps' three plus the 19th and 53rd Division) several independent brigades (including the 510th and 511th) and militia formations, plus police and armed units belonging to the national security (WAD). The force was theoretically 120,000 men strong, equipped with large amounts of armour and artillery, spread across seven of Afghanistan's provinces, from Maimana, to Sheberghan, home of the 53rd Division, to Pul-i-Khumri in the east. The actual total of full-time troops probably stood at around half that number.

By mid-1994 there were two parallel 6th Corps operating in the north. Dostum's 6th Corps was based at Pul-i-Khumri and had three divisions: the 20th Division (Bagh-i-Momtaz, south of Baghlan), the 54th Division (Samangan), and the 80th Division (Qilagai/Kiligai), controlled by the Naderi clan that presides over the Ismaeli. The Defence Ministry of the Kabul government's 6th Corps was based at Kunduz and also had three divisions, two sharing numbers with formations in Dostum's corps. 
Davis in JIR 1994 lists the 20th, 54th, 55th and Bakakhstan Divisions.

The 29th AMF Division was reported as responsible for the nine eastern districts of Badakhshan and was a part of Dostum's 6th Corps in Kunduz.

Brigadier General Mohammed Daoud Andrabi Khan became corps commander and was reportedly the most powerful man in Kunduz province. Daoud was a former deputy to Masoud, is Tajik, and was a member of Jamiat-i-Islami.

An arms collection effort was initiated in late November and early December 2001 by General Atiqullah Bariyalai, who briefly headed the 6th Army Corps before becoming deputy defence minister in 2002. The International Crisis Group describes this effort as 'coordinated and partially successful,' implemented by 'a commission composed of the deputies of the corps commander, division chiefs, police chiefs, and governors in all four northeastern provinces'.

Daoud was made deputy interior minister of narcotics affairs on August 16, 2004.

One report has the corps disbanding in 2003.

Ballou was born and raised in Liverpool, New York, a suburb of Syracuse. His father was Leslie G. Ballou, and he had a brother, James.

After a stint as an electronics technician at Western Electric in Syracuse, Ballou began his radio career as disc jockey at WOLF in 1962. With Ballou's help WOLF enjoyed a majority share of Syracuse radio listeners in 1963 and 1964. In 1964 he moved to WNDR radio. He also hosted a black-and-white television version of ""The Bud Ballou Show"" on WNYS-TV, channel 9, originating from the station's Shoppingtown studios in DeWitt, which premiered on February 8, 1965.

Ballou left the Syracuse area for KBTR in Denver, Colorado in 1966, and in 1967 he moved to WKBW in Buffalo, New York to replace Joey Reynolds. As an April Fool's Day stunt in 1967, Ballou hosted one shift on WPOP, trading places with another DJ for that day only.

Ballou moved to the Boston area in 1968 appearing on WMEX until 1971 and then moving to WVBF in Framingham until 1976. During this period he was an avid hockey fan who sometimes watched games even while broadcasting.

Ballou died April 15, 1977 at age 34 of a massive stroke at Leonard Morse Hospital in South Natick. He is buried in Fulton, New York. He was married to the former Kasia Rondomanski of Fulton and had four children.

Confusingly, a different ex-WOLF disc jockey from the Syracuse area named Howie Castle used ""Bud Ballou"" as his professional name while working for Radio Caroline in Europe in late-1967 and early-1968. As of 2002, Castle was the news anchor at KOGO in San Diego.

Career

Sunderland
Born in Sunderland, Tyne and Wear, Proctor started his career with his hometown club Sunderland in their youth system and signed a professional contract with them on 29 October 1997. He made his first team debut for Sunderland against Everton in the League Cup on 11 November 1998, which finished as a 1–1 draw. He was loaned to Danish side Hvidovre in 2000 to recuperate from a cruciate ligament injury. He joined Halifax Town on loan in March 2001, making his debut against Cheltenham Town, in which he scored in a 4–2 win. He finished this loan spell with four goals in 12 appearances. He played at York City on loan during the 2001–02 season, making his debut in a 1–0 defeat against Rushden & Diamonds. He finished this spell with 49 appearances and 14 goals, making him York's top scorer for the season. He joined Bradford City on loan in August 2002. He scored the winning goal on his debut as Bradford defeated Ipswich Town 2–1, and became a favourite among fans, players, and the board. He scored a total of four goals in 12 games during his two-month spell, including a late equaliser as nine-man City drew 2–2 with Burnley, but he returned to Sunderland when manager Howard Wilkinson blocked another month's extension to the loan.

He scored the winner for Sunderland in their 2–1 win over Liverpool on 15 December 2002. One unfortunate claim to fame occurred whilst playing for Sunderland in 2003, in a 3–1 defeat to Charlton Athletic, where Proctor scored two own goals within just five minutes.

Rotherham United and Hartlepool United
Proctor left Sunderland in February 2004, joining Rotherham United in a swap deal for Darren Byfield. He joined Swindon Town on a month's loan deal in February 2005. Swindon could not afford to extend his loan at the club and he returned to Rotherham in March. He later moved to Hartlepool United on a free transfer in July 2005. He was best remembered by Hartlepool fans for scoring twice in a 3–1 over local rivals Darlington in a League Cup tie early in his Pools' career. He played just 32 games in two seasons for Hartlepool, scoring ten goals, before he was one of ten players released by Danny Wilson.

Wrexham
Proctor joined League Two club Wrexham on a month's loan in March 2007. This loan was extended until the end of the 2006–07 season in April. During this spell he scored two vital goals for Wrexham in their eventually successful survival bid. These were the winning goal in the 1–0 victory at local rivals Shrewsbury Town and the third goal in the Welsh club's 3–1 victory over Boston United which preserved the club's Football League status. He was released by Hartlepool in May 2007 and expressed an interest in joining Wrexham permanently. This move was confirmed in May 2007. He was transfer listed by Wrexham in May 2008 following the club's relegation to the Football Conference, despite finishing the season as the club's top scorer with 12 goals. In the summer of 2009 after talks with manager Dean Saunders, Proctor left the club by mutual consent.

Media Work

From the start of the 2014/15 season, Michael began to work as a co-host for Sun FM's Into The Light football show, discussing all things Sunderland with the duo of Stephen Goldsmith and Gareth Barker of the Wise Men Say podcast; Proctor added expert opinion to the comments of Goldsmith and Barker. This isn't an area of work Michael had intentionally planned on getting into after retiring, as he had previously been involved in coaching at East Durham College. Since becoming a frequent visitor to the Stadium of Light to undergo his media duties, Michael has begun to work closer with the Sunderland media team, most notably interviewing Jermain Defoe about his winning goal in a game against fierce rivals Newcastle United.

History
Radharc was Ireland's first independent television production company, filming their first television documentary in 1961. Primarily run by Catholic priests, the film company  produced a religious programme, titled Radharc, which was broadcast on RTÉ Television for 35 years. The company made programmes until the death of founder Fr Joe Dunn in 1996.

From 1997, the focus of the Radharc Trust changed from producing new programming to a ""mandate to preserve and promote both the substance of the programmes and the values they championed"". The Radharc Archive was set up and overseen by the Radharc Trust, with the physical resources in the collection held by the Irish Film Institute and the RTÉ Archives. The archive contains over 400 documentary films, recorded over several decades, as well as associated documentation, research materials and correspondence.

A 2013 programme, The Radharc Squad, which included footage provided by the archive, won the ""Best Current Affairs/Factual Programme"" award at the 10th Irish Film & Television Awards.

The Radharc Trust also hosts the biennial Radharc Awards. Founded in 2002, these awards are given to the producers of documentary films which reflect the ""spirit of Radharc"" and deal with social justice, morality or faith-related topics.

The building topped out in 2016, and construction ended in 2018.

History
The city first approved plans for the building in 2007. HFZ announced Chipperfield's role as architect in 2015, in the same press release that disclosed the development's name. The announcement also disclosed that the building would have both condominiums and a luxury hotel. The site formerly held a parking lot, and constituted the final undeveloped plot on Bryant Park.

The developers of the nearby Bryant Park Hotel sued HFZ over the use of the name ""The Bryant"".

Architecture
HFZ solicited plans from architectural firms including Morris Adjmi and Spivak Architects before settling on Chipperfield. The facade is made of precast, polished concrete, a choice Chipperfield made so that the structure would be aesthetically distinguished from new construction that employs glass as its facade. The New York Times referred to the facade as ""[...] a touch that promises to make the building stand out"". The precast material features marble and sandstone chips in various colors. The colors of the inserted materials reference nearby buildings. Chipperfield's firm also designed the interior, which features herringbone floors. The facade extends into the building's residences.

Though The Bryant is Chipperfield's first ground-up commission in New York, he previously designed the interior of the Bryant Park Hotel, inside the American Radiator Building, which neighbors The Bryant.

Subspecies
Subspecies within this species are not clearly distinguishable and are described on a geographical base. They include:
 Tricolia pullus azorica (Dautzenberg, 1889)
 Tricolia pullus canarica Nordsieck, 1973
 Tricolia pullus picta (da Costa, 1778) (synonyms: Phasianella pullus picta (da Costa, 1778); Tricolia picta (da Costa, 1778) )
 Tricolia pullus pullus (Linnaeus, 1758) (synonym: Turbo pullus pullus Linnaeus, 1758)

Description
The size of the plump, oval shell varies between 3 mm and 11 mm. The shell has five or six rounded, gently convex whorls with a smooth structure, the body whorl being the largest.  The shell has a short, abrupt spire. There is no distinct umbilicus. The aperture is roundish oval with a conspicuous operculum is thick and has a white calcareous surface.  The colour pattern of the shiny shell is very variable and goes from cream to white with pink or purple-brown spots spirally distributed in zigzag or flamed patterns.

The adults are gonochoristic, i.e. consisting of distinct males and females. The ova are released in the sea and fertilized externally.

Distribution
This species is distributed in European waters, the Mediterranean Sea, the Sea of Azov, in the Atlantic Ocean along the Canaries and in the Indian Ocean along Madagascar. It is found in the sublittoral zone and deeper waters (up to 35 m) in often abundant numbers on red seaweeds (Laurencia, Lomentaria, Mastocarpus), collecting diatoms and detritus.

Features
While originally unpopular with train crews stationed there because of its relative isolation and limited shopping and education facilities, these drawbacks were offset by a daily financial allowance and an extra day of paid leave for every month served there by railwqy workers.  In the modern day though, Dete has grown into a full community.

There are three main suburbs. The largest two are the densely populated Mtuya and Soweto. Mtuya is made up of predominantly mud houses with thatch roofs, while Soweto is composed of brick houses with asbestos roofing. Soweto and the smaller Bote were electrified under the government's R.E.P in 2012. The smaller and less densely populated suburb is the 'Railways' suburb, originally built by the railways for its workers, but now inhabited by a mixture of the wealthier Dete inhabitants.

Residents of Dete are used to seeing wild game visit their houses and backyards. Over the years, animals have made good to stay away from residential areas lest they be prey for poachers, save for elephants that still terrorise the area. For visitors, Dete offers easy access to Hwange Main Camp, a popular entry point to the Hwange National Park. There is also access to the local Detema Safari Lodge, as well as the Hwange Safari Lodge. Detema Safari Lodge was burnt down in 2011 in a case of a wildfire and what remains is a ruin. There is New Game Reserve Hotel which is located at the Dete shopping centre and Miombo Lodge some three kilometres east of the shopping centre.

There are two primary schools, Sir Roy Welensky School, Dete (located within the Railway suburb, and St Francis Xavier School, Dete (a Catholic school). There is a local day secondary school called Detema Secondary School, as well as the Marist Brothers Secondary School (established 1972), located five kilometers from Dete town.

Dete is near the Kamativi tin mine and its economy depends on that and small grocery shops that serve the community.  The majority of income earners are civil servants, while the major portion of residents subsist on urban agriculture, i.e. small plots.

Train system
Bulawayo-based train crews booked off on arrival at Dete, while Dete or Hwange train crews worked the train further north to Hwange.

This system of trains working was phased out when diesel locomotives were introduced on the Bulawayo-Victoria Falls railway line.

History
MDA was formed on 1 January 2003 by the merger of Singapore Broadcasting Authority (SBA), the Films and Publications Department (FPD) and the Singapore Film Commission (SFC), in response to a national call to develop a globally competitive media industry in Singapore.  An industry blueprint called Media 21 was also drawn up and eventually endorsed by the 2002 Economic Review Committee (chaired by then Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong) –  as part of the Creative Industries Development Strategy to propel the growth of Singapore’s creative economy.

On 18 January 2016, Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI) announced that the Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore (IDA) and MDA will be restructured into two new entities: The Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) and the Government Technology Organisation (GTO), in the second half of 2016.

Preceding statutory boards

Singapore Broadcasting Authority
Prior to the merger, SBA, which was formed on 1 October 1994 under the purview of the previous Ministry of Information and the Arts (MITA), was set up to regulate the broadcasting industry in Singapore.

Films and Publications Department
FPD was set up as a department under the then MITA to regulate the content of films and publications on 1 January 1998. The Board of Film Censors was a part of the FPD, responsible for classification of films and videos.

Singapore Film Commission
Following the footsteps of film promotion in other countries, SFC was established on 15 April 1998. Following the release of the recommendations under Media 21, SFC was merged under the MDA in 2003.

Roles of MDA
The Media Development Authority is responsible for  promoting and regulating the Singapore media sector. MDA’s function is to grow the media industry by stimulating job creation, seeding and attracting investments, while  setting standards that  lay the foundation for building a cohesive and inclusive society.

Industry Developer
One of MDA’s key initiatives is to develop industry roadmaps that position Singapore as the nucleus where media content, services and applications are financed, made and traded for the world. Media 21 was the first roadmap established by MDA in 2003 in response to global media convergence. More recently,   the Singapore Media Fusion Plan (SMFP), a national media development blueprint, was launched in 2009  to  s create the best environment in Singapore for media businesses to exploit new opportunities in digital media and move up the value chain, while enhancing the global appeal of Singapore media through international partnerships.

In 2011, MDA also revised its funding schemes. In 2013, it has five main schemes namely Production Assistance, Development Assistance, Marketing Assistance, Talent Assistance and Enterprise Assistance to help support different stages of a project. These schemes are applicable to projects across various sectors such as Film, Animation, Interactive media, Games, Publishing, Broadcast and Music.

Next-Generation Media Regulator
Another key responsibility of MDA is to create and enforce regulatory policies that make Singapore an attractive place to encourage investment and innovation in the media sector, leading to more choices for consumers.

Since the 1990s (under the purview of SBA) until now, it see itself leading the charge to address the latest challenges and opportunities faced by the media industry posed by media convergence and a digital media era through convergence regulation. For example, it was the first to articulate Internet policies and establish Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB) standards in Southeast Asia.

Its regulatory approach gradually shifted towards industry co-regulation and consultation to stimulate industry growth and yet serve the public interest for a maximum number of households in Singapore. Their focus appears to be to design policy frameworks that facilitate industry growth, whilst enabling informed choices and protecting the young from undesirable content.

A key challenge for the regulator is how to ensure its policies keep in-step with community values to bring about community-led content standards, whilst providing an excellent level of customer responsiveness to customers. Recent examples include the introduction of new ratings under their content classification standards (e.g. PG13), and previously SBA’s Class Licence Scheme.

Like regulators in developed countries like Australia and the UK, MDA works with other public agencies and various community groups to raise media literacy standards through public education initiatives to nurture a media savvy and connected society. MDA has initiated programmes that help to cultivate critical media awareness skills and cyber wellness values.

Criticism
Restrictions on freedom of speech and assembly are enforced by MDA.

In 2005, the MDA withheld the licence for Benny Lim's play Human Lefts unless some scenes were edited and all references to the death penalty removed. The play was originally written about the hanging of Shanmugam Murugesu and was to have been staged one day after the controversial execution of Australian national Nguyen Tuong Van. In August 2006, a play Smegma was banned by the MDA which said that ""the play portrays Muslims in a negative light.""

In May 2013, the MDA announced its new compulsory license scheme for news websites with significant reach that report Singapore news. These sites must put up a performance bond of S$50,000 and are expected to remove content that is in breach of MDA standards within 24 hours, once notified to do so. This move was heavily criticised by more than 20 activists and bloggers who pointed out that the scheme would impact citizens’ ability to ""receive diverse news information"".

In May 2014, 45 major arts groups released a paper strongly objecting to MDA's proposed optional scheme to train arts practitioners as ""content assessors"" to ensure compliance with the authority's classification guidelines. Such practitioners whose groups' ""content assessors"" mis-classify performances would face a fine of up to $5,000, and may have their licences revoked. The arts groups rejected such ""co-regulation"" as promoting self-censorship.

On 10 September 2014, Tan Pin Pin's award-winning documentary To Singapore, With Love was banned in Singapore, with the MDA claiming that it undermined national security as ""the individuals in the film have given distorted and untruthful accounts of how they came to leave Singapore and remain outside Singapore,"" and that ""a number of these self-professed 'exiles' were members of, or had provided support to, the proscribed Communist Party of Malaya (CPM)."" In response, a group of 39 artists, including filmmakers Anthony Chen, Royston Tan and Kelvin Tong, released a joint statement expressing ""deep disappointment"" and urged the MDA to reverse the ban. On 2 October 2014, Tan submitted To Singapore, With Love, unchanged, to the MDA's Film Appeals Committee to review the film's ban. In a statement, Tan wrote, ""As we approach our 50th birthday, I feel that we as a people should be able to view and weigh for ourselves, through legitimate public screenings in Singapore, differing views about our past, even views that the government disagrees with. I hope that Film Appeals Committee will see the film and review the classification in this light."" On 12 November 2014, Tan's review was denied. In a statement, the chairman of the Film Appeals Committee (FAC) said, ""While of commendable artistic standard, the FAC found the film to be a one-sided account with minimal attempts to provide a balanced mix of views beyond those provided by the interviewees featured in the film"". Of the 12 FAC members present, nine voted to uphold the classification while the other three voted that the film be given a Restricted 21 (R21) rating instead.

In June 2016, the MDA objected to 31 photographs in Iranian photojournalist Newsha Tavakolian's I Know Why the Rebel Sings exhibition, as part of the Singapore International Festival of Arts pre-festival The O.P.E.N. programme, as they featured ""female kurdish members from a terrorist-linked organisation, who had committed acts of violence to further their cause, for example suicide bombing."" 15 of these photographs made it to the final cut of the exhibition and were disallowed. Festival director Ong Keng Sen issued a statement condemning MDA's explanation and pointing out that the photographs were already published in the readily accessible Time magazine, both online and off. He also pointed out the photos depicted the kurdish soldiers fighting ISIS, a greater evil. ""And so we are living with a new terror where we don’t know, it is out of our control,"" he said at the exhibition's launch.

About the band
Suspyre's sound is heavily influenced by a wide variety of bands and composers, most prominently Dream Theater, Opeth, Symphony X, Mahler, Stravinsky, Mozart and Bach.

In the summer of 2001 drummer Chris Myers hosted a jam session at his house with guitarists Gregg Rossetti and Rich Skibinsky. Kevin O'Hara, a singer whose musical interests are as varied as The Backstreet Boys and medieval music, was asked to be the singer. His debut performance was a metal version of ""The Star-Spangled Banner,"" America's National Anthem. Gregg left for college in August of that year, while Rich and Chris were still in high school.

When Suspyre started working on their first album, it was apparent that the direction of the music was beyond the capabilities of some of the members, and to realize the vision, changes were necessary.   First, Chris Myers was replaced by Sam Paulicelli, then Raffaele Gerace was replaced by Clay Barton.

Their debut record, ""The Silvery Image"" was released in October 2005.  Twelve tracks, with a total run time of 56:36, the album has elements of progressive rock, power metal, and classical music. The music showcases many different styles, including featuring a saxophone in select songs.  The album was re-mastered and reissued in February 2008, with a new  song called ""Crimson Shade"", written in February, 2004 predating the recording of ""The Silvery Image.""

Response to that initial album was strong. To follow that, the band sought to maintain the momentum on the next record, ""A Great Divide"". The first half, The Alignment of Galaxies was composed in August 2005, while The Silvery Image was still in its final stages of completion. The second half, The Origin of a Curse was composed in November 2005, when the band decided a full-length was a better idea than just releasing the first half as an EP. During this time Suspyre parted with bassist Kirk Schwenkler. Noah Martin from Atlanta, Georgia was hired to record the album. The permanent replacement for Kirk is now Andrew Distabile, a friend of the band whom actually switched from guitar to bass in order to play.

2007
""A Great Divide"" was released on March 20, 2007 through Nightmare Records, Suspyre's first release on that label.  The album release was delayed because of trouble getting the album art. This effort was more diverse in every sense of the word: long, complicated passages are offset by simpler and shorter pieces; straightforward rhythms super-imposed with odd time meters; and the use of microtonal clusters. The album reached the top 2007 prog metal album charts on websites such as USA Progressive Music, ProgPalaceRadio.com, and Beyond Ear Candy.  To help promote the album, Suspyre participated in the Chicago PowerFest 2007, in Mokena, Illinois. After the Chicago Powerfest performance, Sam Paulicelli left the band to pursue other opportunities, eventually joining the black metal band, Abigail Williams.

2008
The band finished recording their third album, When Time Fades..., released on Sensory Records on September 30, 2008.  Suspyre played with Odin's Court and Dark Empire for two east coast shows the first weekend of August. On August 2, 2008, they announced that April Sese joined the band as their new keyboardist.

Suspyre put on a CD release Performance/Party with special guest drummer Charlie Zeleny on September 20, 2008 to promote the new album, and traveled to the Netherlands for the ProgPower Europe festival in October 2008 with Zeleny as well.

2009
In January 2009, co-founder/guitarist Rich Skibinsky left the band to pursue other opportunities, later joining the punk rock band Kelsey & The Chaos.  In February 2009, Suspyre announced a new drummer, Gabe Marshall.

In June 2009, bassist Andrew Distabile replaced Skibinsky on guitar. Sam Bhoot joined the band on bass for their debut performance at The Art of Prog Series at the North Star Bar in Philadelphia on July 26, 2009, and the ProgPower USA showcase in Atlanta, GA on September 10, 2009.

The transformed sequence is computed by an ""addition"" operation, implemented as if filling a triangular array in a boustrophedon (zigzag- or serpentine-like) manner—as opposed to a ""Raster Scan"" sawtooth-like manner.

Definition

The boustrophedon transform is a numerical, sequence-generating transformation, which is determined by an ""addition"" operation.

Generally speaking, given a sequence: , the boustrophedon transform yields another sequence: , where  is likely defined equivalent to . The entirety of the transformation itself can be visualized (or imagined) as being constructed by filling-out the triangle as shown in Figure 1.

Boustrophedon Triangle 

To fill-out the numerical Isosceles triangle (Figure 1), you start with the input sequence, , and place one value (from the input sequence) per row, using the boustrophedon scan (zigzag- or serpentine-like) approach.

The top vertex of the triangle will be the input value , equivalent to output value , and we number this top row as row 0.

The subsequent rows (going down to the base of the triangle) are numbered consecutively (from 0) as integers—let  denote the number of the row currently being filled. These rows are constructed according to the row number () as follows:
 For all rows, numbered , there will be exactly  values in the row.
 If  is odd, then put the value  on the right-hand end of the row.
 Fill-out the interior of this row from right-to-left, where each value (index: ) is the result of ""addition"" between the value to right (index: ) and the value to the upper right (index: ).
 The output value  will be on the left-hand end of an odd row (where  is odd).
 If  is even, then put the input value  on the left-hand end of the row.
 Fill-out the interior of this row from left-to-right, where each value (index: ) is the result of ""addition"" between the value to its left (index: ) and the value to its upper left (index: ).
 The output value  will be on the right-hand end of an even row (where  is even).

Refer to the arrows in Figure 1 for a visual representation of these ""addition"" operations.

For a given, finite input-sequence: , of  values, there will be exactly  rows in the triangle, such that  is an integer in the range:  (exclusive). In other words, the last row is .

Recurrence relation

A more formal definition uses a recurrence relation. Define the numbers  (with k ≥ n ≥ 0) by

.

Then the transformed sequence is defined by  (for  and greater indices).

Per this definition, note the following definitions for values outside the restrictions (from the relationship above) on  pairs:

Special Cases 
In the case a0 = 1, an = 0 (n > 0), the resulting triangle is called the Seidel–Entringer–Arnold Triangle and the numbers  are called Entringer numbers .

In this case the numbers in the transformed sequence bn are called the Euler up/down numbers. This is sequence A000111 on the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences. These enumerate the number of alternating permutations on n letters and are related to the Euler numbers and the Bernoulli numbers.

Algebraic definition(s) 

Building from the geometric design of the boustrophedon transform, algebraic definitions of the relationship from input values () to output values () can be defined for different algebras (""numeric domains"").

Euclidean (Real) values 

In the Euclidean () Algebra for Real ()-valued scalars, the boustrophedon transformed Real-value  is related to the input value, , as:

,

with the reverse relationship (input from output) defined as:

,

where  is the sequence of ""up/down"" numbers—also known as secant or tangent numbers.

The exponential generating function

The exponential generating function of a sequence (an) is defined by

The exponential generating function of the boustrophedon transform (bn) is related to that of the original sequence (an) by

The exponential generating function of the unit sequence is 1, so that of the up/down numbers is sec x + tan x.

At one time Versailles called itself ""Poultry Capital of the World"". The festival began officially in 1951 (and possibly earlier) as a one-day community picnic, and has evolved into a three-day festival.

The Village of Versailles holds the festival annually at Versailles High School where a giant ""Beer Tent"" is erected on one of the main arteries into the village.  Rides, parades and contests are held, including the ""Miss Chick"" contest for high school age young ladies and a ""Little Miss Poultry Days"" contest for girls ages 4–6.  More than 25,000 ""World Famous Poultry Days Barbecue Chicken Dinners"" are served. The 1967 festival was noted for the creation of a gigantic omelette cooked with 90 dozen eggs.

The 3-day festival also includes one of the world's largest Ultimate tournaments, the Jeff Warrick Poultry Days Ultimate Classic. Dale Wilker and his friends started the tournament with just two teams, in honor of  and it has now grown to include dozens of teams from the United States and internationally.

In 1983 George Wendt (""Norm Peterson"" from Cheers) came to Versailles to act as the Honorary Festival Leader. He came to thank Don Wick, a Versailles High School counselor who successfully created a campaign to save Cheers from being canceled after its first season. After his duties as Festival Leader were over, Wendt went around to the local bars and drank with the patrons.

History
Poultry Days Festival began as a single day event held on a Thursday and referred to as Poultry Day. This first festival was small and community focused but grew quickly drawing visitors from surrounding communities and from as far as Dayton. In 1962, the Day was expanded to a two-day event on Wednesday and Thursday. In 1966, the festival was moved again making it a weekend event held on Friday and Saturday. In 1969, expansion included the now ever-present carnival rides. Finally, in 1972, the annual Poultry Days Festival was expanded to a three-day event on held on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. Poultry Days has settled into being held on the second full weekend in June.

The selection of foods available at the festival has evolved, and throughout the years choices included an egg smorgasbord, turkey and noodles, turkey burgers, and deviled eggs. In 1974, barbequed chicken was finally served throughout the entire festival. The first dinners cost $1.25 and included half a chicken, a roll, butter, chips, cranberry salad, pickles and a choice of coffee or pop.

In 1952 it took approximately 125 volunteers to construct and operate the BBQ pits. By 1970, chicken dinners had outgrown the capacity of local volunteers so a partnership began with Nelson's BBQ (formerly known as Port-A-Pit). This partnership continues with the third generation of the Nelson family providing chicken for Poultry Days, which remains their single largest annual event.

The early chicken serving lines were run by “The Ladies Serving Committee,” while the men ran the barbecue pits. A drive-through line was added in 2001. Further enhancements have culminated in a smooth running operation, which in 2014 averaged 1,300 dinners served per hour, with a peak of nearly 2,000 dinners per hour, or a dinner every 2 seconds.

The first “Miss Chick,” Bonnie Sue Besecker (Laura, Ohio), was crowned in 1952 and the festival has continued to recognize vibrant, dynamic, young women. The pageant has drawn as many as 112 contestants from throughout Ohio and beyond, requiring an extensive judging process that begins before the festival. Today the event is limited to young ladies from Darke and surrounding counties. A new tradition was born in 1985 when Trisha Rhoades became the festival's first “Little Miss Poultry Days”.

As early as 1957 or 1958, Colonel Warner Nichols added the Grand Parade which he organized until his death in 1965 at which time John “Red” Elson took over. Red went on to start the successful Antique Car parade in 1973 which is now run by the Dickman Family. In the late 1960s the Versailles Fire Department took over organizing the Grand Parade which has continued for nearly 50 years. Both parades continue today and draw in excess of 100 units annually making them among the largest parades in the region. The honorary Grand Parade Marshall position has been awarded to community leaders who are recognized for their contribution and volunteerism in the community.

In the early 1970s, Poultry Days attempted to break the world record for the largest egg omelet with another attempt in 1982. This culminated in an omelet that measured nearly 9 feet in diameter and required 22,128 eggs, 100 pounds of onions, and 100 pounds of ham that were combined in a concrete mixer. The custom-built omelet pan was an exhibit for many years.

The Ultimate Frisbee Tournament started in 1981.

The Giant Chicken float first made its appearance in the late 80s and was originally purchased by the Versailles Development Association to promote Versailles. Annual chicken painting (on the streets in intersections) started in 1996 to welcome visitors to town and later to designate board members and festival VIPs. The creation of a festival theme began in 1987.

In 1974, the Beer Tent was established as the area's first official social tent serving beer on a closed State Highway. Over the years, festival entertainment has ranged from orchestras to modern bands.

In 1983, a group of Versailles friends organized the first Poultry Days Ultimate Frisbee Championship after the hometown team the Blue Meanies beat the Diamond Dawgs of Dayton in a grudge match the previous year. The annual tournament has grown to become a top tournament and one of three “bucket list” tournaments drawing several thousand players and friends to Versailles each year. Players from around the United States and international teams have made the pilgrimage to Versailles and have experienced a warm welcome from residents and businesses. The event was originally named the Poultry Days Ultimate Tournament but in 1990 it was changed to the Jeff Warrick Poultry Days Ultimate Class after Jeff Warrick and then Dan Goubeaux who succumbed to Leukemia. From this point forward the money raised from the tournament has been donated to the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society of America. This event has developed its own traditions including an egg eating contest for charity and strong connections to the Miss Chick Pageant. The ultimate players vie for Miss Chick to choose them as “Mr. Cluck.”

On July 4, 1985, Poultry Days dedicated Heritage Park. Originally intended to be a new location for the festival, the project evolved into a 40-acre park including ponds, a walking track, shelter houses and sports fields. The park is also home to several thousand Ultimate players each summer. While Poultry Days continues to fund the park, the independent Heritage Park Board was established to oversee and maintain the park. Poultry Days has donated in excess of $700,000 over the past 10 years.

Though Versailles has only 2,687 residents, Poultry Days attracts crowds exceeding 50,000 people over the course of the festival weekend. With a record of 26,101 dinners in 2002, the festival is quickly approaching its one millionth dinner sold.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 in-person festival was canceled but chicken dinners were still available for drive-thru pickup.

They are based in Évreux, Normandy and are currently playing in the Championnat National 3, the fifth tier of the French football league system. They play at the Stade Du 14 Juillet Madeleine in the town.

History

The club's relatively late foundation is as a result of a merger between the two local clubs in the city, Évreux AC and ALM Évreux. The merger was initiated by professional football players Mathieu Bodmer and Bernard Mendy. Both players are from the city of Évreux and started their careers at Évreux AC. The merger was officially announced on 15 June 2009 following a meeting held between both club's official. Mathieu Bodmer was installed as president, but, due to his busy football schedule, agreed to give responsibility of the club to Abdel Bouchelagem, who will manage the club, Eric Fouda, who will be the sporting director, and Ossam Benali, who will handle the club's administrative tasks. Following the merger, the new club was inserted into the Championnat de France Amateur 2, replacing the old club, Évreux AC.

606,"['In developing by working stageed , workers firstly become qualified ( learning by - doing ) so qualified workers pay more than unqualified .']","Developing by working is a concept of regional economic theory. It refers to the capability of workers both to improve their productivity and raise their income as being employed in rural areas by government initiatives. 

The increased productivity is achieved through practice, self-perfection and minor innovations, as mentioned by Kenneth Arrow within the concept of Learning by doing.  Achieving learning by doing stage, they become qualified, they can earn more so their aggregate income grows. When their total incomes grows, they will be able to save more, therefore, benefit extra gains from savings. In developing by working stage, workers firstly become qualified (learning by-doing) so qualified workers paid more than unqualified.

The concept of developing by working has been modeled by Mustafa Cicek, a Turkish economist within his PhD thesis at KTU Trabzon, Turkey, in his design of endogenous and unbalanced regional growth theory to explain the effects of employment of unqualified rural people by government initiatives.

For a developing economy which experiences seriously regional imbalances, the structure of the economy does not allow all people to be employed and all factors to be used in the provinces. To tackle these problems through regionalizing both endogenous and unbalanced growth models, the Endogenous and Unbalanced Regional Growth (EURG) for regional economies has been modeled. In this model, the state is actively participating. 

In addition, the endogenous characteristics of regions are being considered with globalization, postmodernism and new economy. There are three units, first of which are planned for traditional agricultural sector, the second is for modern sector, and the third is for knowledge sector. In the first unit, the unqualified unemployed people are being employed by government initiatives. The backward and forward linkages are created among the regions. The second unit produces modern production. The third unit produces knowledge and knowledge-intensive output which supplies both internal and external markets. The more it sells to external markets, the more both regional and personal income rise. 

Triggered by the employment of regional people, the “developing by working” stage, which goes beyond the learning by doing, can be experienced. As for qualified people, the more they earn, the more they can save, so their aggregate income grows. Therefore, the higher capital and knowledge accumulation leads to boom in regional economy.

The EURG model is being adapted to regions where agricultural sector is dominant to introduce opportunities for growth. To secure optimum production scale, it is advised that planning the agricultural sector be done by taking into consideration territory, quantity and type of yield.

Plot summary
Hibbert, an imprisoned innocent, is caught up in the jailbreak of his cellmate Scarlatti, engineered with the assistance of another man, Burks. Forcing Hibbert to accompany them, Scarlatti and Burks make for the Florida Everglades, picking up Scarlatti's girlfriend Carlotta on the way.

In the Everglades the four encounter a miraculous golden stairway extending into the sky. Ascending, they find a pool defended by a blue flamingo, which is killed by Burks. Another stairway leads them to the land of Khoire, a strange and mysterious paradise. There a man named Patur exposes the true nature of each by means of a crystal mask. He warns them that they will be transformed in accordance with those natures within a day, and must leave Khoire.

Scarlatti and Carlotta's alteration is horrible, and they are consumed by a huge beast; Burks agrees to become a blue flamingo, taking the place of the guardian of the pool, in the hope of some day being readmitted to Khoire. Hibbert is little changed. Returning to the mundane world, he undertakes to find certain persons who can help him gain his own readmittance to Khoire, having fallen in love with one of its denizens, Mareth of the Watchers.

Biography

He was born in Miskolc as the son of an engine driver, Lőrinc Szabó sr., and Ilona Panyiczky. The family moved to Balassagyarmat when he was 3 years old. He attended school in Balassagyarmat and Debrecen. He studied at the ELTE in Budapest where he befriended Mihály Babits. He didn't finish his studies; instead he began to work for the literary periodical Az Est in 1921, shortly after he married Klára Mikes, the daughter of Lajos Mikes. He worked there until 1944. Between 1927 and 1928 he was a founder and editor of the periodical Pandora.

His first published poems appeared in the 1920s in the Nyugat (""The West""). His first book of poetry was published in 1922 under the title Föld, erdő, Isten (""Earth, Forest, God"") and received considerable success. He got the Baumgarten Award in 1932, 1937 and 1943. As a translator, he translated several works of Shakespeare (Timon of Athens in 1935, As You Like It in 1938, Macbeth in 1939, Troilus and Cressida in 1948); Coleridge's Ancient Mariner and Kubla Khan, Baudelaire's Les Fleurs du mal (together with Babits and Árpád Tóth); François Villon's Grand Testament, Molière's L'École des femmes, Goethe's The Sorrows of Young Werther, Thomas Hardy's Tess of the d'Urbervilles, and works of Verlaine, Tyutchev, Pushkin, Krylov, Kleist, Mörike, Nietzsche, George, Rilke, Benn and Weinheber.

He fought in World War II, met Gyula Gömbös and at a literary congress at Lillafüred he emphasized the beauty of war poetry. In 1942 Lőrinc Szabó joined the ""Europäische Schriftstellervereinigung"" (i.e. European Writers' League) which had been founded by Joseph Goebbels. Today his correspondence with its head secretary Carl Rothe shows their close friendship. Szabó became the speaker of Hungarian section of the European Writers' League after József Nyírő and published articles in the organisation's magazine ""Europäische Literatur"" (i.e. European Literature).

This led to him being considered right-wing, and because of this, after the war he was left out of cultural life and could publish only translations, not his own works. His importance was recognised only shortly before his death, when he received the Kossuth Prize. He died of a heart attack.

Poetry
Several of his poems were written to his children Lóci and Klári, while in other poems he remembers his own childhood.

In 1950 his long-time girlfriend Erzsébet Korzáti committed suicide. His sonnet cycle The 26th Year was written in her memory. it was published in 1957.

City of Oakland (or the Riders Case or Riders Scandal) was a civil rights lawsuit in Federal District Court regarding police misconduct in Oakland, California which has resulted in ongoing Federal oversight. Plaintiffs alleged mistreatment at the hands of four veteran officers, known as the ""Riders"", who were alleged to have kidnapped, planted evidence, and beaten citizens. Plaintiffs also alleged that the Oakland Police Department (OPD) turned a blind eye to police misconduct.

The plaintiffs were represented by the Law Offices of John Burris and the Law Offices of James B. Chanin. Ms. Julie Houk, Mr. Chanin's associate, also played a major role in the litigation that has lasted for nearly fourteen years.

In 2003, the parties entered into a settlement. Part of that settlement saw a $10.9 million payout to the 119 plaintiffs. Additionally, the Oakland Police Department was required to comply with a series of reforms. An independent monitoring team was appointed by the court to ensure the police complied with the settlement. As of January 15, 2019, the city has yet to fully comply with the terms of that settlement.

Background
""The Riders"" refer to four officers in the Oakland Police Department.   The Washington Post described them:

At the high point of their careers, the so-called ""Riders"" were considered the best and the brightest, veterans whom rookie police officers tried to emulate. Their specialty: bringing in reputed drug dealers in record numbers from the crime-plagued streets of West Oakland.

The alleged abuses came to light after a rookie officer, just 10 days on the job and fresh out of the police academy, resigned and reported his former co-workers' activities to the police department's Internal Affairs Division.

A string of incidents of police misconduct by the group of four Oakland PD officers known as ""the Oakland Riders"" came to light. 119 people pressed civil rights lawsuits for unlawful beatings and detention, ultimately settling for $11 million with an agreement that the Oakland Police Department would implement significant reforms. Although all of the police officers involved were fired, three were later acquitted of criminal charges while one fled, presumably to Mexico, to avoid prosecution.

Lawsuit
On 17 December 2000, Delphine Allen filed suit against the city. His case was ultimately consolidated along with other similar civil rights lawsuits against Oakland and its police, including a total of 119 different plaintiffs.

In 2003, the city entered into a negotiated settlement agreement. As part of the settlement, the city agreed to pay nearly $11 million to the 119 plaintiffs.

Negotiated settlement
The parties negotiated the largest legal settlement in Oakland municipal history and on March 14, 2003, the district court approved the negotiated settlement agreement.

The settlement brought major changes to police department operations and dealings with the public. The case riveted the city as it was the largest case of police misconduct in Oakland in decades. Despite the settlement's hefty price tag, Russo said the cases could have cost the city tens of millions of dollars more had they gone to trial, pointing out that the victims had spent more than 25 years, combined, imprisoned on false charges. By comparison, Los Angeles spent $40 million to settle litigation stemming from the Rampart corruption scandal.

The payout went to 119 plaintiffs who filed federal civil rights lawsuits claiming four police officers kidnapped, beat and planted drugs on them during the summer of 2000. The plaintiffs alleged that the Oakland Police Department either encouraged or turned a blind eye to the abuse. U.S. District Court Judge Thelton Henderson approved the settlement in the civil cases after 18 months of negotiations.

Post-settlement action

On August 20, 2003, the District Court appointed an independent monitoring team; Rachel Burgess, Kelli Evans, Charles Gruber and Christy Lopez to oversee the reform process and ensure city compliance with the settlement agreement.  In January 2010, a monitoring team led by Robert Warshaw was appointed to replace the team that was appointed in August 2003.

A Jan 17, 2012, report by the independent monitoring team found ""no improvement in compliance"" during the past quarter.  In a January 24, 2012, ruling, the district court found that Oakland Police Department had still failed to comply with the terms of the settlement.

On October 4, 2012, Plaintiffs' counsel filed a motion requesting that the Oakland Police Department be placed in receivership.  The OPD requested more time to achieve compliance.

Plaintiffs' motion ultimately led to a settlement by the parties, who agreed to the Court's appointment of a Compliance Director who would have broad ranging powers, including the power ""to review, investigate and take correction action regarding Oakland Police Department policies, procedures, and practices that are related to the objectives of the Negotiated Settlement Agreement (NSA) and Amended Memorandum of Understanding (AMOU), even if such policies, procedures, or practices do not fall squarely within any specific NSA task."" The Compliance Director was also given the power to remove the Chief of Police, and to demote the Assistant Chief or any of the Deputy Chiefs.
  
The December 12, 2012, Order settling the Plaintiffs' motion also called for the OPD ""to address, resolve, and reduce:  
(1) incidents involving the unjustified use of force, including those involving the drawing and pointing of a firearm at a person or an officer-involved shooting
(2) incidents of racial profiling and bias-based policing
(3) citizen complaints
(4) high-speed pursuits"".

On 10 June 2016, Oakland mayor Libby Schaaf announced the resignation of Oakland PD Chief Sean Whent. Reporters from the East Bay Express reported that Robert Warshaw forced Whent to resign due to the role of Whent (and his wife) in the coverup of a sexual-misconduct scandal involving Oakland police officers (as well as personnel from multiple other agencies) and a minor girl. The reporters also suspect that Whent was motivated by a desire to prevent another scandal from preventing the termination of federal oversight of the department.

Keith Batt, the rookie who first reported the misconduct, ultimately settled with the city for $625,000.

In total, the City of Oakland has paid a total of $57 million during the 2001-2011 timeframe to alleged victims of police abuse—the largest sum of any city in the San Francisco Bay Area.

Criminal proceedings

In November 2000, Alameda county prosecutors filed charges against four members of the Oakland Police Department.  One officer, Francisco ""Frank"" Vazquez, the alleged ringleader, became a fugitive and was not brought to trial.  He is currently wanted by the FBI.

The other three charged officers did stand trial and two juries failed to convict them.  Opening arguments for the first criminal trial began in September 2002. In September 2003, after the longest criminal trial in county history, a jury deadlocked on 27 counts and a mistrial was declared.

The second criminal trial began in November 2004. In May 2005, a jury found officer Matthew Hornung not guilty of all charges.

After two mistrials, the judge dismissed the remaining charges against the two remaining officers.

The wooden monastery, which dates to 1882, is known for its abundance of woodcarvings which depict scenes of the Jataka tales.
The monastery was constructed with 153 teak posts, each more than 3 feet in diameter, which hold the building up about 10 feet above the ground, during the time of King Thibaw. It housed monks from its construction until it was transformed into a museum in 1996.  Aside from the carvings, guests can also view an ancient Buddha image and utensils of Yadanabon 19th century period. Additionally, the museum houses a plethora of unidentified sculptures, a large throne once used by leading monks, as well as an old wooden box that served as carriage for clergy members. Behind the monastery in a small building, work from the famous Burmese playwright and poet, as well as favorite bard in King Mindon's court, U Ponnya, also hailing from the area, are on display.

Constructed in 1920, it was closed when the bank that built it failed in the Great Depression, leaving it to be used by a succession of businesses.  It was occupied by a restaurant, the Ladora Bank Bistro, but that closed down in February 2019. It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since August 3, 1990.

Structure
Designed by William Lightner and Charles B. Zalesky, the masonry Neoclassically styled building included two substantial Doric columns in its facade and several tall windows on the sides. The structure originally included restrooms (including an outside exit for women to use discreetly), which were an unusual feature; at its opening, the bank promoted these restrooms to its customers. Among its interior features visible to the public were marble counters, wooden floors, and paintings on the wall, while massive vaults were built to protect valuables; recent renovations have restored these features, most of which still remain.

History
The Ladora Savings Bank building was dedicated on July 26, 1920. The bank survived the tumultuous economic times of the 1920s, but it could not withstand the Great Depression, which led to its closure on July 27, 1931. The building remained a center of life in Ladora: during various times in its history, it served as a community center, housing a Red Cross office during World War II and a civil defense shelter during the Cold War; it was also a polling place for many years.  It was also a commercial building at certain points in its history, housing at various times an insurance salesman's office, an attorney's office, an antique shop, and a rest area for truck drivers traveling along U.S. 6. During this period, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places, being included primarily for its architecture.

Reopening
After some years of inactivity, the bank building was purchased in October 2004 by businessman Dimitri Makedonsky, who also owns properties around the bank.  Dimitri proceeded to renovate the building: replacing the roof, redesigning the interior, and gradually restoring the interior to an appearance similar to that of a bank from the 1920s.  Hoping to open a restaurant in the building, he refurbished several major side rooms: as the celebrated original restrooms no longer functioned, they were turned into museum rooms, while the bank's substantial vault became a lounge.  The restaurant opened on May 15, 2008. After over a decade of operating as The Ladora Bank Bistro, the building now houses an Iowa Caucus themed bistro named Caucus Bistro.

It stood on the west side of Wood Street, initially with a frontage on Huggin Lane but later on Wood Street itself.

The Medieval church
After King James IV of Scotland was killed at the Battle of Flodden in 1513, his head was brought to London and hastily buried in this church. John Stow admired the building, and called it a ""proper thing"".

Rebuilding
The church was destroyed in the Great Fire of London, and after some pressure it was rebuilt by Sir Christopher Wren in 1673.

The main facade toward Wood Street was described by Godwin as ""a pleasing and well-proportioned morceau of Italian architecture"",  with four Ionic columns above a stylobate, supporting an entablature and pediment. The west side, towards Huggin Lane, was much plainer. The tower was originally 90 ft high; Henry Thomas, writing in 1828, noted that the tower seemed to have survived from the previous building, and that it had recently received a spire, increasing the overall height to 120 feet.

George Godwin described the interior of the church as ""a large and well-lighted parallelogram with a coved ceiling, but ... not ecclesiastical in any respect in its general appearance"". The building was restored in 1831, at which time the tower was opened up into the interior of the church. There was a gallery at the west end and a reredos at the east end, with paintingsof Moses and Aaron.

The organ was  built by Thomas Elliot in 1800: the most noted organist was Dr Henry Hiles.

Demolition
In 1854 the declining residential population led to proposals to reduce the number of churches within the ""Square Mile"" - a procedure the church's vicar had himself proposed. The church was eventually demolished under the auspices of the Union of Benefices Act in 1897, and many bodies were disinterred from the churchyard and reburied at Brookwood Cemetery.

The parish was then united with St Alban Wood Street, and, after the destruction of that church in World War II, with St Vedast Foster Lane.

The site has undergone several redevelopments: as of 2020, it is the site of a low-rise commercial building.

Biography
Nicolai Lomov began playing piano at the age of three. At five, he was enrolled at the Mussorgsky State School for Gifted Children.  Lomov made his musical debut with the Ekaterinburg Philharmonic Orchestra, playing Tchaikovsky's Concerto in B-Flat Minor Op. 23 at 15.

His formative training took place at the Moscow Tchaikovsky State Conservatory, completing his Ph.D in 1971. 
In 1990, leaving behind a teaching position at the St. Petersburg Leningrad State Conservatory, he emigrated to the United States. Seven months later, he found himself in Boston, working as a dishwasher in the Federal Reserve Bank's sixth floor kitchen, while also teaching classes in piano. The documentary Nicolai Lomov, Russian Pianist and American Dishwasher chronicles this story.
After being ""discovered"" while working as a dishwasher, Lomov made his professional US stage debut with the Newton Symphony in Newton, Massachusetts in 1992. From 1992-1996, Lomov was a soloist with the Newton Symphony Orchestra as well as the New Hampshire Philharmonic.

Lomov has performed over 60 recitals in the eastern United States as well as Oklahoma. He taught young pianists in the Rhode Island and New England area. His students have included the pianists Marlon Daniels, Daniel Wnukowski, and Robert Laniewski.

Lomov died on July 24, 2020 at the age of 74 after complications from a stroke.

It was released on September 28, 2004, by Interscope Records. The album was conceived by the band's eponymous vocalist as a ""farewell compilation"", and was originally going to feature a duet with Shirley Manson of Garbage. Upon its completion, neither singer was satisfied with the duet, and it remains unreleased. Instead, the band recorded a cover of Depeche Mode's ""Personal Jesus"" (1989), which became the only new track on the album and was released as a single. The deluxe version of the album included a bonus DVD containing sixteen music videos, one of which was the previously unreleased uncensored version of the music video for ""Saint"" (2004).

Lest We Forget: The Best Of received mostly positive reviews from music critics, several of whom complimented its track listing. The compilation's commercial performance exceeded expectations in the United States, where it sold over 78,000 copies in its first week of release and had sold over a million copies as of late 2010. It was also successful internationally, peaking within the top 10 of national record charts in Austria, Germany, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. The band promoted the album with their ""Against All Gods Tour"".

Background and release

The band's eponymous vocalist conceived Lest We Forget: The Best Of as a ""farewell compilation"", but not a greatest hits album, as ""I was never really a top-40 artist."" Nevertheless, multiple critics classified the record as a greatest hits album. Prior to the album's release, Manson said that he was going to abandon music in favor of becoming a visual artist and pursuing other non-musical careers; this did not happen. Explaining his frame of mind when he made the album, Manson said, ""You get frustrated sometimes when you know that your heart is really buried in your art, and you know more success equals being more mediocre. So you have to redefine success, and you can't compete with people who don't do what you do.""

Initially, the album was going to include a duet between the band's frontman and Garbage vocalist Shirley Manson. The track – a cover of The Human League's ""Don't You Want Me"" (1981) – was recorded after the two artists met at a Yeah Yeah Yeahs concert and enjoyed each other's company. After the cover's completion, Marilyn admitted that he ""wasn't in the best frame of mind when I did it"". Shirley commented on the cover: ""It's really cool but neither of us felt comfortable putting it on our records so I don't know if it will ever come out. I hope it does. Our voices sound fantastic in a very Beauty and the Beast kind of way."" Both singers wanted to try to collaborate again sometime in the future, and Manson said that he enjoyed working with Shirley.

After making the decision not to include the duet on Lest We Forget, Marilyn Manson took a break from making music. After receiving fellatio with a rosary wrapped around his penis, Manson had the idea to cover Depeche Mode's ""Personal Jesus"" (1989) for the album. Manson said that he wanted to cover ""Personal Jesus"" because he found Depeche Mode's music hypnotic, sexy and inspirational. Manson told MTV that ""I thought if I had to write a song, [the lyrics of 'Personal Jesus' are] exactly what I would say. And that's why I picked this song, because I think it takes a little more of an ironic tone when you put it in context with what's going on today."" The band's version of ""Personal Jesus"" is the only new song on the album, and was released as a single.

The cover of Lest We Forget is a watercolor self-portrait by Manson entitled Experience Is the Mistress of Fools. Copies of Lest We Forget contain a booklet with 29 pictures of the band's frontman, while a limited edition version of the record includes a bonus DVD containing 16 of the band's music videos. The deluxe version also includes the uncensored version of the ""Saint"" music video, which had not previously been released. MTV reported that the band would embark on the Against All Gods Tour in support of the compilation.

Critical reception

In Spin, Chuck Klosterman called the compilation ""[f]ucking awesome"" and said ""there are only about ten compelling metal acts out there right now, and Marilyn Manson is three of them."" BBC Music's Richard Banks praised the album's ""superb production"" and Manson's ""genius one-liners"", saying ""when the knob labelled 'shock-tactics' is already set to 10, one can't help but wonder where [Manson will] go from here."" The Chicago Maroon Matt Zakosek opined ""It would be easy to write a pithy, sarcastic review deriding Manson for his over-the-top showmanship-but sometime in the midst of all that devilish preening and posturing, he found the time to make some pretty good music.""

Richard Abowitz of Rolling Stone stated that Lest We Forget ""includes all of [Manson's] essential pied-piper calls to alienated suburban youth"" and that ""Manson's mix of fetish, goth, hedonism and metal still jells"". A reviewer for Blabbermouth.net said that the album's track listing features ""all of the group's classics"". Monica S. Kuebler of Exclaim! said ""if you've been holding onto your hard-earned bones waiting for that one essential Marilyn Manson collection (without the filler), you may want to proceed directly to the nearest record store and turn those bones over immediately.""

Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic found the album's omission of ""Dope Hat"" (1994), ""Man That You Fear"" (1996) and ""I Don't Like the Drugs (But the Drugs Like Me)"" (1998) ""curious"". He added that ""Nevertheless, [Lest We Forget] has enough of the hits to make this worthwhile for the casual fans, as well as those listeners who never wanted to admit that [the band's] late-'90s alt-rock radio staples were guilty pleasures."" In his book Dissecting Marilyn Manson, Gavin Baddeley opined that ""for an album artist like Manson, [greatest hits] collections do fly in the face of the careful structure behind his best work, where the running order is an intrinsic feature of the package."" Baddeley felt that, like the band's EP Smells Like Children (1995), ""Lest We Forget is redeemed by a clever cover of an eighties pop song, in this case Depeche Mode's 'Personal Jesus'"". Writing for PopMatters, Lance Teegarden described the band's cover of ""Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)"" (1995), ""The Beautiful People"" (1996) and ""Mobscene"" (2003) as ""[a] few choice hits on a far too lengthy and same-sounding best-of.""

Commercial performance
Industry forecasters predicted the album was on course to debut on the Billboard 200 with first week sales of around 60,000 units. It went on to debut at number nine on the chart, selling 78,715 copies on its first week. It would spend a total of 27 weeks on the chart, and was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America in October 2005 for shipments in excess of 500,000 units. As of November 2010, Lest We Forget had sold over a million copies in the United States. It also debuted at number three on the Canadian Albums Chart.

The album was successful internationally as well, particularly in Europe, where it debuted at number five on Billboards European Top 100 Albums after peaking within the top 10 of national record charts in Austria, Germany, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. It also peaked at number two on the Compilation Albums Chart in France, and was certified gold by the Syndicat National de l'Édition Phonographique (SNEP) for shipments in excess of 100,000 units there. In 2017, IFPI Denmark awarded the record a platinum certification for shipments of over 20,000 units. The set originally peaked at number 20 on Denmark's Hitlisten. Similarly, Lest We Forget received a platinum award from the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) in 2017 for shipments in excess of 300,000 copies there. The album peaked at number four on the UK Albums Chart upon release, and peaked also at the same position on the German Albums Chart, where it was certified gold by the Bundesverband Musikindustrie (BVMI) for shipments of over 100,000 units.

The album peaked at number 15 in both Australia and Japan, and debuted at number nine in New Zealand. It was certified gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) for shipments of over 35,000 copies in that country. It also peaked within the top 20 of the national charts in Belgium, Greece, Italy, Norway, Portugal, and Scotland.

In this he is mocked by a Ferryman, or boat-builders in another account, and tells them how they will soon be out of a job.

Aetiological myth
Aristotle mentions in his Meteorologica how Aesop once teased a ferryman by relating to him a myth concerning Charybdis. With one gulp of the sea she brought the mountains to view; islands appeared after the next. The third is yet to come and will dry the sea altogether, thus depriving the ferryman of his livelihood. Aristotle’s reason for reporting this was in connection with the belief of the pre-Socratic philosopher Democritus that the sea’s level was gradually lowering and that it would eventually disappear.

Some centuries later, a similar retort was recorded by Babrius when Aesop was mocked by shipbuilders. In this case he told them the creation myth in which the king of the gods wished to make dry land emerge when there was only chaos and water. Earth was therefore commanded to take three gulps, the third of which will dry up the sea altogether. The fable is numbered 8 in the Perry Index. Babrius commented on the situation that people who cheek those smarter than themselves are asking for trouble.

Life
He was the eldest son of George Vansittart, M.P., of Bisham Abbey, Berkshire, by Sarah, daughter of the Rev. Sir James Stonhouse, 11th Baronet of Radley, Berkshire. Vice-Admiral Henry Vansittart (1777–1843) was his younger brother. Henry Vansittart (1732–1770) and Robert Vansittart were his uncles. He was educated at Winchester School, at a military academy at Strasbourg, and at Christ Church, Oxford, where he matriculated on 7 November 1785.

After obtaining a commission as ensign in the 19th Foot on 18 October 1786, he was allowed a year's leave to study military science at Brunswick and attend the Prussian manœuvres. He became lieutenant on 25 December 1787, exchanged to the 38th Foot on 12 March 1788, and obtained a company in the 18th Foot on 23 June 1790. He joined that regiment at Gibraltar, went with it to Toulon in 1793, took part in the defence, and was one of the last men to leave the place. He became major in the New South Wales Corps on 20 November 1793, and lieutenant-colonel of the 95th Foot on 21 February 1794. He took part with it in the expedition to the Cape under Sir Alured Clarke in 1795. He was made colonel in the army on 26 January 1797; but the 95th was broken up in the course of that year, and for the next three years he was on half-pay and in the Berkshire Militia, which his uncle, Colonel Arthur Vansittart, had previously commanded.

On 10 April 1801 he became lieutenant-colonel of the 68th Foot, went with it to the West Indies, and was present at the capture of St Lucia in June 1803. On 25 September he was promoted major-general, and served on the staff in England from 1804 to 1806, and in Ireland from 1806 to 1810, when he became lieutenant-general (25 July). While in command of the Oxford district he received the degree of D.C.L. on 26 June 1805. He had been given the colonelcy of the 12th reserve battalion on 9 July 1803, and was transferred to the 1st garrison battalion on 25 February 1805. The colours of this battalion were afterwards presented to him, and now hang in the great hall in Bisham Abbey. He became general on 19 July 1821, and died on 4 February 1824.

On 29 October 1818 he had married Anna Maria, daughter and coheiress of Thomas Copson of Sheppey Hall, Leicestershire. She survived him, with one son, George Henry Vansittart  the Younger (1823–1885), and a second son, Augustus Arthur Vansittart   (1824–1882), who was born posthumously. There is a portrait of him in uniform, by Sir George Hayter, at Bisham Abbey. A mourning brooch, presumably commissioned by his family, inscribed with details of his birth and death and containing a lock of his hair appeared on Episode 12 of Season 16 of Pawn Stars in September, 2019.

He is a member of the Simpson political family of Wyoming. From 1981 to 1984, he was a member of the Wyoming House of Representatives from Sheridan, where at the time he was employed in administration by the community college, Sheridan College.
 
In 1986, Simpson was the Wyoming Republican gubernatorial nominee. He polled 46 percent of the vote in his race against the Democrat Michael J. Sullivan of Douglas in Converse County in southeastern Wyoming.

Early life and education
A native of Cody in Park County, Wyoming, Simpson is one of two sons of the late Governor and U.S. Senator Milward L. Simpson and Lorna (née Kooi), a native of Chicago. Pete Simpson's great-grandparents, Maggie and John Simpson, platted and named Jackson, Wyoming. Another great-grandparent, Finn Burnett, knew Sacajawea and was an advisor the Shoshone chief, Washakie.

Simpson graduated in 1953 from the University of Wyoming in Laramie, where he was a member of the student senate, lettered in basketball with the UW Cowboys, and received a Bachelor of Arts, the first of his three degrees in the field of history. After four years in the United States Navy, he moved to Billings, Montana, where he starred in a local television program and became involved in folk music.

Career

Academics 
Simpson returned to University of Wyoming and in 1962 earned his Master of Arts degree, with his thesis, A History of the First Wyoming Legislature. He would be a member of that body some two decades thereafter.
 
Simpson thereafter earned his Ph.D. from the University of Oregon in Eugene, Oregon. His dissertation on the cattle industry was later published as a book, ""The Community of Cattlemen: A Social History of the Cattle Industry in Southeastern Oregon, 1869-1912,"" (Moscow: University of Idaho Press, 1987). He is a member of the fraternity Alpha Tau Omega. In the early 1970s, Simpson returned to Wyoming to accept a position as the assistant to the president at Casper College in Casper, the state's second largest city. He then became dean of instruction at Sheridan College.

After his legislative service ended in 1984, Simpson left Sheridan to become vice president for development at the University of Wyoming and the executive director of the UW Foundation. He resigned from UW to run for governor but returned in 1987 as vice president for development and alumni affairs. Thereafter, he was elevated to his terminal position of UW vice president for institutional advancement. After retirement in 1997, Simpson remained in Laramie and taught history on an adjunct basis at UW and was in 1999 and 2000 the Milward Simpson Distinguished Visiting Professor, named for his father.

The Simpson Fund has financed various speakers of different backgrounds and disciplines to UW, including former United States Secretary of State James A. Baker, III, former United States Secretary of the Interior James G. Watt, U.S. President Gerald R. Ford, Jr., and ABC journalist Sam Donaldson. Over the years, Simpson has emceed various UW events. In 2009, he was inducted for ""Special Achievement"" into the UW Athletics Hall of Fame.
 
While at UW, Simpson and his brother, Alan, were invited to team teach for one semester only by the political science department, but Pete Simpson was still teaching the course twelve years later. After he left the U.S. Senate, Alan Simpson became a lecturer for several years for the Institute of Politics at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, but he returned to Cody in 2000 to practice law with his two sons, Colin and William Simpson.

Long involved in civic affairs, Pete Simpson in 2010 joined his former gubernatorial rival, Mike Sullivan, at a fundraising appearance in Rock Springs in southwestern Wyoming for the benefit of the library in Sweetwater County.

Pete Simpson narrated the hour-long documentary Over Wyoming which was produced by WyomingPBS in 2016.

Politics
During his four-year stint in the legislature, Simpson was a member of the House Appropriations Committee. Two years after leaving the state House, he waged a hard-fought race for governor but fell short. UW history professor Phil Roberts suggested that the principal reason that Pete Simpson may have lost that race to Mike Sullivan was that Alan Simpson was already serving in his second term in the U.S. Senate: ""There are a number of people that speculate because there already was a Simpson in the Senate, they probably wanted just one Simpson at a time.""

Roberts said that family names have been less important in Wyoming politics than in other states with prominent political families. That view held true when, in 2014, when Liz Cheney, daughter of former U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney, challenged Alan Simpson's Senate successor, Mike Enzi in the Republican primary. Enzi won the election.

Personal life
Simpson and his brother, former state representative and U.S. Senator Alan K. Simpson, both carry their mother's maiden name as their middle name. Pete Simpson is an uncle of former State Representative Colin M. Simpson of Cody, who ran unsuccessfully for governor in the Republican primary election held on August 17, 2010 . The nomination and the general election on November 2 went to Matt Mead, a member of another Wyoming Republican political family, the Hansens, referring to former Governor and former U.S. Senator Clifford Hansen. Colin Simpson was Wyoming House Speaker in his last term from 2009 to 2010.

Simpson and his wife, the former Lynne Alice Livingston left Laramie around 2011 to return to Cody. Their younger son, Peter K. Simpson, Jr. is an Obie Award- winning actor and long time performer, writer, director and trainer for Blue Man Group. In 2010, he appeared at UW as Prince Hamlet in a theatre production of the Shakespearean play, with Pete Simpson cast as the Ghost of Hamlet's father. The junior Simpson recalls, with ""the ghost and son scene, ... I could feel an energy shift in the room. It was hard not to get misty eyed.""

The older son, Milward Allen Simpson (born 1962), is the director of the Wyoming Department of State Parks and Cultural Resources, first under Democratic Governor Dave Freudenthal and under current Republican Governor Matt Mead. This Milward Simpson had been mentioned as a potential Democratic candidate for governor at the same time that his cousin, Colin Simpson, sought the Republican nomination against Matt Mead for the office that the Simpsons' paternal grandfather held from 1955 to 1959, before both had been born.

Milward Allen Simpson said that his political values as a Democrat are identical to those that his grandfather ""instilled in us -– is that it's important to be who you are and stand up for what you believe in, and be honest and truthful. ... It doesn't really matter what your party stripe is, if you love the state and you want to serve it, that's what you've got to do. ... Blood's much thicker than partisan politics.""

The middle child is daughter, Margaret Ann Simpson-Crabaugh who is an actress, singer/songwriter and teaches Enneagram workshops.

In 2011, the UW Alumni Association honored Pete Simpson with its Medallion Service Award, first issued in 1968 but not given annually. It recognizes outstanding dedication and service to the university.
 
In June 2012, still involved in occasional acting, Simpson played the celebrated frontiersman William F. Cody at the opening of the redesigned Cody museum at the Buffalo Bill Historical Center in Cody.

The Peter K. Simpson papers from 1977 to 2009, the majority from his political career from 1980 to 1987, are located in the UW archives in Laramie.

He also introduced a significant number of plants from the Americas and Europe to East Java.

Botanical career
Buysman founded a botanical garden in the Dutch city of Middelburg, called the Hortus Plantarum Diaphoricarum or, in English, the Garden of Diverse Plants. This garden was run as a business, rather than as a tourist attraction. Buysman cultivated and sold plant specimens grown in the garden, under the title Herbarium Analyticum. To acquire plants which he then cultivated and went on to sell, Buysman relied on an international network of collectors from whom he received plant material from around the globe.

In 1906-1907, Buysman moved to the colonial Dutch East Indies, where he was employed at the Hotel Nongkodjadjar in the Pasaruan Regency. There, he set up an experimental garden, and continued to cultivate plants he received from foreign collectors. According to the Office of Seed and Plant Introduction, Buysman focused on introducing plants to Indonesia, and appears to have introduced some foreign species to Indonesia, such as Cecropia pachystachya, Salvia tiliifolia, Cenchrus tribuloides, Elymus repens, Bromus sterilis, and Bromus erectus, although not all of these species have persisted. Backer also ascribed the presence of non-native plants when he visited Nongkodjadjar in 1925, such as Salvia tiliifolia, Calyptocarpus vialis, Melampodium perfoliatum,  and Marsypianthes chamaedrys to Buysman's acclimation activities.

Although Buysman never named any plant species himself, he collected the holotype of Pseudophegopteris tenggerensis Holttum.  

While nothing remains of the nursery in  today, botanical specimens collected and distributed by Buysman are held in herbaria across the globe, including the National Herbarium of Victoria, the Herbarium of the University of Coimbra, 
Harvard University Herbaria, Brown University herbarium, and herbarium at Kew Gardens.

""']","John Caldwell Calhoun (; March 18, 1782March 31, 1850) was an American statesman and political theorist from South Carolina who held many important positions including being the seventh vice president of the United States from 1825 to 1832, while adamantly defending slavery and protecting the interests of the white South. He began his political career as a nationalist, modernizer, and proponent of a strong national government and protective tariffs. In the late 1820s, his views changed radically, and he became a leading proponent of states' rights, limited government, nullification, and opposition to high tariffs. He saw Northern acceptance of those policies as a condition of the South remaining in the Union. His beliefs and warnings heavily influenced the South's secession from the Union in 1860–1861.

Calhoun began his political career with election to the House of Representatives in 1810. As a prominent leader of the war hawk faction, Calhoun strongly supported the War of 1812. He served as Secretary of War under President James Monroe and, in that position, reorganized and modernized the War Department. Calhoun was a candidate for the presidency in the 1824 election. After failing to gain support, he agreed to be a candidate for vice president. The Electoral College elected Calhoun vice president by an overwhelming majority. He served under John Quincy Adams and continued under Andrew Jackson, who defeated Adams in the election of 1828, making Calhoun the most recent U.S. vice president to serve under two different presidents.

Calhoun had a difficult relationship with Jackson, primarily because of the Nullification Crisis and the Petticoat affair. In contrast with his previous nationalism, Calhoun vigorously supported South Carolina's right to nullify federal tariff legislation that he believed unfairly favored the North, which put him into conflict with unionists such as Jackson. In 1832, with only a few months remaining in his second term, Calhoun resigned as vice president and entered the Senate. He sought the Democratic Party nomination for the presidency in 1844 but lost to surprise nominee James K. Polk, who won the general election. Calhoun served as Secretary of State under President John Tyler from 1844 to 1845, and in that role supported the annexation of Texas as a means to extend the slave power and helped to settle the Oregon boundary dispute with Britain. Calhoun returned to the Senate, where he opposed the Mexican–American War, the Wilmot Proviso, and the Compromise of 1850 before he died in 1850. He often served as a virtual independent who variously aligned as needed, with Democrats and Whigs.

Later in life, Calhoun became known as the ""cast-iron man"" for his rigid defense of white Southern beliefs and practices. His concept of republicanism emphasized approval of slavery and minority states' rights as particularly embodied by the South. He owned dozens of slaves in Fort Hill, South Carolina. Calhoun asserted that slavery, rather than being a ""necessary evil"", was a ""positive good"" that benefited both slaves and owners. To protect minority rights against majority rule, he called for a concurrent majority by which the minority could block some proposals that it felt infringed on their liberties. To that end, Calhoun supported states' rights, and nullification through which states could declare null and void federal laws that they viewed as unconstitutional. He was one of the ""Great Triumvirate"" or the ""Immortal Trio"" of Congressional leaders, along with his colleagues Daniel Webster and Henry Clay.

Early life
John Caldwell Calhoun was born in Abbeville District, South Carolina, on March 18, 1782, the fourth child of Patrick Calhoun (1727–1796) and his wife Martha (Caldwell). Patrick's father, also named Patrick Calhoun, had joined the Scotch-Irish immigration movement from County Donegal to southwestern Pennsylvania. After the death of the elder Patrick in 1741, the family moved to southwestern Virginia. Following the defeat of British General Edward Braddock at the Battle of the Monongahela in 1755, the family, fearing Indian attacks, moved to South Carolina in 1756.

Patrick Calhoun belonged to the Calhoun clan in the tight-knit Scotch-Irish community on the Southern frontier. He was known as an Indian fighter and an ambitious surveyor, farmer, planter, and politician, elected to the South Carolina Legislature. As a Presbyterian, he stood opposed to the established Anglican planter elite based in Charleston. He was not a patriot in the American Revolution and opposed ratification of the federal Constitution on grounds of states' rights and personal liberties. Calhoun would eventually adopt his father's states' rights beliefs.

Young Calhoun showed scholastic talent, and although schools were scarce on the Carolina frontier, he was enrolled briefly in an academy in Appling, Georgia. It soon closed. He continued his studies privately. When his father died, his brothers were away starting business careers, and so the 14-year-old Calhoun took over management of the family farm and five other farms. For four years he simultaneously kept up his reading and his hunting and fishing. The family decided he should continue his education, and so he resumed studies at the academy after it reopened.

With financing from his brothers, he went to Yale College in Connecticut in 1802. For the first time in his life, Calhoun encountered serious, advanced, well-organized intellectual dialogue that could shape his mind. Yale was dominated by President Timothy Dwight, a Federalist who became his mentor. Dwight's brilliance entranced (and sometimes repelled) Calhoun.

Biographer John Niven says:

Dwight repeatedly denounced Jeffersonian democracy, and Calhoun challenged him in class. Dwight could not shake Calhoun's commitment to republicanism. ""Young man,"" retorted Dwight, ""your talents are of a high order and might justify you for any station, but I deeply regret that you do not love sound principles better than sophistry—you seem to possess a most unfortunate bias for error."" Dwight also expounded on the strategy of secession from the Union as a legitimate solution for New England's disagreements with the national government.

Calhoun made friends easily, read widely, and was a noted member of the debating society of Brothers in Unity. He graduated as valedictorian in 1804. He studied law at the nation's first independent law school, Tapping Reeve Law School in Litchfield, Connecticut, where he worked with Tapping Reeve and James Gould. He was admitted to the South Carolina bar in 1807.

Biographer Margaret Coit argues that:

Personal life

In January 1811, Calhoun married Floride Bonneau Colhoun, a first cousin once removed. She was the daughter of wealthy United States Senator and lawyer John  E. Colhoun, a leader of Charleston high society.

The couple had 10 children over 18 years: Andrew Pickens Calhoun, Floride Pure, Jane, Anna Maria, Elizabeth, Patrick, John Caldwell Jr., Martha Cornelia, James Edward, and William Lowndes Calhoun. Three girls: Floride Pure, Jane, and Elizabeth, died in infancy. Calhoun's fourth child, Anna Maria, married Thomas Green Clemson, who later founded Clemson University in South Carolina.

Calhoun was not openly religious. He was raised as an orthodox Presbyterian, but he was attracted to Southern varieties of Unitarianism of the sort that attracted Jefferson. Southern Unitarianism was generally less organized than the variety popular in New England. He was generally not outspoken about his religious beliefs. After his marriage, Calhoun and his wife attended the Episcopal Church, of which she was a member. In 1821 he became a founding member of All Souls Unitarian Church in Washington, D.C.

Historian Merrill D. Peterson describes Calhoun: ""Intensely serious and severe, he could never write a love poem, though he often tried, because every line began with 'whereas' ...""

House of Representatives

War of 1812
With a base among the Irish and Scotch Irish, Calhoun won election to South Carolina's 6th congressional district of the House of Representatives in 1810. He immediately became a leader of the War Hawks, along with Speaker Henry Clay of Kentucky and South Carolina congressmen William Lowndes and Langdon Cheves. Brushing aside the vehement objections of both anti-war New Englanders and arch-conservative Jeffersonians led by John Randolph of Roanoke, they demanded war against Britain, claiming that American honor and republican values had been violated by the British refusal to recognize American shipping rights. As a member, and later acting chairman, of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Calhoun played a major role in drafting two key documents in the push for war, the Report on Foreign Relations and the War Report of 1812. Drawing on the linguistic tradition of the Declaration of Independence, Calhoun's committee called for a declaration of war in ringing phrases, denouncing Britain's ""lust for power"", ""unbounded tyranny"", and ""mad ambition"".

The United States declared war on Britain on June 18, inaugurating the War of 1812. The opening phase involved multiple disasters for American arms, as well as a financial crisis when the Treasury could barely pay the bills. The conflict caused economic hardship for Americans, as the Royal Navy blockaded the ports and cut off imports, exports, and the coastal trade. Several attempted invasions of Canada were fiascos, but the U.S. in 1813 seized control of Lake Erie and broke the power of hostile Indians in battles such as the Battle of the Thames in Canada in 1813 and the Battle of Horseshoe Bend in Alabama in 1814. These Indians had, in many cases, cooperated with the British or Spanish in opposing American interests.

Calhoun labored to raise troops, provide funds, speed logistics, rescue the currency, and regulate commerce to aid the war effort. One colleague hailed him as ""the young Hercules who carried the war on his shoulders"". Disasters on the battlefield made him double his legislative efforts to overcome the obstructionism of John Randolph, Daniel Webster, and other opponents of the war. By 1814  the British were thwarted at the invasions of New York and Baltimore, but Napoleon Bonaparte capitulated, meaning America would now face Britain's formidable renforcement with units previously committed to Europe if the war were to continue. British and American diplomats signed the Treaty of Ghent undertaking a return to the borders of 1812 with no gains or losses. Before the treaty reached the Senate for ratification, and even before news of its signing reached New Orleans, a British invasion force was decisively defeated in January 1815 at the Battle of New Orleans, making a national hero of General Andrew Jackson. Americans celebrated what they called a ""second war of independence"" against Britain. This led to the beginning of the ""Era of Good Feelings"", an era marked by the formal demise of the Federalist Party and increased nationalism.

Postwar planning
Despite American successes, the mismanagement of the Army during the war distressed Calhoun, and he resolved to strengthen and centralize the War Department. The militia had proven itself quite unreliable during the war and Calhoun saw the need for a permanent and professional military force. In 1816 he called for building an effective navy, including steam frigates, as well as a standing army of adequate size. The British blockade of the coast had underscored the necessity of rapid means of internal transportation; Calhoun proposed a system of ""great permanent roads"". The blockade had cut off the import of manufactured items, so he emphasized the need to encourage more domestic manufacture, fully realizing that industry was based in the Northeast. The dependence of the old financial system on import duties was devastated when the blockade cut off imports. Calhoun called for a system of internal taxation that would not collapse from a war-time shrinkage of maritime trade, as the tariffs had done. The expiration of the charter of the First Bank of the United States had also distressed the Treasury, so to reinvigorate and modernize the economy Calhoun called for a new national bank. A new bank was chartered as the Second Bank of the United States by Congress and approved by President James Madison in 1816. Through his proposals, Calhoun emphasized a national footing and downplayed sectionalism and states rights. Historian Ulrich B. Phillips says that at this stage of Calhoun's career, ""The word nation was often on his lips, and his conviction was to enhance national unity which he identified with national power.""

Rhetorical style
Regarding his career in the House of Representatives, an observer commented that Calhoun was ""the most elegant speaker that sits in the House ... His gestures are easy and graceful, his manner forcible, and language elegant; but above all, he confines himself closely to the subject, which he always understands, and enlightens everyone within hearing.""

His talent for public speaking required systematic self-discipline and practice. A later critic noted the sharp contrast between his hesitant conversations and his fluent speaking styles, adding that Calhoun ""had so carefully cultivated his naturally poor voice as to make his utterance clear, full, and distinct in speaking and while not at all musical it yet fell pleasantly on the ear"". Calhoun was ""a high-strung man of ultra intellectual cast"". As such, Calhoun was not known for charisma. He was often seen as harsh and aggressive with other representatives. But he was a brilliant intellectual orator and strong organizer. Historian Russell Kirk says, ""That zeal which flared like Greek fire in Randolph burned in Calhoun, too; but it was contained in the Cast-iron Man as in a furnace, and Calhoun's passion glowed out only through his eyes. No man was more stately, more reserved.""

John Quincy Adams concluded in 1821 that ""Calhoun is a man of fair and candid mind, of honorable principles, of clear and quick understanding, of cool self-possession, of enlarged philosophical views, and ardent patriotism. He is above all sectional and factious prejudices more than any other statesman of this Union with whom I have ever acted."" Historian Charles Wiltse noted Calhoun's evolution, ""Though he is known today primarily for his sectionalism, Calhoun was the last of the great political leaders of his time to take a sectional position—later than Daniel Webster, later than Henry Clay, later than Adams himself.""

Secretary of War and postwar nationalism

In 1817, the deplorable state of the War Department led four men to decline offers from President James Monroe to accept the office of Secretary of War before Calhoun finally assumed the role. Calhoun took office on December 8 and served until 1825. He continued his role as a leading nationalist during the Era of Good Feelings. He proposed an elaborate program of national reforms to the infrastructure that he believed would speed economic modernization. His priority was an effective navy, including steam frigates, and in the second place a standing army of adequate size—and as further preparation for an emergency, ""great permanent roads"", ""a certain encouragement"" to manufactures, and a system of internal taxation that would not collapse from a war-time shrinkage of maritime trade, like customs duties.

A reform-minded modernizer, Calhoun attempted to institute centralization and efficiency in the Indian Department and in the Army by establishing new coastal and frontier fortifications and building military roads, but Congress either failed to respond to his reforms or responded with hostility. Calhoun's frustration with congressional inaction, political rivalries, and ideological differences spurred him to create the Bureau of Indian Affairs in 1824. The responsibilities of the bureau were to manage treaty negotiations, schools, and trade with Indians, in addition to handling all expenditures and correspondence concerning Indian affairs. Thomas McKenney was appointed as the first head of the bureau.

As secretary, Calhoun had responsibility for the management of Indian affairs. He promoted a plan, adopted by Monroe in 1825, to preserve the sovereignty of eastern Indians by relocating them to western reservations they could control without interference from state governments. In over seven years Calhoun supervised the negotiation and ratification of 40 treaties with Indian tribes. Calhoun opposed the invasion of Spanish Florida launched in 1818 by General Jackson during the First Seminole War, which was done without direct authorization from Calhoun or President Monroe, and in private with other cabinet members, advocated censuring of Jackson as punishment. Calhoun claimed that Jackson had begun a war against Spain in violation of the Constitution and, that he had contradicted Calhoun's explicit orders in doing so. Specific official instructions not to invade Florida or attack the Spanish were not issued by the administration. However, Calhoun supported the execution of Alexander Arbuthnot and Robert Ambrister, two British soldiers living in Florida who were accused of inciting the Seminole to make war against the United States. Calhoun accused the British of being involved in ""wickedness, corruption, and barbarity at which the heart sickens and which in this enlightened age it ought not scarcely to be believed that a Christian nation would have participated"". He added that he hoped the executions of Arbuthnot and Ambrister would deter the British and any other nations ""who by false promises delude and excite an Indian tribe to all the deeds of savage war"". The United States annexed Florida from Spain in 1819 through the Adams–Onís Treaty.

Calhoun's tenure as Secretary of War witnessed the outbreak of the Missouri crisis in December 1818, when a petition arrived from Missouri settlers seeking admission into the Union as a slave state. In response, Representative James Tallmadge Jr. of New York proposed two amendments to the bill designed to restrict the spread of slavery into what would become the new state. These amendments touched off an intense debate between North and South that had some talking openly of disunion. In February 1820, Calhoun predicted to Secretary of State John Quincy Adams, a New Englander, that the Missouri issue ""would not produce a dissolution"" of the Union. ""But if it should,"" Calhoun went on, ""the South would of necessity be compelled to form an alliance with...Great Britain."" ""I said that would be returning to the colonial state,"" Adams recalled saying afterward. According to Adams, ""He said, yes, pretty much, but it would be forced upon them.""

After the war ended in 1815 the ""Old Republicans"" in Congress, with their Jeffersonian ideology for an economy in the federal government, sought to reduce the operations and finances of the War Department. Calhoun's political rivalry with William H. Crawford, the Secretary of the Treasury, over the pursuit of the presidency in the 1824 election, complicated Calhoun's tenure as War Secretary. The general lack of military action following the war meant that a large army, such as that preferred by Calhoun, was no longer considered necessary. The ""Radicals"", a group of strong states' rights supporters who mostly favored Crawford for president in the coming election, were inherently suspicious of large armies. Some allegedly also wanted to hinder Calhoun's presidential aspirations for that election. Thus, on March 2, 1821, Congress passed the Reduction Act, which reduced the number of enlisted men of the army by half, from 11,709 to 5,586, and the number of the officer corps by a fifth, from 680 to 540. Calhoun, though concerned, offered little protest. Later, to provide the army with a more organized command structure, which had been severely lacking during the War of 1812, he appointed Major General Jacob Brown to a position that would later become known as ""Commanding General of the United States Army"".

Vice presidency (1825–1832)

1824 and 1828 elections and Adams presidency

Calhoun was initially a candidate for President of the United States in the election of 1824. Four other men also sought the presidency: Andrew Jackson, Adams, Crawford, and Henry Clay. Calhoun failed to win the endorsement of the South Carolina legislature, and his supporters in Pennsylvania decided to abandon his candidacy in favor of Jackson's, and instead supported him for vice president. Other states soon followed, and Calhoun therefore allowed himself to become a candidate for vice president rather than president. The Electoral College elected Calhoun vice president by a landslide on December 1, 1824. He won 182 of 261 electoral votes, while five other men received the remaining votes. No presidential candidate received a majority in the Electoral College, and the election was ultimately resolved by the House of Representatives, where Adams was declared the winner over Crawford and Jackson, who in the election had led Adams in both popular vote and electoral vote. After Clay, the Speaker of the House, was appointed Secretary of State by Adams, Jackson's supporters denounced what they considered a ""corrupt bargain"" between Adams and Clay to give Adams the presidency in exchange for Clay receiving the office of Secretary of State, the holder of which had traditionally become the next president. Calhoun also expressed some concerns, which caused friction between him and Adams.

Calhoun also opposed President Adams' plan to send a delegation to observe a meeting of South and Central American leaders in Panama, believing that the United States should stay out of foreign affairs. Calhoun became disillusioned with Adams' high tariff policies and increased centralization of government through a network of ""internal improvements"", which he now saw as a threat to the rights of the states. Calhoun wrote to Jackson on June 4, 1826, informing him that he would support Jackson's second campaign for the presidency in 1828. The two were never particularly close friends. Calhoun never fully trusted Jackson, a frontiersman and popular war hero, but hoped that his election would bring some reprieve from Adams's anti-states' rights policies. Jackson selected Calhoun as his running mate, and together they defeated Adams and his running mate Richard Rush. Calhoun thus became the second of two vice presidents to serve under two different presidents. The only other man who accomplished this feat was George Clinton, who served as vice president from 1805 to 1812 under Thomas Jefferson and James Madison.

During the election, Jackson's aide James Alexander Hamilton attempted a rapprochement between Jackson and Crawford, whom Jackson resented owing partially to the belief that it was he, not Calhoun, who had opposed the invasion of Florida. Hamilton spoke about this prospect with Governor John Forsyth of Georgia, who acted as a mediator between the Jackson campaign and Crawford. Forsyth wrote a letter back to Hamilton in which he claimed that Crawford had stated to him that it was Calhoun, not Crawford, who had supported censuring Jackson for his invasion of Florida. Knowing that the letter could destroy the partnership between Jackson and Calhoun, Hamilton and fellow-Jackson aide William B. Lewis allowed it to remain in Hamilton's possession without informing Jackson or the public of its existence.

Petticoat affair

Early in Jackson's administration, Floride Calhoun organized Cabinet wives (hence the term ""petticoats"") against Peggy Eaton, wife of Secretary of War John Eaton, and refused to associate with her. They alleged that John and Peggy Eaton had engaged in an adulterous affair while she was still legally married to her first husband, and that her recent behavior was unladylike. The allegations of scandal created an intolerable situation for Jackson. The Petticoat affair ended friendly relations between Calhoun and Jackson.

Jackson sided with the Eatons. He and his late wife Rachel Donelson had undergone similar political attacks stemming from their marriage in 1791. The two had married in 1791 not knowing that Rachel's first husband, Lewis Robards, had failed to finalize the expected divorce. Once the divorce was finalized, they married legally in 1794, but the episode caused a major controversy, and was used against him in the 1828 campaign. Jackson saw attacks on Eaton stemming ultimately from the political opposition of Calhoun, who had failed to silence his wife's criticisms. The Calhouns were widely regarded as the chief instigators. Jackson, who loved to personalize disputes, also saw the Petticoat affair as a direct challenge to his authority, because it involved lower-ranking executive officials and their wives seeming to contest his ability to choose whomever he wanted for his cabinet. Secretary of State Martin Van Buren, a widower, took Jackson's side and defended the Eatons. Van Buren was a northerner and a supporter of the 1828 tariff (which Calhoun bitterly opposed). Calhoun and Van Buren were the main contenders for the vice-presidential nomination in the ensuing election, and the nominee would then presumably be the party's choice to succeed Jackson. That Van Buren sided with the Eatons, in addition to disagreements between Jackson and Calhoun on other issues, mainly the Nullification Crisis, marked him as Calhoun's likely vice presidential successor.

Some historians, including Jackson biographers Richard B. Latner and Robert V. Remini, believe that the hostility towards the Eatons was rooted less in questions of proper behavior than in politics. Eaton had been in favor of the Tariff of Abominations. He was also politically close to Van Buren. Calhoun may have wanted to expel Eaton from the cabinet as a way of boosting his anti-tariff agenda and increasing his standing in the Democratic Party. Many cabinet members were Southern and could be expected to sympathize with such concerns, especially Treasury Secretary Samuel D. Ingham, who was allied with Calhoun and believed that he, not Van Buren, should succeed Jackson as president.

In 1830, reports had emerged accurately stating that Calhoun, as Secretary of War, had favored censuring Jackson for his 1818 invasion of Florida. These infuriated Jackson. Eventually, Lewis decided to reveal the existence of Forsyth's letter, and on April 30, Crawford wrote a second letter, this time to Forsyth, repeating the charge Forsyth represented him as having previously made. Jackson received the letter on May 12, which confirmed his suspicions. He claimed that Calhoun had ""betrayed"" him. Eaton took his revenge on Calhoun. For reasons unclear, Calhoun asked Eaton to approach Jackson about the possibility of Calhoun publishing his correspondence with Jackson at the time of the Seminole War. Eaton did nothing, leading Calhoun to believe that Jackson had approved the publication of the letters. Calhoun published them in the United States Telegraph, a newspaper edited by a Calhoun protégé, Duff Green. This gave the appearance of Calhoun trying to justify himself against a conspiracy to damage him and further enraged the President.

Finally in the spring of 1831, at the suggestion of Van Buren, who, like Jackson, supported the Eatons, Jackson replaced all but one of his Cabinet members, thereby limiting Calhoun's influence. Van Buren began the process by resigning as Secretary of State, facilitating Jackson's removal of others. Van Buren thereby grew in favor with Jackson, while the rift between the President and Calhoun was widened. Later, in 1832, Calhoun, as vice president, cast a tie-breaking vote against Jackson's nomination of Van Buren as Minister to Great Britain in a failed attempt to end Van Buren's political career. Missouri Senator Thomas Hart Benton, a staunch supporter of Jackson, then stated that Calhoun had ""elected a Vice President"", as Van Buren was able to move past his failed nomination as Minister to Great Britain and instead gain the Democratic Party's vice-presidential nomination in the 1832 election, in which he and Jackson were victorious.

Nullification

Calhoun had begun to oppose increases in protective tariffs, as they generally benefited Northerners more than Southerners. While he was vice president in the Adams administration, Jackson's supporters devised a high tariff legislation that placed duties on imports that were also made in New England. Calhoun had been assured that the northeastern interests would reject the Tariff of 1828, exposing pro-Adams New England congressmen to charges that they selfishly opposed legislation popular among Jacksonian Democrats in the west and mid-Atlantic States. The southern legislators miscalculated and the so-called ""Tariff of Abominations"" passed and was signed into law by President Adams. Frustrated, Calhoun returned to his South Carolina plantation, where he anonymously composed South Carolina Exposition and Protest, an essay rejecting the centralization philosophy and supporting the principle of nullification as a means to prevent a tyranny of a central government.

Calhoun supported the idea of nullification through a concurrent majority. Nullification is a legal theory that a state has the right to nullify, or invalidate, any federal law it deems unconstitutional. In Calhoun's words, it is ""the right of a State to interpose, in the last resort, in order to arrest an unconstitutional act of the General Government, within its limits"". Nullification can be traced back to arguments by Jefferson and Madison in writing the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions of 1798 against the Alien and Sedition Acts. Madison expressed the hope that the states would declare the acts unconstitutional, while Jefferson explicitly endorsed nullification. Calhoun openly argued for a state's right to secede from the Union, as a last resort to protect its liberty and sovereignty. In his later years, Madison rebuked supporters of nullification, stating that no state had the right to nullify federal law.

In ""South Carolina Exposition and Protest"", Calhoun argued that a state could veto any federal law that went beyond the enumerated powers and encroached upon the residual powers of the State. President Jackson, meanwhile, generally supported states' rights, but opposed nullification and secession. At the 1830 Jefferson Day dinner at Jesse Brown's Indian Queen Hotel, Jackson proposed a toast and proclaimed, ""Our federal Union, it must be preserved."" Calhoun replied, ""The Union, next to our liberty, the most dear. May we all remember that it can only be preserved by respecting the rights of the states, and distributing equally the benefit and burden of the Union."" Calhoun's publication of letters from the Seminole War in the Telegraph caused his relationship with Jackson to deteriorate further, thus contributing to the Nullification crisis. Jackson and Calhoun began an angry correspondence that lasted until Jackson stopped it in July.

Jackson supported a revision to tariff rates known as the Tariff of 1832. It was designed to placate the nullifiers by lowering tariff rates. Written by Treasury Secretary Louis McLane, the bill lowered duties from 45% to 27%. In May, Representative John Quincy Adams introduced a slightly revised version of the bill, which Jackson accepted. It passed Congress on July 9 and was signed by the president on July 14. The bill failed to satisfy extremists on either side. In October, the South Carolina legislature voted to call a convention to nullify the tariffs. On November 24, the South Carolina Nullification Convention passed an ordinance nullifying both the Tariff of 1832 and the Tariff of 1828 and threatening to secede if the federal government attempted to enforce the tariffs. In response, Jackson sent U.S. Navy warships to Charleston harbor, and threatened to hang Calhoun or any man who worked to support nullification or secession. After joining the Senate, Calhoun began to work with Clay on a new compromise tariff. A bill sponsored by the administration had been introduced by Representative Gulian C. Verplanck of New York, but it lowered rates more sharply than Clay and other protectionists desired. Clay managed to get Calhoun to agree to a bill with higher rates in exchange for Clay's opposition to Jackson's military threats and, perhaps, with the hope that he could win some Southern votes in his next bid for the presidency. On the same day, Congress passed the Force Bill, which empowered the President of the United States to use military force to ensure state compliance with federal law. South Carolina accepted the tariff, but in a final show of defiance, nullified the Force Bill. In Calhoun's speech against the Force Bill, delivered on February 5, 1833, no longer as vice president, he strongly endorsed nullification, at one point saying:

In his three-volume biography of Jackson, James Parton summed up Calhoun's role in the Nullification crisis: ""Calhoun began it. Calhoun continued it. Calhoun stopped it.""

Resignation
As tensions over nullification escalated, South Carolina Senator Robert Y. Hayne was considered less capable than Calhoun to represent South Carolina in the Senate debates, so in late 1832 Hayne resigned to become governor; Calhoun resigned as vice president, and the South Carolina legislature elected Calhoun to fill Hayne's Senate seat. Van Buren had already been elected as Jackson's new vice president, meaning that Calhoun had less than three months left on his term anyway. The South Carolina newspaper City Gazette commented on the change:

Biographer John Niven argues ""that these moves were part of a well-thought-out plan whereby Hayne would restrain the hotheads in the state legislature and Calhoun would defend his brainchild, nullification, in Washington against administration stalwarts and the likes of Daniel Webster, the new apostle of northern nationalism."" Calhoun was the first of two vice presidents to resign, the second being Spiro Agnew in 1973. During his terms as vice president, Calhoun made a record of 31 tie-breaking votes in the Senate.

First term in the U.S. Senate

When Calhoun took his seat in the Senate on December 29, 1832, his chances of becoming president were considered poor due to his involvement in the Nullification Crisis, which left him without connections to a major national party. After the implementation of the Compromise Tariff of 1833, which helped solve the Nullification Crisis, the Nullifier Party, along with other anti-Jackson politicians, formed a coalition known as the Whig Party. Calhoun sometimes affiliated with the Whigs, but chose to remain a virtual independent due to the Whig promotion of federally subsidized ""internal improvements"".

From 1833 to 1834, Jackson was engaged in removing federal funds from the Second Bank of the United States during the Bank War. Calhoun opposed this action, considering it a dangerous expansion of executive power. He called the men of the Jackson administration ""artful, cunning, and corrupt politicians, and not fearless warriors"". He accused Jackson of being ignorant about financial matters. As evidence, he cited the economic panic caused by Nicholas Biddle as a means to stop Jackson from destroying the Bank. On March 28, 1834, Calhoun voted with the Whig senators on a successful motion to censure Jackson for his removal of the funds. In 1837, he refused to attend the inauguration of Jackson's chosen successor, Van Buren, even as other powerful senators who opposed the administration, such as Webster and Clay, did witness the inauguration. However, by 1837, Calhoun generally had realigned himself with most of the Democrats' policies.

To restore his national stature, Calhoun cooperated with Van Buren. Democrats were hostile to national banks, and the country's bankers had joined the Whig Party. The Democratic replacement, meant to help combat the Panic of 1837, was the Independent Treasury system, which Calhoun supported and which went into effect. Calhoun, like Jackson and Van Buren, attacked finance capitalism and opposed what he saw as encroachment by government and big business. For this reason, he opposed the candidacy of Whig William Henry Harrison in the 1840 presidential election, believing that Harrison would institute high tariffs and therefore place an undue burden on the Southern economy. Calhoun resigned from the Senate on March 3, 1843, four years before the expiration of his term, and returned to Fort Hill to prepare an attempt to win the Democratic nomination for the 1844 presidential election. He gained little support, even from the South, and quit.

Secretary of State

Appointment and the Annexation of Texas 

When Harrison died in 1841 after a month in office, Vice President John Tyler succeeded him. Tyler, a former Democrat, was expelled from the Whig Party after vetoing bills passed by the Whig congressional majority to reestablish a national bank and raise tariffs. He named Calhoun Secretary of State on April 10, 1844, following the death of Abel P. Upshur, one of six people killed when a cannon exploded during a public demonstration in the USS Princeton disaster.

Upshur's loss was a severe blow to the Tyler administration. When Calhoun was nominated as Upshur's replacement, the White House was well-advanced towards securing a treaty of annexation with Texas. The State Department's secret negotiations with the Texas republic had proceeded despite explicit threats from a suspicious Mexican government that an unauthorized seizure of its northern district of Coahuila y Tejas would be equivalent to an act of war. Both the negotiations with Texas envoys and the garnering of support from the U.S. Senate had been spearheaded aggressively by Secretary Upshur, a strong pro-slavery partisan. Tyler looked to its ratification by the Senate as the sine qua non to his ambition for another term in office. Tyler planned to outflank the Whigs by gaining support from the Democratic Party or possibly creating a new party of [discontented] Northern Democrats and Southern Whigs.

Calhoun, though as avid a proponent for Texas acquisition as Upshur, posed a political liability to Tyler's aims. As secretary of state, Calhoun's political objective was to see that the presidency was placed in the hands of a southern extremist, who would put the expansion of slavery at the center of national policy.

Tyler and his allies had, since 1843, devised and encouraged national propaganda promoting Texas annexation, which understated Southern slaveholders' aspirations regarding the future of Texas. Instead, Tyler chose to portray the annexation of Texas as something that would prove economically beneficial to the nation as a whole. The further introduction of slavery into the vast expanses of Texas and beyond, they argued, would ""diffuse"" rather than concentrate slavery regionally, ultimately weakening white attachment and dependence on slave labor. This theory was yoked to the growing enthusiasm among Americans for Manifest Destiny, a desire to see the social, economic and moral precepts of republicanism spread across the continent. Moreover, Tyler declared that national security was at stake: If foreign powers—Great Britain in particular—were to gain influence in Texas, it would be reduced to a British cotton-producing reserve and a base to exert geostrategic influence over North America. Texas might be coerced into relinquishing slavery, inducing slave uprisings in adjoining slave states and deepening sectional conflicts between American free-soil and slave-soil interests. The appointment of Calhoun, with his southern states' rights reputation—which some believed was ""synonymous with slavery""—threatened to cast doubt on Tyler's carefully crafted reputation as a nationalist. Tyler, though ambivalent, felt obliged to enlist Calhoun as Secretary of State, because Tyler's closest confidantes had, in haste, offered the position to the South Carolinian statesman in the immediate aftermath of the Princeton disaster. Calhoun would be confirmed by Congress by unanimous vote.

In advance of Calhoun's arrival in Washington, D.C., Tyler attempted to quickly finalize the treaty negotiations. Sam Houston, President of the Texas Republic, fearing Mexican retaliation, insisted on a tangible demonstration of U.S. commitments to the security of Texas. When key Texas diplomats failed to appear on schedule, the delay compelled Tyler to bring his new Secretary of State directly into negotiations. Secretary Calhoun was directed to honor former Secretary Upshur's verbal assurances of protection now offered by Calhoun in writing, to provide for U.S. military intervention in the event that Mexico used force to hold Texas. Tyler deployed U.S. Navy vessels to the Gulf of Mexico and ordered army units mobilized, entirely paid for with $100,000 of executive branch contingency funds. The move side-stepped constitutional requirements that Congress authorize appropriations for war.

On April 22, 1844, Secretary Calhoun signed the treaty of annexation and ten days later delivered it to the Senate for consideration in secret session. The details of the treaty negotiations and supporting documents were leaked to the press by Senator Benjamin Tappan of Ohio. Tappan, a Democrat, was an opponent of annexation and of slavery. The terms of the Tyler–Texas treaty and the release of Calhoun's letter to British ambassador Richard Pakenham exposed the annexation campaign as a program to expand and preserve slavery. In the Pakenham letter, Calhoun alleged that the institution of slavery contributed to the physical and mental well-being of Southern slaves. The U.S. Senate was compelled to open its debates on ratification to public scrutiny, and hopes for its passage by the two-thirds majority required by the Constitution were abandoned by administration supporters. In linking Texas annexation to the expansion of slavery, Calhoun had alienated many who might previously have supported the treaty.

On June 8, 1844, after fierce partisan struggles, the Senate rejected the Tyler–Texas treaty by a vote of 16–35, a margin of more than two-to-one. The vote went largely along party lines: Whigs had opposed it almost unanimously (1–27), while Democrats split, but voted largely in favor (15–8). Nevertheless, the disclosure of the treaty placed the issue of Texas annexation at the center of the 1844 general election.

Election of 1844

At the Democratic Convention in Baltimore, Maryland in May 1844, Calhoun's supporters, with Calhoun in attendance, threatened to bolt the proceedings and shift support to Tyler's third party ticket if the delegates failed to produce a pro-Texas nominee. Calhoun's Pakenham letter, and its identification with proslavery extremism, moved the presumptive Democratic Party nominee, the northerner Martin Van Buren, into denouncing annexation. Therefore, Van Buren, already not widely popular in the South, saw his support from that region crippled. As a result, James K. Polk, a pro-Texas Jacksonian and Tennessee politician, won the nomination. Historian Daniel Walker Howe says that Calhoun's Pakenham letter was a deliberate attempt to influence the outcome of the 1844 election, writing:

In the general election, Calhoun offered his endorsement to Polk on condition that he support the annexation of Texas, oppose the Tariff of 1842, and dissolve the Washington Globe, the semi-official propaganda organ of the Democratic Party headed by Francis Preston Blair. He received these assurances and enthusiastically supported Polk's candidacy. Polk narrowly defeated Henry Clay, who opposed annexation. Lame-duck President Tyler organized a joint House–Senate vote on the Texas treaty which passed, requiring only a simple majority. He signed a bill of annexation on March 1, With President Polk's support, the Texas annexation treaty was approved by the Texas Republic in 1845. A bill to admit Texas as the 28th state of the Union was signed by Polk on December 29, 1845.

Second term in the Senate

Mexican–American War and Wilmot Proviso

Calhoun was re-elected to the Senate in 1845 following the resignation of Daniel Elliott Huger. He soon became vocally opposed to the Mexican–American War. He believed that it would distort the national character by undermining republicanism in favor of empire and by bringing non-white persons into the country. When Congress declared war against Mexico on May 13, he abstained from voting on the measure. Calhoun also vigorously opposed the Wilmot Proviso, an 1846 proposal by Pennsylvania Representative David Wilmot to ban slavery in all newly acquired territories. The House of Representatives, through its Northern majority, passed the provision several times. However, the Senate, where non-slave and slave states had more equal representation, never approved the measure.

Oregon boundary dispute
A major crisis emerged from the persistent Oregon boundary dispute between Great Britain and the United States, due to an increasing number of American migrants. The territory included most of present-day British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, and Idaho. American expansionists used the slogan ""54–40 or fight"" in reference to the Northern boundary coordinates of the Oregon territory. The parties compromised, ending the war threat, by splitting the area down the middle at the 49th parallel, with the British acquiring British Columbia and the Americans accepting Washington and Oregon. Calhoun, along with President Polk and Secretary of State James Buchanan, continued work on the treaty while he was a senator, and it was ratified by a vote of 41–14 on June 18, 1846.

Rejection of the Compromise of 1850 
The Compromise of 1850, devised by Clay and Stephen A. Douglas, a first-term Democratic senator from Illinois, was designed to solve the controversy over the status of slavery in the vast new territories acquired from Mexico. Many pro-slavery Southerners opposed it as inadequate protection for slavery, and Calhoun helped organize the Nashville Convention, which would meet in June to discuss possible Southern secession. The 67-year-old Calhoun had suffered periodic bouts of tuberculosis throughout his life. In March 1850, the disease reached a critical stage. Weeks from death and too feeble to speak, Calhoun wrote a blistering attack on the Compromise that would become his most famous speech. On March 4 a friend and disciple, Senator James Mason of Virginia, read his remarks. Calhoun affirmed the right of the South to leave the Union in response to what he called Northern subjugation, specifically the North's growing opposition to the South's ""peculiar institution"" of slavery. He warned that the day ""the balance between the two sections"" was destroyed would be a day not far removed from disunion, anarchy, and civil war. Calhoun queried how the Union might be preserved in light of subjugation of the ""weaker"" party—the pro-slavery South—by the ""stronger"" party, the anti-slavery North. He maintained that the responsibility of solving the question lay entirely on the North—as the stronger section, to allow the Southern minority an equal share in governance and to cease its anti-slavery agitation. He added:

Calhoun died soon afterward, and although the Compromise measures did eventually pass, Calhoun's ideas about states' rights attracted increasing attention across the South. Historian William Barney argues that Calhoun's ideas proved ""appealing to Southerners concerned with preserving slavery. ...Southern radicals known as 'Fire-Eaters' pushed the doctrine of states' rights to its logical extreme by upholding the constitutional right of the state to secede"".

Death, last words, and burial

Calhoun died at the Old Brick Capitol boarding house in Washington, D.C., on March 31, 1850, of tuberculosis, at the age of 68. The last words attributed to him were ""The South, the poor South!""

He was interred at St. Philip's Churchyard in Charleston, South Carolina. During the Civil War, a group of Calhoun's friends were concerned about the possible desecration of his grave by Federal troops and, during the night, removed his coffin to a hiding place under the stairs of the church. The next night, his coffin was buried in an unmarked grave near the church, where it remained until 1871 when it was again exhumed and returned to its original place.

After Calhoun had died, an associate suggested that Senator Thomas Hart Benton give a eulogy in honor of Calhoun on the floor of the Senate. Benton, a devoted Unionist, declined, saying: ""He is not dead, sir—he is not dead. There may be no vitality in his body, but there is in his doctrines.""

The Clemson University campus in South Carolina occupies the site of Calhoun's Fort Hill plantation, which he bequeathed to his wife and daughter. They sold it and its 50 slaves to a relative. When that owner died, Thomas Green Clemson foreclosed the mortgage. He later bequeathed the property to the state for use as an agricultural college to be named after him.

Calhoun's widow, Floride, died on July 25, 1866, and was buried in St. Paul's Episcopal Church Cemetery in Pendleton, South Carolina, near their children, but apart from her husband.

Political philosophy

Agrarian republicanism

Historian LeeH. Cheek, Jr., distinguishes between two strands of American republicanism: the puritan tradition, based in New England, and the agrarian or South Atlantic tradition, which Cheek argues was espoused by Calhoun. While the New England tradition stressed a politically centralized enforcement of moral and religious norms to secure civic virtue, the South Atlantic tradition relied on a decentralized moral and religious order based on the idea of subsidiarity (or localism). Cheek maintains that the ""Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions"" (1798), written by Jefferson and Madison, were the cornerstone of Calhoun's republicanism. Calhoun emphasized the primacy of subsidiarity—holding that popular rule is best expressed in local communities that are nearly autonomous while serving as units of a larger society.

Slavery
Calhoun led the pro-slavery faction in the Senate, opposing both total abolitionism and attempts such as the Wilmot Proviso to limit the expansion of slavery into the western territories.

Calhoun's father, Patrick Calhoun, helped shape his son's political views. He was a staunch supporter of slavery who taught his son that social standing depended not merely on a commitment to the ideal of popular self-government but also on the ownership of a substantial number of slaves. Flourishing in a world in which slaveholding was a hallmark of civilization, Calhoun saw little reason to question its morality as an adult. He further believed that slavery instilled in the remaining whites a code of honor that blunted the disruptive potential of private gain and fostered the civic-mindedness that lay near the core of the republican creed. From such a standpoint, the expansion of slavery decreased the likelihood for social conflict and postponed the declension when money would become the only measure of self-worth, as had happened in New England. Calhoun was thus firmly convinced that slavery was the key to the success of the American dream.

Whereas other Southern politicians had excused slavery as a ""necessary evil"", in a famous speech on the Senate floor on February 6, 1837, Calhoun asserted that slavery was a ""positive good"". He rooted this claim on two grounds: white supremacy and paternalism. All societies, Calhoun claimed, are ruled by an elite group that enjoys the fruits of the labor of a less-exceptional group. Senator William Cabell Rives of Virginia earlier had referred to slavery as an evil that might become a ""lesser evil"" in some circumstances. Calhoun believed that conceded too much to the abolitionists:

Calhoun's treatment of his own slaves includes an incident in 1831, when his slave Alick ran away when threatened with a severe whipping. Calhoun wrote to his second cousin and brother-in-law, asking him to keep a lookout for Alick, and if he was taken, to have him ""severely whipped"" and sent back.  When Alick was captured, Calhoun wrote to the captor:

Calhoun rejected the belief of Southern leaders such as Henry Clay that all Americans could agree on the ""opinion and feeling"" that slavery was wrong, although they might disagree on the most practicable way to respond to that great wrong. Calhoun's constitutional ideas acted as a viable conservative alternative to Northern appeals to democracy, majority rule, and natural rights.

As well as providing the intellectual justification of slavery, Calhoun played a central role in devising the South's overall political strategy. According to Phillips:

Shortly after delivering his speech against the Compromise of 1850, Calhoun predicted the destruction of the Union over the slavery issue. Speaking to Senator Mason, he said:

Opposition to the War with Mexico

Calhoun was consistently opposed to the War with Mexico, arguing that an enlarged military effort would only feed the alarming and growing lust of the public for empire regardless of its constitutional dangers, bloat executive powers and patronage, and saddle the republic with a soaring debt that would disrupt finances and encourage speculation. Calhoun feared, moreover, that Southern slave owners would be shut out of any conquered Mexican territories, as nearly happened with the Wilmot Proviso. He argued that the war would detrimentally lead to the annexation of all of Mexico, which would bring Mexicans into the country, whom he considered deficient in moral and intellectual terms. He said, in a speech on January 4, 1848:

Anti-slavery Northerners denounced the war as a Southern conspiracy to expand slavery; Calhoun in turn perceived a connivance of Yankees to destroy the South. By 1847 he decided the Union was threatened by a totally corrupt party system. He believed that in their lust for office, patronage and spoils, politicians in the North pandered to the anti-slavery vote, especially during presidential campaigns, and politicians in the slave states sacrificed Southern rights in an effort to placate the Northern wings of their parties. Thus, the essential first step in any successful assertion of Southern rights had to be the jettisoning of all party ties. In 1848–49, Calhoun tried to give substance to his call for Southern unity. He was the driving force behind the drafting and publication of the ""Address of the Southern Delegates in Congress, to Their Constituents"". It alleged Northern violations of the constitutional rights of the South, then warned Southern voters to expect forced emancipation of slaves in the near future, followed by their complete subjugation by an unholy alliance of unprincipled Northerners and blacks. Whites would flee and the South would ""become the permanent abode of disorder, anarchy, poverty, misery, and wretchedness"". Only the immediate and unflinching unity of Southern whites could prevent such a disaster. Such unity would either bring the North to its senses or lay the foundation for an independent South. But the spirit of union was still strong in the region and fewer than 40% of the Southern congressmen signed the address, and only one Whig.

Many Southerners believed his warnings and read every political news story from the North as further evidence of the planned destruction of the white southern way of life. The climax came a decade after Calhoun's death with the election of Republican Abraham Lincoln in 1860, which led to the secession of South Carolina, followed by six other Southern states. They formed the new Confederate States, which, in accordance with Calhoun's theory, did not have any organized political parties.

Concurrent majority

Calhoun's basic concern for protecting the diversity of minority interests is expressed in his chief contribution to political science—the idea of a concurrent majority across different groups as distinguished from a numerical majority. A concurrent majority is a system in which a minority group is permitted to exercise a sort of veto power over actions of a majority that are believed to infringe upon the minority's rights.

According to the principle of a numerical majority, the will of the more numerous citizens should always rule, regardless of the burdens on the minority. Such a principle tends toward a consolidation of power in which the interests of the absolute majority always prevail over those of the minority. Calhoun believed that the great achievement of the American constitution was in checking the tyranny of a numerical majority through institutional procedures that required a concurrent majority, such that each important interest in the community must consent to the actions of government. To secure a concurrent majority, those interests that have a numerical majority must compromise with the interests that are in the minority. A concurrent majority requires a unanimous consent of all the major interests in a community, which is the only sure way of preventing tyranny of the majority. This idea supported Calhoun's doctrine of interposition or nullification, in which the state governments could refuse to enforce or comply with a policy of the Federal government that threatened the vital interests of the states.

Historian Richard Hofstadter (1948) emphasizes that Calhoun's conception of minority was very different from the minorities of a century later:

Unlike Jefferson, Calhoun rejected attempts at economic, social, or political leveling, claiming that true equality could not be achieved if all classes were given equal rights and responsibilities. Rather, to ensure true prosperity, it was necessary for a stronger group to provide protection and care for the weaker one. This meant that the two groups should not be equal before the law. For Calhoun, ""protection"" (order) was more important than freedom. Individual rights were something to be earned, not something bestowed by nature or God. Calhoun was concerned with protecting the interests of the Southern States (which he identified with the interests of their slaveholding elites) as a distinct and beleaguered minority among the members of the federal Union; his idea of a concurrent majority as a protection for minority rights has gained some acceptance in American political thought. Political scientist Malcolm Jewell argues, ""The decision-making process in this country resembles John Calhoun's 'concurrent majority': A large number of groups both within and outside the government must, in practice, approve any major policy.""

Calhoun's ideas on the concurrent majority are illustrated in A Disquisition on Government. The Disquisition is a 100-page essay on Calhoun's definitive and comprehensive ideas on government, which he worked on intermittently for six years until its 1849 completion. It systematically presents his arguments that a numerical majority in any government will typically impose a despotism over a minority unless some way is devised to secure the assent of all classes, sections, and interests and, similarly, that innate human depravity would debase government in a democracy.

State sovereignty and the ""Calhoun Doctrine""
In the 1840s three interpretations of the constitutional powers of Congress to deal with slavery in territories emerged: the ""free-soil doctrine,"" the ""popular sovereignty position,"" and the ""Calhoun doctrine"". The Free Soilers stated that Congress had the power to outlaw slavery in the territories. The popular sovereignty position argued that the voters living there should decide. The Calhoun doctrine said that neither Congress nor the citizens of the territories could outlaw slavery in the territories.

In what historian Robert R. Russell calls the ""Calhoun Doctrine"", Calhoun argued that the Federal Government's role in the territories was only that of the trustee or agent of the several sovereign states: it was obliged not to discriminate among the states and hence was incapable of forbidding the bringing into any territory of anything that was legal property in any state. Calhoun argued that citizens from every state had the right to take their property to any territory. Congress and local voters, he asserted, had no authority to place restrictions on slavery in the territories. In a February 1847 speech before the Senate, Calhoun declared that ""the enactment of any law which should directly, or by its effects, deprive the citizens of any of the States of this Union from emigrating, with their property, in to any of the territories of the United States, will make such discrimination and would therefore be a violation of the Constitution"". Enslavers therefore had a fundamental right to take their property wherever they wished. As constitutional historian Hermann von Holst noted, ""Calhoun's doctrine made it a solemn constitutional duty of the United States government and of the American people to act as if the existence or non-existence of slavery in the Territories did not concern them in the least."" The Calhoun Doctrine was opposed by the Free Soil forces, which merged into the new Republican Party around 1854. Chief Justice Roger B. Taney used Calhoun's arguments in his decision in the 1857 Supreme Court case Dred Scott v. Sandford, in which he ruled that the federal government could not prohibit slavery in any of the territories.

Legacy

Monuments and memorials

Many different places, streets, and schools were named after Calhoun, as may be seen on the list linked above.  Some, such as Springfield, Illinois (1832) and Jackson County, Kansas (1859), were subsequently renamed.  The ""Immortal Trio"" (Calhoun, Daniel Webster, and Henry Clay) were memorialized with streets in Uptown New Orleans.

In June 2020, Clemson University removed John C. Calhoun's name from Clemson University Calhoun Honors College, renaming it to Clemson University Honors College. This action was taken in response to a petition which was supported by NFL stars DeAndre Hopkins and Deshaun Watson who are Clemson University alumni. Against the backdrop of the George Floyd protests, University chairman Smyth McKissick said that ""we must recognize there are central figures in Clemson's history whose ideals, beliefs and actions do not represent the university's core values of respect and diversity"".

The Confederate government honored Calhoun on a 1¢ postage stamp, which was printed in 1862 but was never officially released.

In 1887, at the height of the Jim Crow era, white segregationists erected a monument to Calhoun in Marion Square in Charleston, South Carolina; the base was within easy reach and the local black population defaced it. Finally, it was replaced in 1896 standing atop a column base at a total of 115 feet as well as fenced in to deter attackers. It continued as a target of vandalism regardless. The statue has been a topic of debate for a long time. In 2017, Charleston's city council deferred a proposal to put a plaque on the statue that would have stated his white-supremacist views. It was No. 5 on the Make It Right Project's 2018 list of the 10 Confederate monuments it most wanted removed. The Make It Right Project organized a protest at the monument on May 16, 2019. The monument was removed on June 24, 2020 following a unanimous vote by the Charleston City Council to relocate the monument. The removal of this monument was featured on the 5th episode in the 7th season of Southern Charm.

In 1910, the state of South Carolina gave a statue of John C. Calhoun to the National Statuary Hall Collection.

The USS JohnC. Calhoun, in commission from 1963 to 1994, was a Fleet Ballistic Missile nuclear submarine.

In 1817, surveyors sent by Secretary of War Calhoun to map the area around Fort Snelling named the largest lake in what became Minneapolis, Minnesota, for him. Two centuries later, the city of Minneapolis renamed the lake with the Dakota language name Bde Maka Ska, meaning ""White Earth Lake"" or ""White Banks Lake"". The Calhoun-Isles Community Band in the Uptown district of Minneapolis changed its name to City of Lakes Community Band in November 2018, to distance itself from Calhoun's pro-slavery legacy, following the renaming of the lake. Calhoun Square and Calhoun Beach Club both in Minneapolis announced name changes, and the road around the lake was renamed Bde Maka Ska Parkway.

Film and television
Calhoun was portrayed by actor Arliss Howard in the 1997 film Amistad. The film depicts the controversy and legal battle surrounding the status of slaves who in 1839 rebelled against their transporters on the La Amistad slave ship.

Historical reputation
Calhoun was despised by Jackson and his supporters for his alleged attempts to subvert the unity of the nation for his own political gain. On his deathbed, Jackson regretted that he had not had Calhoun executed for treason. ""My country,"" he declared, ""would have sustained me in the act, and his fate would have been a warning to traitors in all time to come."" Even after his death, Calhoun's reputation among Jacksonians remained poor. They disparaged him by portraying him as a man thirsty for power, who when he failed to attain it, sought to tear down his country with him.

According to Parton, writing in 1860:

Writing more than thirty years after Calhoun's death, James G. Blaine portrayed him as a mix of personal integrity and wrongheaded ideology:

Calhoun is often remembered for his defense of minority rights, in the context of defending white Southern interests from perceived Northern threats, by use of the ""concurrent majority"". He is also noted and criticized for his strong defense of slavery. These positions played an enormous role in influencing Southern secessionist leaders by strengthening the trend of sectionalism, thus contributing to the Civil War.
 
Biographer Irving Bartlett wrote:

Calhoun has been held in regard by some Lost Cause of the Confederacy historians, who hold a romanticized view of the antebellum Southern way of life and its cause during the Civil War. Historians such as Charles M. Wiltse and Margaret Coit have, in their writings, portrayed Calhoun as a sympathetic or heroic figure.

John Niven paints a portrait of Calhoun that is both sympathetic and tragic. He says that Calhoun's ambition and personal desires ""were often thwarted by lesser men than he"". Niven identifies Calhoun as a ""driven man and a tragic figure"". He argues that Calhoun was motivated by the near-disaster of the War of 1812, of which he was a ""thoughtless advocate,"" to work towards fighting for the freedoms and securities of the white Southern people against any kind of threat. Ultimately, Niven says, he ""... would overcompensate and in the end would more than any other individual destroy the culture he sought to preserve, perpetuating for several generations the very insecurity that had shaped his public career"".

In 1957, a five-member ""special"" committee, led by Senator John F. Kennedy, selected Calhoun as one of the five senators to enter the newly created senatorial pantheon ""hall of fame"". This ""hall of fame"" was established to fill five vacant portrait spaces in the Senate Reception Room.

Recently, Calhoun's reputation has suffered particularly due to his defense of slavery. The racially motivated Charleston church shooting in South Carolina in June 2015 reinvigorated demands for the removal of monuments dedicated to prominent pro-slavery and Confederate States figures. That month, the monument to Calhoun in Charleston was found vandalized, with spray-painted denunciations of Calhoun as a racist and a defender of slavery. Later, in 2020, during the George Floyd protests in South Carolina, the monument was vandalized with signs and spray paint, with calls from the public demanding its removal, causing the city of Charleston to erect a chain-link fence around the statue to prevent the public from accessing it, before announcing on June 23, 2020, that the statue would be removed.

In response to decades of requests, Yale President Peter Salovey announced in 2017 that the university's Calhoun College would be renamed to honor Grace Murray Hopper, a pioneering computer programmer, mathematician and Navy rear admiral who graduated from Yale. Calhoun is commemorated elsewhere on the campus, including the exterior of Harkness Tower, a prominent campus landmark, as one of Yale's ""Eight Worthies"".

History
Per Queensland Railway's classification system they were designated the A10 class, A representing they had two driving axles, and the 10 the cylinder diameter in inches. Because other locomotives also had these features, they were designated as the A10 Fairlie class. They were ordered from the Fairlie Engine Company, but were not Fairlie articulated locomotives. They were built under sub-contract by the Vulcan Foundry and both companies gave them works numbers.

The locomotives were delivered to the Central Railway (Rockhampton) in late 1877, entering service numbered 8 to 10. In March 1881, no.10 was sold only to rail contractor O'Rourke & Co, being repurchased in December 1887. In May 1888, no.8 was transferred to the Normanton Railway and renumbered no.1, with no.10 following as no.2 in December 1888 and no.9 as no.3 in June 1890.

In 1890, they were integrated into the Queensland Railways numbering list as 202-204. Two of these locos were condemned at Normanton in 1895, No.203's boiler was separated from the loco at Normanton and sent to the Clarina pump, where it remains derelict, No.204's boiler was scrapped in 1905 but the frames and wheels remained at Normanton. No.202 was sold to the Pioneer Mill (a gold ore crushing mill) near Croydon in 1906 and last used about 1915.

The A10 Fairlies were rated to haul  up a 1 in 50 (2%) grade.

Preservation
Because of the isolation of the Normanton Railway, none were scrapped. Croydon Shire Council salvaged 202 and made an assessment on restoring it.

Natural light sources in a night sky include moonlight, starlight, and airglow, depending on location and timing. Aurorae light up the skies above the polar circles. Occasionally, a large coronal mass ejection from the Sun or simply high levels of solar wind may extend the phenomenon toward the Equator.

The night sky and studies of it have a historical place in both ancient and modern cultures. In the past, for instance, farmers have used the status of the night sky as a calendar to determine when to plant crops. Many cultures have drawn constellations between stars in the sky, using them in association with legends and mythology about their deities.

The anciently developed belief of astrology is generally based on the belief that relationships between heavenly bodies influence or convey information about events on Earth. The scientific study of celestial objects visible at night takes place in the science of observational astronomy.

The visibility of celestial objects in the night sky is affected by light pollution. The presence of the Moon in the night sky has historically hindered astronomical observation by increasing the amount of ambient brightness. With the advent of artificial light sources, however, light pollution has been a growing problem for viewing the night sky. Optical filters and modifications to light fixtures can help to alleviate this problem, but for optimal views, both professional and amateur astronomers seek locations far from urban skyglow.

Brightness 

The fact that the sky is not completely dark at night, even in the absence of moonlight and city lights, can be easily observed, since if the sky were absolutely dark, one would not be able to see the silhouette of an object against the sky.

The intensity of the sky varies greatly over the day and the primary cause differs as well. During daytime when the sun is above the horizon direct scattering of sunlight (Rayleigh scattering) is the overwhelmingly dominant source of light. In twilight, the period of time between sunset and sunrise, the situation is more complicated and a further differentiation is required. Twilight is divided in three segments according to how far the sun is below the horizon in segments of 6°.

After sunset the civil twilight sets in, and ends when the sun drops more than 6° below the horizon. This is followed by the nautical twilight, when the sun reaches heights of −6° and −12°, after which comes the astronomical twilight defined as the period from −12° to −18°. When the sun drops more than 18° below the horizon, the sky generally attains its minimum brightness.

Several sources can be identified as the source of the intrinsic brightness of the sky, namely airglow,  indirect scattering of sunlight, scattering of starlight, and artificial light pollution.

Visual presentation 

Depending on local sky cloud cover, pollution, humidity, and light pollution levels, the stars visible to the unaided naked eye appear as hundreds, thousands or tens of thousands of white pinpoints of light in an otherwise near black sky together with some faint nebulae or clouds of light.  In ancient times the stars were often assumed to be equidistant on a dome above the earth because they are much too far away for stereopsis to offer any depth cues.  Visible stars range in color from blue (hot) to red (cold), but with such small points of faint light, most look white because they stimulate the rod cells without triggering the cone cells.  If it is particularly dark and a particularly faint celestial object is of interest, averted vision may be helpful.

The stars of the night sky cannot be counted unaided because they are so numerous and there is no way to track which have been counted and which have not.  Further complicating the count, fainter stars may appear and disappear depending on exactly where the observer is looking.  The result is an impression of an extraordinarily vast star field.

Because stargazing is best done from a dark place away from city lights, dark adaptation is important to achieve and maintain.  It takes several minutes for eyes to adjust to the darkness necessary for seeing the most stars, and surroundings on the ground are hard to discern.  A red flashlight (torch) can be used to illuminate star charts, telescope parts, and the like without undoing the dark adaptation.  (See Purkinje effect).

Constellations 
There are no markings on the night sky, though there exist many sky maps to aid stargazers in identifying constellations and other celestial objects.  Constellations are prominent because their stars tend to be brighter than other nearby stars in the sky.  Different cultures have created different groupings of constellations based on differing interpretations of the more-or-less random patterns of dots in the sky.  Constellations were identified without regard to distance to each star, but instead as if they were all dots on a dome.

Orion is among the most prominent and recognizable constellations.  The Big Dipper (which has a wide variety of other names) is helpful for navigation in the northern hemisphere because it points to Polaris, the north star.

The pole stars are special because they are approximately in line with the Earth's axis of rotation so they appear to stay in one place while the other stars rotate around them through the course of a night (or a year).

Planets 
Planets, named for the Greek word for ""wanderer,"" process through the starfield a little each day, executing loops with time scales dependent on the length of the planet's year or orbital period around the Sun.  Planets, to the naked eye, appear as points of light in the sky with variable brightness. Planets shine due to sunlight reflecting or scattering from the planets' surface or atmosphere. Thus, the relative sun-planet-earth positions determine the planet's brightness. With a telescope or good binoculars, the planets appear as discs demonstrating finite size, and it is possible to observe orbiting moons which cast shadows onto the host planet's surface. Venus is the most prominent planet, often called the ""morning star"" or ""evening star"" because it is brighter than the stars and often the only ""star"" visible near sunrise or sunset, depending on its location in its orbit. Because of its brightness, Venus can sometimes be seen after sunrise. Mercury, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn are also visible to the naked eye in the night sky.

The Moon 
Earth's Moon appears as a grey disc in the sky with cratering visible to the naked eye.  It spans, depending on its exact location, 29–33 arcminutes – which is about the size of a thumbnail at arm's length, and is readily identified. Over 29.53 days on average, the moon goes through a full cycle of lunar phases.  People can generally identify phases within a few days by looking at the moon.  Unlike stars and most planets, the light reflected from the moon is bright enough to be seen during the day.

Some of the most spectacular moons come during the full moon phase near sunset or sunrise.  The moon on the horizon benefits from the moon illusion which makes it appear larger.  The light reflected from the moon traveling through the atmosphere also colors the moon orange and/or red.

Comets 
Comets come to the night sky only rarely.  Comets are illuminated by the sun, and their tails extend away from the sun.  A comet with a visible tail is quite unusual – a great comet appears about once a decade.  They tend to be visible only shortly before sunrise or after sunset because those are the times they are close enough to the sun to show a tail.

Clouds
Clouds obscure the view of other objects in the sky, though varying thicknesses of cloud cover have differing effects.  A very thin cirrus cloud in front of the moon might produce a rainbow-colored ring around the moon.  Stars and planets are too small or dim to take on this effect and are instead only dimmed (often to the point of invisibility).  Thicker cloud cover obscures celestial objects entirely, making the sky black or reflecting city lights back down. Clouds are often close enough to afford some depth perception, though they are hard to see without moonlight or light pollution.

Other objects 

On clear dark nights in unpolluted areas, when the moon is thin or below the horizon, the Milky Way, a band of what looks like white dust, can be seen.

The Magellanic Clouds of the southern sky are easily mistaken to be Earth-based clouds (hence the name) but are in fact collections of stars found outside the Milky Way known as dwarf galaxies.

Zodiacal light is a glow that appears near the points where the sun rises and sets, and is caused by sunlight interacting with interplanetary dust.

Gegenschein is a faint bright spot in the night sky centered at the antisolar point, caused by the backscatter of sunlight by interplanetary dust.

Shortly after sunset and before sunrise, artificial satellites often look like starssimilar in brightness and sizebut move relatively quickly. Those that fly in low Earth orbit cross the sky in a couple of minutes. Some satellites, including space debris, appear to blink or have a periodic fluctuation in brightness because they are rotating. Satellite flares can appear brighter than Venus, with notable examples including the International Space Station (ISS) and Iridium Satellites.

Meteors (commonly known as shooting stars) streak across the sky very infrequently. During a meteor shower, they may average one a minute at irregular intervals, but otherwise their appearance is a random surprise. The occasional meteor will make a bright, fleeting streak across the sky, and they can be very bright in comparison to the night sky.

Aircraft are also visible at night, distinguishable at a distance from other objects because their navigation lights blink.

Weinbaum originally published in the February 1935 issue of Astounding Stories.  It was Weinbaum's fourth published story, and the first to be set on Venus.  He quickly followed it up with a sequel called ""The Lotus Eaters"".

Weinbaum's Venus 
In the story, tidal locking keeps one side of Venus perpetually facing the Sun.  This side of the planet is a barren desert.  Towards the planet's twilight region the temperature drops below the boiling point of water and the Hotlands begin: an area of the planet inhabited by native life forms, all of them parasitic to a greater or lesser degree.  ""A thousand different species, but all the same in one respect; each of them was all appetite.  In common with most Venusian beings, they had a multiplicity of both legs and mouths; in fact, some of them were little more than blobs of skin split into dozens of hungry mouths, crawling on a hundred spidery legs.""  The air of the Hotlands is hazy with spores which instantly infest any life-form unfortunate enough to have its skin pierced, and at the top of the Venusian food chain is the doughpot, a mass of fast-moving undifferentiated protoplasm that absorbs every living thing in its path, and whose touch is fatal to humans.

Close to the terminator a constant wind from the night side of Venus brings the temperature below 80 degrees Fahrenheit, too cold for the spores and most of the other Hotlands' life.  This is the Cool Country, where most of the planet's human settlers live.  At the terminator itself, the lower wind from the night side meets a hot upper wind from the day side, resulting in a permanent violent thunderstorm.  The precipitation from that storm falls as snow on the night side of the terminator, forming a vast ice barrier which slumps under its own weight into the dayside, then melts into rivers that flow away from the terminator until they evaporate in the growing heat.

It is revealed in a later story, ""The Planet of Doubt"", that the United States had attempted to lay claim to all of Venus.  The Council of Bern ruled in 2059 that planetary explorers could only lay claim to as much of a planet as they had explored.  As a result, the United States was only able to establish a claim to a quarter of the habitable zone of Venus, with the other three quarters being occupied by the United Kingdom, France, and the Netherlands.

Plot summary

Hamilton ""Ham"" Hammond is an American trader who lives in the Venusian Hotlands in the late 21st century.  He makes his living collecting xixtchil spore-pods from the native Venusians, which are used to make a rejuvenation drug on Earth.  When Hammond's shack is sucked under the surface by a mud-spout, he must make his way across 200 miles of hot, humid, hostile Venusian jungle to reach Erotia, a settlement in the American part of the planet.

Hammond comes upon a human dwelling which, contrary to custom, is locked.  He forces his way inside and is confronted by Patricia Burlingame, daughter of the late British explorer Patrick Burlingame.  As Hammond is in the British part of Venus, Burlingame denounces him as a poacher.  A confrontation between the two is interrupted by the arrival of a doughpot which wrecks Burlingame's dwelling.  The two grudgingly set aside their differences and travel west to the Cool Country, saving each other's lives on several occasions.  Their truce ends when Hammond wakes to find that Burlingame has emptied his xixtchil pods onto the ground, exposing them to the destructive spores.  Now destitute, Hammond angrily sets off north toward Erotia, leaving Burlingame to make her way south through the impassable Mountains of Eternity to the British settlement of Venoble alone.

After a time, Hammond suffers an attack of conscience, turns, and follows Burlingame south.  He catches up with her in the foothills of the Eternities just before a huge doughpot traps them in a box canyon.  Hammond is able to get off two shots of his flame pistol at the doughpot before the barrel shatters, reducing the thing's size but still leaving them trapped.  They decide to go deeper into the box canyon, but in the darkness they are set upon by Triops noctivivans, vicious nightside-dwelling cousins of the Venusians.  The trioptes drive them back toward the doughpot, dosing Burlingame with a soporific drug that renders her unconscious.  Hammond is forced to make his way past the doughpot on a low, narrow shelf of rock while carrying Burlingame.

The two make it past the doughpot; when the pursuing trioptes arrive, they stop chasing the humans and start eating the doughpot instead.  When Burlingame revives, she admits that instead of destroying the xixtchil pods, she had actually stolen them.  She returns them to Hammond, and agrees to come with him to Erotia.  She also agrees to marry him.

The hotel features 49 rooms alongside a Par 3 Champion golf course, restaurant, and leisure and conference facilities. The venue also hosts weddings and entertainment events.

History

Built in 1640, Nailcote Hall was completed just before the start of the English Civil War. Its name is believed to be derived from the Norman-French word for armourer. The house was damaged during the war by Cromwell’s troops before the assault on Kenilworth Castle, but subsequently restored after a repair bill was honoured by the Parliamentarians. The Lant family made Nailcote Hall their home for some 300 years, and during this time the property saw many alterations, including a Georgian wing which was added in 1780. When restoration work was carried out more recently, a priest hole was discovered in what is now the Oak Room restaurant.

Nailcote Hall first opened to the public in 1984, and a new extension, completed in 1989, added on additional bedrooms, a function room and a library. The present owner acquired Nailcote Hall in 1991 and subsequently built the leisure complex which forms part of the hotel today.

Features

Golf course
Nailcote Hall’s 9-hole Cromwell golf course is open members, hotel guests and visitors. It hosts both the Open Par 3 Championship and the British Par 3 Championship.

Leisure and event facilities
The Leisure and Country Club has an indoor 14-metre Roman bath-style swimming pool, steam room, jacuzzi and gymnasium, and an outdoor running track. The grounds also include a croquet lawn and petanque area, and residents have access to tennis facilities at the nearby Berkswell Tennis Club.

The venue can hold over 250 guests in the marquee, and weddings are held at the Country House Hotel throughout the year.  The venue runs a yearly ""Bride of The Year"" competition, where the winner receives a free Wedding Reception up to the value of £5,000.

Nailcote Hall hosts conferencing events, sporting dinners, charity events and balls in Rick's Bar and the Marquee.  There is also a restaurant on site (The Oak Room) for guests and external visitors.

The novel deals with date rape, and father/daughter relationships. The novel heavily references Dante Alighieri's Inferno.

Plot
When freshman Trixie Stone accuses her ex-boyfriend, Jason Underhill, of raping her at a party, students and townspeople, alike, are quick to take Jason's side when he claims that their intercourse was consensual. Trixie's parents, Daniel, a mild-mannered comic book artist from a rough upbringing, and Laura, a college professor having an affair with one of her students, become involved, and Jason, whose life is supposedly ruined by Trixie's accusation, leaps from a bridge, dying by suicide. Although Jason's death was first presumed to be suicide, Trixie is quickly turned to as a suspect, accused of pushing Jason off the bridge. Trixie then flees to the Yup'ik region of Alaska where her father grew up. Daniel and Laura eventually find Trixie in Alaska.

At the end of the novel, Laura confesses to Daniel that she was present when Jason died. Jason, who was intoxicated, lunged at Laura because Trixie, her daughter was ruining his life. Laura pushed Jason off the bridge but he held onto her. Laura reached to his hand, but then let go, thus revealing that Trixie is innocent, but Laura is not. The novel concludes with the final chapter with Daniel's latest comic, showing a father reunited with his daughter, after saving her from the depths of hell.  

The main plot and subplots are juxtaposed throughout the book with Daniel's latest comic, entitled The Tenth Circle, which parallels with Daniel's life and the novel itself. 

In the comic, inserted into the book, there's a hidden message. The message, “Nothing is easier than self-deceit, for what each man wishes that he also believes to be true” – DEMOSTHENES

Title 
The title, The Tenth Circle, is a reference to the first canticle, Inferno, of The Divine Comedy by Dante.

Main characters 
Trixie Stone: Protagonist, ninth-grade high school student, who accuses Jason Underhill of rape. 

Daniel Stone: Trixie's father, a comic-book artist from Alaska.

Early life and education
Broca was born in Bucharest. The Broca family immigrated to Montreal, Canada in 1962. There, she attended and graduated from Northmount High School in 1964. She began drawing and painting at an early age and won several artistic awards before she enrolled in the BFA programme at Sir George Williams University (now Concordia University). Broca graduated with honours in 1968. She became a Canadian citizen in 1967. In 1969, Broca received a Bourse de Perfectionnement from the Quebec Government to study abroad. She enrolled in the Graduate Fine Arts programme at Pratt Institute in New York City, graduating with an MFA (honours) in 1971. That year she married David Goodman in Montreal and together they relocated to Vancouver BC.

Career

Teaching
Broca taught at Douglas College (later named Kwantlen College and presently Kwantlen Polytechnic University) for 15 years as well as being a guest lecturer at the University of British Columbia, Simon Fraser University and the Okanagan School of the Arts.

In 2000 Broca collaborated with Canadian author/poet Joy Kogawa on the book A Song of Lilith, based on the legend of Lilith, an ancient Hebrew mythological figure. Kogawa's text and  Broca's images were incorporated into a concert/performance directed by Kristine Bogyo with classical composer Larysa Kuzmenko, writer Joy Kogawa, actor Moira Wylie, and five classical music performers. The premiere of the concert opened in Toronto at the St. Lawrence Centre for The Arts in Sept. 2000; the following year it was performed in various cities across Canada.

In 2015  Broca was appointed as a Jack and Doris Shadbolt Community Scholar, a subset of the Shadbolt Fellow in Graduate Liberal Studies at Simon Fraser University. In 2017  Broca was appointed as a member of the Advisory Board for Mosaic Research Center at Uludağ University, Bursa, Turkey.

Documentary
Broca was the subject of the documentary film Return to Byzantium: The Art and Life of Lilian Broca, which premiered in Canada at The National Library and Archives in Ottawa in 2012. Director and producer Adelina Suvagau led the Canadian/Romanian co-production which spanned over a five-year period. The documentary was selected for participation in five International Film Festivals in the US and in Canada, including the San Pedro International Film Festival, where it won the Best Documentary Award in 2012. The film was acquired by CBC (Canadian Broadcasting Corporation) television network and first aired on July 20, 2013.

Artistic practice
Broca's early works were representational. In the 1970s Broca experimented with various abstract styles, held exhibitions in Vancouver and  received several commissions from the city of Vancouver and Kwantlen College for large painted murals.

At the beginning of the 1980s she began a more realistic phase. Although at a time representational art was not in vogue, Broca persisted and her works, which dealt with human relationships, were exhibited across Canada, including in Regina.

In the 1990s Broca's work showed more emphasis on social issues, particularly women's  issues. The  Vancouver Art Gallery purchased Broca's work and the-then director Brooks Joyner commented: Lilian Broca is an accomplished artist,  a superb draughtsman, who knows about art history. ...a committed artist  producing a significant body of work....She is discovering things in our  present and past that are keys to understanding heroics in life. At the end of that decade, a solo exhibition was held at the Frye Art Museum in Seattle, Washington.

In 2002 Broca changed  her medium from paint and canvas to glass mosaics. She began to create large  scale mosaics using historical iconography and materials such as Byzantine  smalti, gold smalti and millefiori on honeycomb aluminum panels. She took inspiration from the courageous acts of biblical women. A book about her work, The Hidden and  the Revealed: The Esther Mosaics of Lilian Broca, by Sheila D. Campbell, Yosef Wosk, Gareth Sirotnik  and Broca was published in 2011. The book describes how her art gives ""voice, form and personality"" to these women and their stories.

IDEA became the key provider of training on constitutional issues to Myanmar's government, political parties, and the Constitutional Court. It maintained an office embedded in the Union Electoral Commission and offered technical assistance to the Commission. In 2019 IDEA opened an office embedded in Parliament where it offered technical assistance on public finance. 

In 2020 McDowell joined the Asia Foundation as Country Representative.

Education
Attracted by its ""counterculture atmosphere"", McDowell attended Innis College at the University of Toronto. He received a MA from University of Toronto in East Asian Studies in 1988. In 2018 he attended the Kennedy School of Government as a Fulbright Scholar, earning a Master of Public Administration, and stayed on as a visiting Research Scholar at the Ash Institute for Democratic Governance and Innovation.

Public Diplomacy and E-diplomacy
McDowell is known as an innovator in public diplomacy and e-diplomacy. Canada's Globe and Mail credits him with ""helping drag the Department of Foreign Affairs into the Internet age"", and Canada's former Ambassador to China called him ""among the most original of thinkers when it comes to using social media"".

E-diplomacy
Ambassador McDowell is a frequent speaker and participant in e-diplomacy conferences, offering a practitioners perspective. In 2015 he spoke at events organized by the foreign ministries of Armenia and the Netherlands.

He is known for starting Canada's social media presence in China with ""canadaweibo"" on the Chinese Sina Weibo platform. Canadaweibo grew from zero to 400,000 followers within two years, becoming the second largest and most influential embassy site in China after the USA's. Similarly, he made social media a priority during his posting in Myanmar. In an interview with Mizzima News, he explains that social media was prioritized because the embassy was ""starting late, and from scratch, with small budgets. The only way we could compete with other embassies for the attention of the Myanmar people was through cyberspace.""  By the time McDowell finished his term, the embassy's Facebook page had over 300,000 followers, making it by far the largest Canadian Embassy page in the world.

Since his term ended in September 2016, he started a new page to detail his post-diplomatic life `X-Ambassador to Myanmar, Mark McDowell'.

McDowell's work in e-government is longstanding. He gave the government of Canada's address to the United Nations World Summit on the Information Society in 2002. At that time he also took a leading role in initiatives in Canada related to getting Aboriginal communities online, and disseminating news about the international activities of Canadian Aboriginal peoples.

Public Diplomacy
McDowell has worked on public diplomacy throughout his diplomatic career, and was a Director of Public Diplomacy and Domestic Outreach in Canada’s Department of Foreign Affairs.
 
He wrote a brief primer on public diplomacy based on a talk he delivered at the 100th Anniversary Edward R. Murrow Memorial Conference at the Fletcher School for Law and Diplomacy (see www.fletcherforum.org/2012/07/26/32-3/). In a 2010 talk at the Fletcher School on the connection between domestic outreach and public diplomacy abroad, he coined the concept of ""Total Diplomacy"", engaging and partnering with segments of the domestic audience to achieve foreign policy goals. McDowell has been connected with ""panda diplomacy"" for his work in bringing a pair of Chinese pandas to Canada, and ""sports diplomacy"" for his public diplomacy in Myanmar connected with the traditional Burmese sport of chinlone.

A conversation with McDowell forms one of the chapters of Chinese public diplomacy thinker Zhao Qizheng's 2012 book ""The Wisdom of Public Diplomacy: Cross-Border Dialogues"".

Diplomatic career

Myanmar
McDowell was named Canada's first ever resident ambassador to Myanmar in March 2013. Because of the long period of sanctions imposed by Canada on Myanmar, the relationship between the two countries was very limited and cold.

Since taking up his job in June 2013, relations have warmed considerably, with Canada naming Myanmar a priority country for both trade and aid and opening a visa office. Ambassador McDowell has focused much of his attention on supporting grassroots democracy and human rights organizations working on issues such as freedom of speech and voter and civic education. Canada has also started to cooperate on security related issues like border management and prevention of human trafficking.

He has staked out a leading role for Canada in the area of federalism and minority rights, and in the promotion of LGBTIQ rights in this laboratory for democracy. ""Pride abroad Canada’s support of LGBTIQ activism in Asia"" describes Canada's leading role in supporting the nascent LGBTIQ movement in Myanmar, and McDowell's high profile as a supportive Ambassador.

The Embassy of Canada has had success in rapidly raising Canada's public profile in Myanmar, through both traditional and social media. Its Facebook presence has over 300,000 followers on its Burmese, English, and French pages. The English language page has the highest following of any Canadian Embassy page in the world.

China
McDowell served in Beijing from 2010-2013.

Thailand
McDowell was head of the political section in Thailand from 2003-2007. He managed the Embassy throughout the Indian Ocean Tsunami crisis. During his term in Thailand, there was significant unrest in the south of the country, attributed to Muslim terrorist groups. McDowell led Canada's engagement in this region.

McDowell began his work on LGBTIQ issues with his support for the First International Asian Gay and Lesbian Studies Conference in Bangkok in 2005, where he spoke on the topic of marriage equality.

Aboriginal Affairs
McDowell was deputy Director for Aboriginal Affairs in the Global Issues Bureau from 2001-2003.

Taiwan
McDowell served in Taipei from 1997-2001.

It is part of Wexford GAA. It is three miles (5 km) north of Wexford town and runs for approximately 11 miles (18 km) across like a figure eight. The parish consists of the two half parishes of Crossabeg and Ballymurn. The club takes the name of the parishes in which it is based (Parishes of County Wexford Ireland).

Early history
GAA games have been played in the two half parishes of Crossabeg and Ballymurn since 1886, but the two areas operated independently of one another for the first eighty years of Gaelic games, as each parish had its own team.
The club contested the first Wexford senior football final of 1886 losing to Rosslare. The club won the senior football final of 1897.

The first hurling highlight was in 1891 when Crossabeg-Ballymurn was Wexford's representative in the All Ireland championship which was lost Ballyduff after extra time. That was Kerry's only All Ireland hurling championship success.

The first two decades of the 20th century brought the area to hurling prominence and also proved to be a golden era for the parish as far as the top hurling honours were concerned.
Ballymurn recorded a first county title when winning the junior hurling championship of 1908 and this was quickly followed by senior success in 1910 and 1911. Crossabeg captured the Junior hurling title of 1914 and Ballymurn won it for the second time in 1916. Crossabeg were senior hurling champions in 1918 which was the last title they won as a separate club.
Ballymurn won the minor hurling championship of 1929 which was quickly followed by an Intermediate hurling title in 1930. They played senior hurling in the early 1930s and during that time they won the Echo Shield an important competition of that era.

Ballymurn then followed Crossabeg back into the junior grade where both half parishes operated for over 30 years very much independent of each other with little if any inter change of players.
There were no titles won and in some years a team might not be fielded at all, resulting in players throwing in their lot with neighbouring perishes, but never together.
The names of players from the Crossabeg and Ballymurn parishes are to be found playing with other teams in the surrounding areas such as Sallybeachers, Ardcolm, New Irelands, Oylegate, Glenbrien, Shelmaliers, Glynn and the Faythe Harriers throughout this period.

Current Club
As the clubs entered the 1960s a number of people led by Michael Sinnott and Cauley Gordan decided it was time to unite under one club to serve the area and so in 1966 the present day Crossabeg Ballymurn  came into being.

The new club entered a team in the junior championship but it took a number of years to gain any semblance of success.

In the early 1970s championship success was halted by St Fintains in the Wexford District final for three years in a row . In 1972 a first Wexford district junior hurling title was won when they beat St Fintans in the final. The club went on to contest its first county final that year losing out to Cloughbawn in the final.

Despite the loss the ambition of the club was aroused and in the following year a restructuring of hurling in the county saw the club opting to go up to the Intermediate grade which would lead to a 15-year quest filled with heartache and disappointment as the club sought to win its first adult title as a one parish club.

They contested the 1974 intermediate final losing on a replay to Gorey. They were beaten semi finalists in 1976, and were beaten in the final of 1977 by a rising St Martins side.
For the next ten years the club was always listed as one of the seasons fancied sides but the breakthrough never came.

In the meantime at underage level the club lost the 1973 minor hurling final to Rathnure / Duffry Rovers when teamed up with neighbours Oylegate. Two years later they won the U21 hurling title when joined with the Shelmaliers beating Gorey in the final.
In 1980 they united with Oylegate to win the Minor B hurling, beating ferns in the final, and again won the U21 hurling in 1982, beating a star-studded Rathnure / Cushinstown in the final. The club went it alone in 1986 and captured the U21B hurling title.
The underage teams of the early 1980s contained the players who would carry the club forward into the 1990s.

The tale of woe in adult finals  continued in 1984 when Gorey beat the junior B hurlers in the final.
In 1985 it was the junior B footballers who beat Castletown in the final to record a first adult success in football after all the effort to win a hurling title. However, as in the previous century the win signaled a change of fortune.
The Intermediate hurlers contested a first final in ten years when they lost the 1987 final to near neighbours Glynn / Barntown. The club was back the following year to beat Shamrocks in the final and to record a first adult hurling success in the parish for fifty eight years. This victory also saw the parish return to the top  senior grade of Wexford hurling.

The club more than held its own at senior level and in 1994 narrowly lost the senior semi final to Oulart/ Ballagh who went on to record their own first senior win. At underage level in 1994 the club contested its first premier minor hurling final as a single club losing out to Rathnure.
In 1995 the junior B hurlers won the final at the third attempt beating the Rapparees in the final having lost the 1989 final to Bannow / Ballymitty. This was the high tide mark of the club as each year that followed saw a gradual slippage until in 2000 the club was relegated from senior ranks. Worse was to follow when in 2003 saw the team relegated to junior ranks for the first time in thirty years.

The years since 2003 has seen the club founder in the junior ranks, and  has been a traumatic time for all involved as every one adjusted to their new status.
Out of recent disappointment has come  a renewed focus and determination to climb the hurling ladder once again however long it takes.
The club reached the junior hurling final of 2006 where they lost by a point to Our Lady's Island . Six members of the 2000 U12 hurling winning team were members of the 2006 junior hurling panel.
In 2008 the club were knocked out of the junior championship but went on to claim the junior shield when beating Geraldine O'Hanrahans, their first adult cup in thirteen years.

Planning for the future at underage
The club has enjoyed some success at underage level in the 1990s when they won 5 titles at various grades and over the seven years of the new century have added a further seven titles from u12 level up, including a first underage football title for the U12's.

The underage players are starting to flow into the adult teams and there is a good feeling  about the future again and as ever in Crossabeg Ballymurn success is not immediate but there is a determination to work hard at it, and to carry on the tradition of Gaelic games in the parish into a third century.

History
First called Incochee, it was purchased in 1824 by Hezekiah and Ann Graham Ponder. Hezekiah and Ann are buried in a cemetery near U.S. 319.

During the antebellum years the land was owned by John Miller and totaled . During the 1890s, the very wealthy Hanna family, owners of the M. A. Hanna Company, had been visiting Thomasville, Georgia regularly like many northern wealthy people. During the latter 1890s, the Hannas' crossed the Florida border and began purchasing land in Leon County.

Sydney E. Hutchinson of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania purchased the land to be called Foshalee Plantation between 1910 and 1914. The land lay west of Foshalee Slough, a swampy lowland extending from the eastern edge of Lake Iamonia. The purchase was for several miles of property to the east of the lake as well as to the north and south. Eventually Hutchinson would extend Foshalee to .

Between the late 1910s and early 1920s, Hutchinson sold Foshalee to Harry Payne Whitney,  a wealthy yachtsman and horse breeder. Whitney died October 26, 1930 and his wife, Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney, great granddaughter of Commodore Cornelius Vanderbilt. kept Foshalee in operation until 1938. That year Mrs. Whitney sold the  Foshalee to Mrs. F. Ambrose Clark of Westbury, Long Island, New York for $190,000. Mrs. Clark kept the property until 1949 after she was thrown by a horse which had stumbled into a nest of yellow jackets.

After Mrs. Clark, Foshalee then became a joint ownership of property between Robert Livingston Ireland, Jr. and David S. Ingalls of Cleveland, Ohio. Ingalls was a director of Pan Am World Airways and publisher of the Cincinnati Times-Star. Ireland was an executive with M.A. Hanna Company, an extensive and powerful coal company. The Ingalls and Ireland families shared Foshalee equally as well as their properties of Ring Oak Plantation and Chemonie Plantation.

By 1966, Foshalee reported it had 5 tractors with  under cultivation, 500 of which were corn, 60 growing peanuts, and  left for dove.

According to the World Bank, more than 850 million Chinese people have been lifted out of extreme poverty; China's poverty rate fell from 88 percent in 1981 to 0.7 percent in 2015, as measured by the percentage of people living on the equivalent of US$1.90 or less per day in 2011 purchasing price parity terms,which still stands in 2022.Chinese definition of extreme poverty is more stringent than that of World Bank, and is defined as earning less than $2.30 a day at purchasing power parity (PPP),Since the start of far-reaching economic reforms in the late 1970s, growth has fuelled a substantial increase in per-capita income lifting people out of extreme poverty. China's per capita income has increased fivefold between 1990 and 2000, from $200 to $1,000. Between 2000 and 2010, per capita income also rose by the same rate, from $1,000 to $5,000, moving China into the ranks of middle-income countries. Between 1990 and 2005, China's progress accounted for more than three-quarters of global poverty reduction and was largely responsible for the world reaching the UN millennium development target of dividing extreme poverty in half. This can be attributed to a combination of a rapidly expanding labour market, driven by a protracted period of economic growth, and a series of government transfers such as an urban subsidy, and the introduction of a rural pension. The World Bank Group said that the percentage of the population living below the international poverty line of $1.9 (2011 PPP) fell to 0.7 percent in 2015, and poverty line of $3.2 (2011 PPP) fell to 7% in 2015.At the end of 2018, the number of people living below China's national poverty line of ¥2,300 (CNY) per year (in 2010 constant prices) was 16.6 million, equal to 1.7% of the population at the time. 

On November 23, 2020, China announced that it had eliminated absolute poverty nationwide by uplifting all of its citizens beyond its set ¥2,300 per year (in 2010 constant prices), or around ¥4,000 per year in 2020. The World Bank has different poverty lines for countries with different gross national income (GNI). With an GNI per capita of $ 10,610 in 2020,China is an upper middle-income country. The poverty line for an upper middle-income country is $5.5 per day at PPP. As of 2020, China has succeeded in eradicating absolute poverty, but not the poverty defined for upper middle-income countries which China belongs to. China still has around 13% of its population falling below this poverty line of $5.50 per day in 2020. Chinese premier Li Keqiang said in May 2020 that 40% of Chinese people earn an average of ¥1,000 CNY (around $150) a month (measured at the exchange rate,  not at PPP).

Overview
Since Deng Xiaoping began instituting market reforms in the late 1970s, China has been among the most rapidly growing economies in the world, regularly exceeding 15 percent GDP growth annually. This growth has led to a substantial increase in real living standards and a marked decline in poverty. Between 1981 and 2008, the proportion of China's population living on less than $1.25/day is estimated to have fallen from 85% to 13.1%, meaning that roughly 600 million people were taken out of extreme poverty. At the same time, this rapid change has brought with it different kinds of stresses. China faces serious natural resource scarcity and environmental degradation. It has also seen growing disparities as people in different parts of the country and with different characteristics have benefited from the growth at different rates.

Starting from the pre-reform situation, some increase in income inequality was inevitable, as favored coastal urban locations benefited from the opening policy, and as the small stock of educated people found new opportunities. However, particular features of Chinese policy may have exacerbated rather than mitigated growing disparities. The household registration (hukou) system kept rural-urban migration below what it otherwise would have been, and contributed to the development of one of the largest rural-urban income divides in the world. Weak tenure over rural land also limited the ability of peasants to benefit from their primary asset.

Aside from income inequality, there has also been an increase in inequality of educational outcomes and health status, partly the result of China's uniquely decentralized fiscal system, in which local government has been primarily responsible for funding basic health and education. Poor localities have not been able to fund these services, and poor households have not been able to afford the high private cost of basic education and healthcare.

The large trade surplus that has emerged in China has exacerbated the inequalities, and makes them harder to address. The trade surplus stimulates the urban manufacturing sector, which is already relatively well off. It limits the government's scope to increase funding for public services such as rural health and education. The government has been trying to rebalance China's production away from investment and exports towards domestic consumption and services, to improve the country's long-term macroeconomic health and the situation of the relatively poor in China.

Recent government measures to reduce disparities include relaxation of the hukou system, abolition of the agricultural tax, and increased central transfers to fund health and education in rural areas.

Poverty reduction

China has maintained a high growth rate for more than 30 years since the beginning of economic reform in 1978, this sustained growth has generated a huge increase in average living standards. 25 years ago, China had many characteristics in common with the rest of developing Asia: large population, low per capita income, and resource scarcity on a per capita basis. But in the 15 years from 1990 to 2005, China averaged per capita growth of 8.7%

The whole reform program is often referred to in brief as the ""open door policy"". This highlights that a key component of Chinese reform has been trade liberalization and opening up to foreign direct investment, but not opening the capital account more generally to portfolio flows. China improved its human capital, opened up to foreign trade and investment, and created a better investment climate for the private sector.

After joining the WTO China's average tariffs have dropped below 100%, and to around 5% for manufactured imports. It initially welcomed foreign investment into ""special economic zones"". Some of these zones were very large, amounting to urban areas of 20 million people or more. The positive impact of foreign investment in these locations led to a more general opening up of the economy to foreign investment, with the result that China became the largest recipient of direct investment flows in the 1990s.

The opening up measures have been accompanied by improvements in the investment climate. Particularly in the coastal areas, cities have developed their investment climates. In these cities, the private sector accounts for 90% or more of manufacturing assets and production. In 2005, the average pretax rate of return for domestic private firms was the same as that for foreign-invested firms. Local governments in coastal cities have lowered loss of output due to unreliable power supply to 1.0% and customs clearance time for imports has been lowered in Chinese cities to 3.3 days.

China's sustained growth fueled historically unprecedented poverty reduction. The World Bank uses a poverty line based on household real consumption (including consumption of own-produced crops and other goods), set at $1 per day measured at Purchasing Power Parity. In most low-income countries this amount is sufficient to guarantee each person about 1000 calories of nutrition per day, plus other basic necessities. In 2007, this line corresponds to about 2,836 RMB per year. Based on household surveys, the poverty rate in China in 1981 was 63% of the population. This rate declined to 10% in 2004, indicating that about 500 million people have climbed out of poverty during this period.

This poverty reduction has occurred in waves. The shift to the household responsibility system propelled a large increase in agricultural output, and poverty was cut in half over the short period from 1981 to 1987. From 1987 to 1993 poverty reduction stagnated, then resumed again. From 1996 to 2001 there was once more relatively little poverty reduction. Since China joined the WTO in 2001, however, poverty reduction resumed at a very rapid rate, and poverty was cut by a third in just three years.

Taken from the Asian Development Bank, there was an estimated average annual growth rate of 0.5% in China between 2010 and 2015. This brought the Chinese population to 1.37 billion in 2015. As per China's national poverty line, 8.5 percent of people were in poverty in 2013, which decreased to 1.7 percent in 2018.

On 6 March 2020, Xi Jinping, the General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, announced that by 2020, China will achieve all poverty alleviation in rural areas. On 28 May 2020, Li Keqiang, the Premier of China, said that ""China has over 600 million people whose monthly income is barely 1,000 yuan (USD 140) and their lives have further been affected by the coronavirus pandemic.""

Universal Healthcare
Michelle Bachelet visited China in May 2022, the first time in 17 years that a UN high commissioner for human rights had travelled to China. In a statement about her visit she wrote ""The introduction of universal health care and almost universal unemployment insurance scheme go a long way in ensuring protection of the right to health and broader social and economic rights"".

Increased inequality
China's growth has been so rapid that virtually every household has benefited significantly, fueling the steep drop in poverty. However, different people have benefited to very different extents, so that inequality has risen during the reform period. This is true for inequality in household income or consumption, as well as for inequality in important social outcomes such as health status or educational attainment. Concerning household consumption, the Gini measure of inequality increased from 0.31 at the beginning of reform to 0.45 in 2004. To some extent this rise in inequality is the natural result of the market forces that have generated the strong growth; but to some extent it is ""artificial"" in the sense that various government policies exacerbate the tendencies toward higher inequality, rather than mitigate them. Changes to some policies could halt or even reverse the increasing inequality. (See List of countries by income equality.)

The Nobel Prize-winning economist Sir Arthur Lewis noted that ""development must be inegalitarian because it does not start in every part of the economy at the same time"" in 1954. China classically manifests two of the characteristics of development that Lewis had in mind: rising return to education and rural-urban migration. As an underdeveloped country, China began its reform with relatively few highly educated people, and with a small minority of the population (20%) living in cities, where labor productivity was about twice the level as in the countryside.

In pre-reform China there was very little return to education manifested in salaries. Cab drivers and college professors had similar incomes. Economic reform has created a labor market in which people can search for higher pay, and one result of this is that salaries for educated people have gone up dramatically. In the short period between 1988 and 2003, the wage returns to one additional year of schooling increased from 4% to 11%. This development initially leads to higher overall inequality, because the initial stock of educated people is small and they are concentrated at the high end of the income distribution. But if there is reasonably good access to education, then over time a greater and greater share of the population will become educated, and that will ultimately tend to reduce inequality.

The large productivity and wage gap between cities and countryside also drives a high rate of rural-urban migration, which has left millions of children traumatized due to parents who have left them to be raised by other family members, as the Chinese government does not allow parents who move to urban areas to take their children with them. Lewis pointed out that, starting from a situation of 80% rural, the initial shift of some from low-productivity agriculture to high productivity urban employment is disequalizing. If the flow continues until the population is more than 50% urban, however, further migration is equalizing. This pattern is very evident in the history of the U.S., with inequality rising during the rapid industrialization period from 1870 to 1920, and then declining thereafter. So, the same market forces that have produced the rapid growth in China predictably led to higher inequality. But it is important to note that in China there are a number of government policies that exacerbate this tendency toward higher inequality and restrict some of the potential mechanisms that would normally lead to an eventual decline in inequality.

Rural-urban divide

Much of the increase in inequality in China can be attributed to the widening rural-urban divide, particularly the differentials in rural-urban income. A household survey conducted in 1995 showed that the rural-urban income gap accounted for 35% of the overall inequality in China.

In 2009, according to the China's National Bureau of Statistics, the urban per capita annual income at US$2,525 was approximately three times that of the rural per capita annual income. This was the widest income gap recorded in China since 1978. Urban-based economic policies adopted by the government contribute to the income disparities. This is also known as the ‘artificial’ result of the rural-urban divide. In terms of the share of investments allotted by the state, urban areas were given a larger proportion when compared with rural areas. In the period 1986–1992, investments to urban state-owned enterprises (SOE) accounted for more than 25% of the total government budget. On the other hand, less than 10% of the government budget was allocated to investments in the rural economy in the same period by the state despite the fact that about 73-76% of the total population lived in the rural areas. However, the burden of the inflation caused by the fiscal expansion, which at that time was at a level of approximately 8.5%, was shared by all including the rural population. Such biased allocation of government finances to the urban sector meant that the wages earned by urban workers also include these government fiscal transfers. This is in addition to the relatively higher proportions of credit loans the government also provided to the urban SOEs in the same period. Meanwhile, the wages earned by the rural workers came mainly from growth in output only. These urban-biased policies reflect the importance of the urban minority to the government relative to the rural majority.

In the period when reforms in urban areas were introduced, the real wages earned by urban workers rose inexorably. Restrictions to rural-urban migration protected the urban workers from competition from the rural workers, which therefore also contributed to rural-urban disparities. According to a report by the World Bank published in 2009, 99% of the poor in China come from rural areas if migrant workers in cities are included in the rural population figures. Excluding migrant workers from the rural population figures indicates that 90% of poverty in China is still rural.

Inequality in China does not only occur between rural and urban areas. There exist inequalities within rural areas, and within urban areas themselves. In some rural areas, incomes are comparable to that of urban incomes, while in others, income remains low as development is limited. Rural-urban inequalities do not only refer to income differentials but also include inequalities in areas such as education and health care.

Urban poverty in China
The structural reforms of China's economy have brought about a widening of the income gap and rising unemployment in cities. The increasing challenge for the Chinese government and social organizations is to address and solve poverty issues in urban areas where people are increasingly being economically and socially marginalized. According to the official estimates, 12 million people were considered as urban poor in 1993, i.e. 3.6 per cent of the total urban population, but by 2006 the figure had jumped to more than 22 million, i.e. 4.1 per cent of the total urban population and these figures are estimated to grow if the government fails to institute any effective measures to circumvent this escalating problem.

China's “floating population” has since helped spur rapid development in the country because of the cheap and plentiful labor they can offer. On the flip side, many people who came from the rural areas are not able to find jobs in the cities. This surplus of rural laborers and mass internal migration will no doubt pose a major threat to the country's political stability and economic growth. Their inabilities to find jobs compounded by the rising costs of living in the cities have made many people fall below the poverty line.

There are also large numbers of unemployed and laid-off workers from state-owned enterprises (SOEs). These enterprises have since failed to compete efficiently with the private and foreign-funded companies when China's open-door policy was introduced. In the years 1995 to 2000, the state sector lost 31 million jobs, which amounted to 28 per cent of the jobs in the sector. The non-state sector has been creating new jobs but not in sufficient numbers to offset job losses from the state sector.

SOEs’ roles were more than employers, they are also responsible for the provision of welfare benefits, like retirement pensions, incentives for medical care, housing and direct subsidies and the like to its employees, as these burdens greatly increased production costs. In 1992, SOE expenses on insurance and welfare took up 35% of the total wages. Therefore, many people not only lost their jobs but also the social benefits and security that they were once so reliant on. The adverse consequences arising from the market reforms are evidently seen as a socially destabilizing factor.

Lastly, the government provided little or no social benefit for the urban poor who needed the most attention. Ministry of Labor and Social Security (MLSS) was the last line of defense against urban poverty in the provision of social insurance and the living allowance for laid-off employees. However, its effectiveness was limited in scope in which less than a quarter of the eligible urban poor actually receiving assistance.

The Minimum Living Standard Scheme was first implemented in Shanghai in 1993 to help supplement the income of the urban poor. It is a last resort program that is meant to help those that don't qualify for other forms of government aid. The Minimum Living Standard Scheme set regional poverty lines and gave recipients a sum of money. The amount of money received by each recipient was the difference in their income and the poverty line. The Scheme has grown rapidly and has since been adopted by over 580 cities and 1120 counties.

Rural Poverty 
While poverty has been reduced immensely in China over the past decade, it still remains a large problem in rural China. Rural China has historically been disproportionately taxed and also have received fewer benefits from the recent economic development and success of China. Agriculture has been the main occupation for the inhabitants of rural China, and in villages the produce generated is used to feed the village and not for selling on the market. Even in the heartlands of China where agriculture is used for commercial purposes, the economic boom of China has actually led to a decrease in the price of produce which has resulted in a loss of income for these producers.

Children growing up in poverty are more likely to be undernourished, have less educational opportunities, and have lower literacy levels. And those whose parents move to urban areas in an effort to give these children a better life—and are not allowed by the Chinese government to take their children with them—are unintentionally traumatizing and damaging these children. Studies show approximately 70% of the 'left-behind' kids—they are sometimes called the 'lost generation', or the 'damaged generation', suffer from emotional trauma, depression or anxiety. About a third of the left-behind children—20 million—will get involved in crime, while another third will need time in mental health institutions.

The disproportionate amount of inequality in China's rural sector along with correlation between poverty and education shows that children born in rural China are much more likely to score lower on literacy tests and not have the opportunity to pursue higher education.

The implementation of Chinese policy has exacerbated the issue of rural poverty en lieu of increased urban poverty. Typically the urbanization of a country leads to mass migration from the rural areas to the urban. However, the Chinese government implemented a policy that restricts the migration of people born in rural China from coming to urban China. This restriction is based on the citizen's registration under the hukou system, which states if the individual was born in an agricultural (rural) or non-agricultural (urban) area. Additionally, Chinese officials have been cracking down on Chinese migrants from rural communities that have moved to Beijing. In 2017, thousands of migrant workers living in Beijing were evicted because they did not possess an urban hukou. This process of removing migrants from rural to urban China, relocates them back to rural China where they no longer have a job or source of income. This is a relocation of poverty from the urban sector to the rural sector.

The political response of China's government to the issue of rural poverty has been both lauded and criticized. China has been criticized for its high rate of rural poverty and the policies that the government has put in place to ameliorate the poverty. In Transformation of Rural China, Jonathan Unger points out that the lack of taxation at the village level restricts the villages from dealing with the problems they face. This means problems such as food instability and lack of education are not able to be addressed by local officials. Supporters of government policy point out that over the time period of 1978 to 2014, China has reduced rural poverty from 250 million people to just over 70 million people. China's Rural Poverty Alleviation and Development Outline from 2001 to 2010 led to certain government policy directly dealing with the issue of poverty with the removal of agriculture tax in 2006 and a program which the government paid rural families to plant trees on degraded land. More fundamental and radical measures such as directly redistributive taxation and social security systems or land tenure and agricultural produce price reforms are not mentioned here, however: presumably because they are not considered prudent.

Unequal educational opportunity

Education is a prerequisite for the development of human capital which in turn is an important factor in a country's overall development. Apart from the increasing income inequality, the education sector has long suffered from problems such as funding shortages and unequal allocation of education resources, adding to the disparity between China's urban and rural life; this was exacerbated by the two track system of government's approach to education. The first track is government -supported primary education in urban areas and the second is family -supported primary education in the rural areas.

Rural education has been marginalized by the focus on immediate economic development and the fact that urban education enjoys more attention and investment by the central government. This lack of public funding meant that children of rural families were forced to drop out of school, thus losing the opportunity to further their studies and following the paths of their parents to become low skilled workers with few chances of advancements. This leads to a vicious cycle of poverty. Because of limited educational resources, urban schools were supported by the government while village schools were provided for by the local communities where educational opportunities were possibly constrained depending on local conditions. Thus, there still exist a huge gap in teacher preparation and quality of facilities between rural and urban areas.

The two track system was then abolished in 1986 & 1992, to be replaced by the Compulsory Education Law and the Rule for the Implementation of the Compulsory Education Law respectively. Despite the emphasis of China's education reform on providing quality and holistic education, the rural schools still lack the capacity to implement such reforms vis-à-vis their urban counterparts. The rural areas lack the educational resources of the urban areas and the rural areas are considered to be falling below the educational benchmark set in the cities. Teachers are more attracted to urban sectors with higher pay and a slew of benefits. In addition, rural villages have a difficult time finding quality teachers because of the lower standard of living in villages. As a result, some rural teachers are not qualified as they received college degrees from continuing-education programs, which is not the best type of further education one could receive.

As a result, rural students often find themselves neither competitive enough to gain admissions to colleges nor employable for most occupations. Rural residents are increasingly being marginalised in higher education, closing off their best opportunities for advancement. This is especially prominent in Tsinghua and Peking University where the percentage of rural population studying in the two universities have shrunk to 17.6 percent in 2000 and 16.3 percent in 1999, down from 50 to 60 percent in the 1950s. These numbers are the most recent reliable data that has been published and experts agree that the number might be as low as 1 percent in 2010.

Restrictions on migration

Pre-reform China had a system that severely restricted people's mobility, and that system has only slowly been reformed over the past 25 years. Each person has a registration (hukou) in either a rural area or an urban area, and cannot change the hukou without the permission of the receiving jurisdiction. In practice cities usually give registration to skilled people who have offers of employment, but have generally been reluctant to provide registration to migrants from the countryside. Nevertheless, these migrants are needed for economic development, and large numbers have in fact migrated. Many of these fall into the category of ""floating population"". There are nearly 200 million rural residents who spend at least six months of the year working in urban areas. Many of these people have for all practical purposes moved to a city, but they do not have official registration. Beyond the floating population, there are tens of millions of people who have left rural areas and obtained urban hukous.

So, there is significant rural-urban migration in China, but it seems likely that the hukou system has resulted in less migration than otherwise would have occurred. There are several pieces of evidence to support this view. First, the gap in per capita income between rural and urban areas widened during the reform period, reaching a ratio of three to one. Three to one is a very high gap by international standards. Second, manufacturing wages have risen sharply in recent years, at double-digit rates, so that China now has considerably higher wages than much of the rest of developing Asia (India, Vietnam, Pakistan, Bangladesh). This rise is good for the incumbent workers, but they are relatively high up in China's income distribution, so that the wage increases raise inequality. It is hard to imagine that manufacturing wages would have risen so rapidly if there had not been such controls on labor migration. Third, recent studies focusing on migrants have shown that it is difficult for them to bring their families to the city, put their children in school, and obtain healthcare. So, the growth of the urban population must have been slowed down by these restrictions.

China's urbanization so far has been a relatively orderly process. One does not see in China the kinds of slums and extreme poverty that exist in cities throughout South Asia, Latin America, and Africa. Nevertheless, urbanization goes on: the urban share of China's population has risen from 20% to 40% during the course of economic reform. But at the same time the hukou system has slowed and distorted urbanization, without preventing it. The system has likely contributed to inequality by limiting the opportunities of the relatively poor rural population to move to better-paying employment.

Land policy

Just as Chinese citizens are either registered as urban or rural under the Hukou system, land in China is zoned as either rural or urban. Under Chinese property law, there is no privately held land. Urban land is owned by the state, which grants land rights for a set number of years. Reforms in the late 1980s and 1990s allowed for transactions in urban land, enabling citizens to sell their land and buildings, or mortgage them to borrow, while still retaining state ownership. Rural, or “collectively owned land”, is leased by the state for periods of 30 years, and is theoretically reserved for agricultural purposes, housing and services for farmers. Peasants have long-term tenure as long as they sow the land, but they cannot mortgage or sell the use rights. The biggest distortion, however, concerns moving land from rural to urban use. China is a densely populated, water-scarce country whose comparative advantage lies more in manufacturing and services than in agriculture. The fact that many peasants cannot earn a decent living as farmers is a signal that their labor is more useful in urban employment, hence the hundreds of millions of people who have migrated. But, at the same time, it is efficient to allocate some of the land out of agriculture for urban use.

In China, that conversion is handled administratively, requiring central approval. Farmers are compensated based on the agricultural value of the land. But the reason to convert land – especially in the fringes around cities – is that the commercial value of the land for urban use is higher than its value for agriculture. So, even if China's laws on land are followed scrupulously, the conversion does not generate a high income for the peasants. There are cases in which the conversion is done transparently, the use of rights over the land auctioned, and the revenue collected put into the public budget to finance public goods. But still the peasants get relatively poor recompense. One government study found that 62% of displaced peasants were worse off after land conversion.

Secure land tenure is recognized as a powerful tool to reduce poverty, and the central government has begun guaranteeing all farmers 30-year land rights, strictly limiting expropriations, documenting and publicizing farmers’ rights, and requiring sufficient compensation when farmers’ lands are expropriated. A 2010 survey of 17 provinces by Landesa found improved documentation of farmer's land rights, but much room for improvement: 63% of farming families have been issued land-rights certificates and 53% have land-rights contracts, but only 44% have been issued both documents (as is required by law) and 29% have no document at all; farmers who have been issued these documents are far more likely to make long-term investments in their land and are financially benefiting from those investments.

Fiscal system and rural social services

Market reform has dramatically increased the return to education, as it indicates that there are good opportunities for skilled people and as it creates a powerful incentive for families to increase the education of their children. However, there needs to be strong public support for education and reasonably fair access to the education system. Otherwise, inequality can become self-perpetuating: if only high-income people can educate their children, then that group remains a privileged, high-income group permanently. China is at some risk of falling into this trap, because it has developed a highly decentralized fiscal system in which local governments rely primarily on local tax collection to provide basic services such as primary education and primary health care. China in fact has one of the most decentralized fiscal systems in the world.

China is much more decentralized than OECD countries and middle-income countries, particularly on the spending side. More than half of all expenditure takes place at the sub-provincial level. In part, the sheer size of the country explains this degree of decentralization, but the structure of government and some unusual expenditure assignments also give rise to this pattern of spending. Functions such as social security, justice, and even the production of national statistics are largely decentralized in China, whereas they are central functions in most other countries.

Fiscal disparities among subnational governments are larger in China than in most OECD countries. These disparities have emerged alongside a growing disparity in economic strength among the provinces. From 1990 to 2003, the ratio of per capita GDP of the richest to poorest province grew from 7.3 to 13. In China, the richest province has more than 8 times the per capita public spending than the poorest province. In the US, the poorest state has about 65 percent of the revenues of the average state, and in Germany, any state falling below 95 percent of the average level gets subsidized through the ""Finanzausgleich"" (and any receiving more than 110 percent gets taxed). In Brazil, the richest state has 2.3 times the revenues per capita of the poorest state.

Inequalities in spending are even larger at the sub-provincial level. The richest county, the level that is most important for service delivery, has about 48 times the level of per capita spending of the poorest county. These disparities in aggregate spending levels also show up in functional categories such as health and education where variation among counties and among provinces is large.

These differences in public spending translate into differences in social outcomes. Up through 1990, there were only modest differences across provinces in infant survival rate, but by 2000 there had emerged a very sharp difference, closely related to the province's per capita GDP. So too with the high-school enrollment rate: there used to be small differences across provinces. By 2003, high-school enrollment was nearing 100% in the wealthier provinces while still less than 40% in poor provinces.

There is some redistribution within China's fiscal system, but arguments abound whether it is enough. Poor areas have very little tax collection and hence cannot fund education and health care. Some of their population will relocate over time. But for reasons of both national efficiency and opportunity, some theoretical economists argue for the communist state to ensure everyone has some basic education and basic health care.

China's highly decentralized fiscal system results in: local government in many locations not having adequate resources to fund basic social services. As a consequence, households are left to pay for their own needs to a remarkable extent. The average hospital visit in China in 2018 is paid 35% out-of-pocket by the patient, compared to 25% in Mexico, 17% in Australia, 10% in Turkey and the United States, and lower amounts in most developed countries. Poor households either forego treatment, or travel to other cities for treatment, which can be expensive if the condition is severe. In the 2003 National Health Survey, 30% of poor households identified a large health care expenditure as the reason that they were having financial difficulties.

The situation in education is similar. In a survey of 3037 villages in 2004, average primary school fees were 260 yuan and average middle-school fees, 442 yuan. A family living right at the dollar-a-day poverty line would have about 900 yuan total resources for a child for a year; sending a child to middle-school would take half of that. Not surprisingly, then, enrollment rates are relatively low in poor areas and for poor families.

Women In Poverty

Women In Poverty

In China, women are more vulnerable to suffer from severe poverty than men. More women experience multidimensional poverty (38.9% compared to 25.2%). Many individual and social characteristics shape women's experiences on poverty, such as age, education, employment, family structure, family size, urban or rural areas, etc.

Article body 
In terms of individual factors, women are less likely complete their primary education, have worse health and nutrition, and more likely to enduring chronic diseases, hospitalization and low income. As daughter, women's education is less valued by their parents. As mothers, women are expected to value their children's care work more than their own career. In addition, the gender inequalities in the labor market is pervasive. The labor force participation rate of women has declined since the economic reforms and financial hardship was severe among women. In terms of marital factors, research shows that single mothers are the suffer the most from poverty. On the one hand, social and public policies are usually inadequate for single-parent families, especially families headed by women. On the other hand, Chinese traditional belief on family see divorce as negative, and often push mothers to sacrifice themselves to fulfill their children. Age is also a factor that contribute to women's poverty. Research shows that women are in lower chance to receive less occupational pension and receive less benefit (women receive 595 yuan per month whereas men receive 1,105 yuan). Also, women in their 50s are more likely to take the responsibility of caring their elderly parents and grandchildren, therefore more likely to retire earlier and receive less money in pension.

In terms of regional factors, women who live in remote and less developed western region are more likely to live in poverty than eastern area. For example, women live in Guizhou and Gansu provinces have the highest multidimensional poverty rate. Many women in poverty immigrant from their hometown to another province for improving their living situation, and many use marriage as the approach. (Research shows much more women migrated from relatively less developed regions to more developed regions through marriage than men). Some women did get out of absolute poverty through marriage, however, because of limited opportunities, they are likely to fall into relative poverty soon after relocation. Also, migrant wives often suffer from perpetuated poverty after marriage.

In the state level, it is hard to find official data on women in poverty and poverty reduction programs tend to focus more on men, which widen the gender inequality. A research focus on a poverty reduction program in the Inner Mongolia shows that women's empowerment program can make positive effects on poverty reduction. It suggest that if poverty program can be more gender-focus, women and their household in poverty can benefit more from intervention such as training, cooperatives, and credit.

John O'Reilly coached the team in his seventh season as head coach. Georgetown was an independent and played its home games at Ryan Gymnasium on the Georgetown campus in Washington, D.C. and finished the season with a record of 10-4.

Season recap

On-campus Ryan Gymnasium, where the Hoyas had played their home games since the 1914-15 season, had no seating, accommodating fans on a standing-room only-basis on an indoor track above the court. This precluded the accommodation of significant crowds, providing the self-sustaining Basketball Association with little revenue with which to fund the teams travel expenses, and Georgetown averaged no more than three road games a year from the 1918-19 season thrtough the 1926-27 season in order to keep travel to a minimum. The 1920-21 teams only road trip outside of Washington was to play schools in Pennsylvania at the end of the season.

The Hoyas home winning streak at Ryan Gymnasium reached 34 games at the end of this season, dating back to a victory against Bucknell on the last day of the 1916-17 season; it would reach 52 before finally coming to an end during the 1923-24 season. Highlights of the home season at Ryan included Georgetowns upsets of Georgia Tech and North Carolina, two of the most highly regarded teams in the United States at the time. Georgetown also defeated crosstown rival George Washington twice this season, giving the Hoyas a 14-game winning streak against George Washington – 10 of the wins at Ryan Gymnasium – dating back to 1915.

Junior forward Jack Flavin was the teams highest scorer, scoring about a third of the teams points. An excellent shooter, he averaged 12.5 points per gane, and scored a total of 175 points.

Junior guard Andrew ""Andy"" Zazzali played in all 14 games, averaging 4.8 points per game and scoring a total of 65 points. He played an excellent defense during the season; over a stretch of five games that included games against nationally renowned St. John's, North Carolina, and Georgia Tech, his defense played a major role in holding opponents to an average of less than six points in the first half.

Sophomore forward Paul Florence was the only new player on the team, which had finished with a 13-1 record the previous season. He was a very accurate shooter, and despite being surrounded by veterans led the team in its season-opening 10-game winning streak. He finished second in scoring, appearing in 12 games, scoring 72 points, and averaging 6.0 points per game for the season.

The team won its first 10 games, nine of them at home and one across town against George Washington. It then finished the season by losing all four games on its only road trip to end with a 10-4 record.

O'Reilly fell ill after this season and was unable to coach the Hoyas for the next two seasons. He returned to the head coaching position in time for the 1923-24 season.

Roster

Sources

Georgetown players did not wear numbers on their jerseys this season. The first numbered jerseys in Georgetown mens basketball history would not appear until the 1933-34 season.

Senior forward Bill Dudack later served as the Hoyas head coach during the 1929-30 season.

1920–21 schedule and results
Sources

It was common practice at this time for colleges and universities to include non-collegiate opponents in their schedules, with the games recognized as part of their official record for the season, so the January 24, 1921, game against a United States Army team from Camp A. A. Humphreys in Virginia counted as part of Georgetowns won-loss record for 1920-21. It was not until 1952, after the completion of the 1951-52 season, that the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) ruled that colleges and universities could no longer count games played against non-collegiate opponents in their annual won-loss records.

Edmondson (born June 10, 1959) is an American businessman, known for his career at RadioShack and his termination as CEO for falsifying his educational background.

Early life and education 
David J. Edmondson was born June 10, 1959, in Methuen, Massachusetts. His mother Jeannette was a homemaker, and his adoptive father was a US soldier. Like most children of military families, Edmondson moved a great deal throughout his early life, including periods in Germany and Fort Jackson, South Carolina, before settling at Fort Carson, Colorado, in 1968, where Edmondson remained until his graduation from Alpha Omega Christian School in 1977.

Edmondson moved to San Dimas, California, in 1977 where he attended Pacific Coast Baptist Bible College (PCBBC). While at Pacific Coast Baptist Bible College, Edmondson began his study to become a Baptist minister. Edmondson left California after one year on campus and returned to Colorado where he became the associate pastor of Security Baptist Temple, in Security, Colorado.  He continued his studies through correspondence with PCBBC and claimed he earned his ThG (Graduate of Theology) in May 1980.

Although he has attended several colleges, he does not currently hold any academic degrees.

Career 
After his ordination, Edmondson relocated to Omaha, Nebraska, where he founded the Twin Cities Baptist Church.  He started the church in a borrowed space donated by an Omaha businessman.

In 1982, Edmondson returned to Colorado Springs and attempted to start another church.  The second church was not successful and Edmondson left the full-time ministry.

In 1983, Edmondson again relocated, this time to Cleveland, Ohio, and went to work for direct mail advertising company ADVO System, Inc. While serving as national account marketing executive, Edmondson worked on developing and implementing marketing programs with various divisions of Tandy Corporation, including its RadioShack Division.

RadioShack 
Edmondson held positions as vice president of marketing (1994–1995), senior vice president of marketing and advertising (1995–1997), executive vice president and chief operating officer (1997–2000), president and chief operating officer (2000–2005) and chief executive officer (2005-2006).

Arrests, newspaper investigation, resignation 
In January 2005, shortly after RadioShack announced that Edmondson would be taking over as CEO, he was arrested in Southlake, Texas, for driving while intoxicated, his third such charge. Edmondson pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 30 days in jail. The incident prompted the Fort Worth Star-Telegram to begin looking more closely at his past.

Edmondson resigned in February 2006, after the Star-Telegram disclosed that he had falsified his résumé and biography, claiming two non-existent college degrees.

Post-RadioShack 
In 2007, Edmondson founded EasySale, an Internet-based consignment and liquidation company based in Arlington, Texas. In 2009, he co-founded and became CEO of E-Recycling Corps (now HYLA Mobile), an enterprise engaged in the collection, refurbishment and global redistribution of used wireless devices. According to Pitchbook-October 1, 2018, HYLA Mobile is the most valuable venture capital backed company in the State of Texas, valued at $650 million. According to the SEC (Security and Exchange Commission) filing on March 3, 2021, Edmondson became a member of the board of directors for the blank check SPAC (Special Purpose Acquisition Company) Aeon Acquisition Corp. managing $125 million dollars.

He was the founder of the Brazilian Labour Renewal Party (PRTB) and ran for president of Brazil in the elections of 2010 and 2014. He was particularly known in Brazil for his promise of building a bullet train system connecting São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro (the aerotrem) and for his controversial declarations about homosexuals during a political debate in 2014. Also known for being a perennial candidate, he ran for several political posts but never won one. Fidelix died on 23 April 2021 due to COVID-19 complications.

Biography
Fidelix was born in the town of Mutum, Minas Gerais in 1951 to Jarbas Fidelix, a merchant who worked in the field of transportation, and Lecy Araújo, an educator. He moved to Rio de Janeiro, then the capital of Brazil, and studied communication science at the Fluminense Federal University, but he did not graduate. He later became a journalist and professional advertiser. Fidelix was a Roman Catholic.

At the age of 24, he founded the advertising agency Staff Publicidade and also worked as a design director at Art&Som and Vogue Publicidade. As a journalist, he worked for Correio da Manhã and Última Hora, where he revised the Diário Oficial da União.

Fidelix worked for the government as a communications assistant and created Agricultura Urgente, the first national bulletin of agriculture. Through Agricultura Urgente, he launched Brazil's first ecological campaign, which earned him a presidential medal. He co-founded the business magazine Governo e Empresa and the political magazine O Poder. Around 1976, he was the chief communications officer of Estanave, a company related to Petrobras.

In 1982, he founded Interface, the first Brazilian magazine about informatics. In 1983, he moved to São Paulo, where he worked for two years as an anchorman for TV Informátika, a TV program about informatics, in which he interviewed specialists and politicians.

Political career
In 1984, Fidelix co-founded the Liberal Party with Álvaro Valle. In 1986, he contested his first political election, running for State Deputy of São Paulo, and received 735 votes.

He later switched to the Renovator Labour Party and contested his second election running for Federal Deputy. He received 541 votes.

In 1989 and 1990, he worked as a communications assistant for Fernando Collor's presidential campaign. In 1994, he founded the Brazilian Labour Renewal Party (PRTB), the party he remained with until his death in 2021, and tried to run for president for the first time but was unable to register. He subsequently ran for Mayor of São Paulo in 1996 (receiving 3,608 votes or 0.068% of the total), Governor of São Paulo in 1998 (receiving 14,406 votes) and 2002 (8,654 votes), Alderman of São Paulo  in 2004 (3,382 votes), Federal Deputy in 2006 (5,518 votes), and Mayor of São Paulo in 2008 (receiving 0.09% of the vote).

In 2010, he ran for president of Brazil for the first time and placed seventh (57,960 or 0.06% of the total). He ran for Mayor of São Paulo in 2012 and again for President of Brazil in 2014, supporting the Brazilian military dictatorship. He received 446,878 votes (0.43% of the vote), again finishing seventh; this was the closest Fidelix came during his political career to winning an election.

Statements about homosexuals
On 29 September 2014, during a debate among candidates of the 2014 presidential election hosted by RecordTV, Fidelix stated that homosexuals ""need psychological care"" and were better kept ""well away from [the rest of] us"". He also said that Brazil's population of 200 million would be reduced by half if homosexuality were encouraged because ""the excretory system"" does not function as a means of reproduction. He was asked to apologize but refused, believing that his statements were not offensive.

Fidelix's statements were condemned by opponents like Luciana Genro (PSOL), Marina Silva (PSB), Aécio Neves (PSDB), Dilma Rousseff (PT), who later won the election, as well as organizations such as ABGLT, the Green Party, and even the Ministry of Human Rights. On the other hand, other notable conservative politicians, such as Jair Bolsonaro (PP) and religious personalities, like Silas Malafaia, declared their support for Fidelix.

On 13 March 2015, São Paulo's Court of Justice fined Fidelix with R$1 million for hate speech in his declarations. The court lifted the fine on 3 February 2017 but imposed a revised fine of R$25,000 on 22 February.

Every time I visit , he 's always making something .""]","In linguistics, the aspect of a verb is a grammatical category that defines the temporal flow (or lack thereof) in a given action, event, or state. As its name suggests, the habitual aspect (abbreviated ), not to be confused with iterative aspect or frequentative aspect, specifies an action as occurring habitually: the subject performs the action usually, ordinarily, or customarily. As such, the habitual aspect provides structural information on the nature of the subject referent, ""John smokes"" being interpretable as ""John is a smoker"", ""Enjoh habitually gets up early in the morning"" as ""Enjoh is an early bird"". The habitual aspect is a type of imperfective aspect, which does not depict an event as a single entity viewed only as a whole but instead specifies something about its internal temporal structure.

Östen Dahl found that the habitual past, the most common tense context for the habitual, occurred in only seven of 60 languages sampled, including English. Especially in Turkic languages such as Azerbaijani and Turkish, he found that the habitual can occur in combination with the predictive mood.

Hindustani 

Modern Hindustani (Hindi and Urdu) has a specific participle form to mark the habitual aspect. Habitual aspect in Hindi grammar is marked by the habitual participle. The habitual participle is constructed from the infinitive form of the verb by removing the infinitive marker -nā from the verb root and adding -tā. The participles agree with the gender and the number of the subject of the sentence which is marked by the vowel the participles end in. Periphrastic Hindustani verb forms consist of two elements. The first element is the aspect marker. The second element is the tense-mood marker.

There are four different copulas with which the habitual participle can be used: honā (to be, to happen), rêhnā (to stay, to remain), jānā (to go), and ānā (to come). These verbs, even when they are used as copula, themselves can be turned into aspectual participles and can be used with the default auxiliary verb honā (to be), hence forming sub-aspects that combine the nuance of two aspects. The auxiliary rêhnā (to stay) gives a nuance of continuity of the perfective state, jānā (to go) is used to construct the passive voice when used with the perfective participle, shows that the action is completed when it is used with intransitive verbs and shows continuity when it is used with habitual participle.

Hindustani has three grammatical aspectsː habitual, perfective and progressive. Conjugating the auxiliary verbs, which are above in the infinitive form, into their aspectual forms using the auxiliary honā (to be) gives subaspectual forms for the habitual aspect in their infintive formː

English

Standard English has two habitual aspectual forms in the past tense. One is illustrated by the sentence I used to go there frequently. The used to [infinitive] construction always refers to the habitual aspect when the infinitive is a non-stative verb; in contrast, when used to is used with a stative verb, the aspect can be interpreted as continuous (that is, it indicates an ongoing, unchanging state, as in I used to know that), although Bernard Comrie classifies this, too, as habitual. Used to can be used with or without an indicator of temporal location in the past (We used to do that, We used to do that in 1974); but the time indicator cannot be too specific; for example, *We used to do that at 3 pm yesterday is not grammatical.

The second way that habituality is expressed in the past is by using the auxiliary verb would, as in Last summer we would go there every day. This usage requires a lexical indication of when the action occurred; by itself the sentence We would go there does not express habituality, while We used to go there does even though it does not specify when. As with used to, would also has other uses in English that do not indicate habituality: in In January 1986 I knew I would graduate in four months, it indicates the future viewed from a past perspective; in I would go if I felt better, it indicates the conditional mood.

English can also indicate habituality in a time-unspecific way, referring generically to the past, present, and future, by using the auxiliary will as in He will make that mistake all the time, won't he?.  As with used to and would, the auxiliary will has other uses as well: as an indicator of future time (The sun will rise tomorrow at 6:14), and as a modal verb indicating volition (At this moment I will not tolerate dissent).

Habitual aspect is frequently expressed in unmarked form in English, as in I walked to work every day for ten years, I walk to work every day, and I will walk to work every day after I get well.

The habitual and progressive aspects can be combined in English, as in He used to be playing.. Every time I visit, he's always making something.

Present tense

African American Vernacular English and Caribbean English use an invariant be to mark habitual or extended actions in the present tense. Some Hiberno-English in Ireland uses the construction do be to mark the habitual present.

Romance languages
Romance languages like French, Spanish, Italian, and Portuguese do not have a grammatical form that is specific to the habitual aspect. In the past tense, they have a form called the imperfect, which combines the past tense with the imperfective aspect and indicates that a past ongoing process was habitual or continuous.

Cantonese
Cantonese, a Sinitic language, has a dedicated particle to express the habitual aspect, 開 hoi1, which follows the verb. This is unlike Mandarin and some other Sinitic languages, which have no grammatical indicators of the habitual aspect, but may express habituality via circumlocution.

The dynasty's reign (664–525 BC) is also called the Saite Period after the city of Sais, where its pharaohs had their capital, and marks the beginning of the Late Period of ancient Egypt.

History
This dynasty traced its origins to the Twenty-fourth Dynasty. Psamtik I was probably a descendant of Bakenranef.

Following the Assyrian conquest of Egypt by the Neo-Assyrian Empire during the reigns of Taharqa and Tantamani, and the subsequent collapse of the Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt, Psamtik I was recognized as sole king over all of Egypt. Psamtik formed alliances with King Gyges of Lydia, who sent him mercenaries from Caria and ancient Greece which Psamtik used to unify all of Egypt under his rule.

With the sack of Nineveh in 612 BC and the fall of the Neo-Assyrian Empire, both Psamtik and his successors attempted to reassert Egyptian power in the Near East, but were driven back by the Neo-Babylonian Empire under Nebuchadnezzar II. With the help of Greek mercenaries, Pharaoh Apries was able to hold back Babylonian attempts to conquer Egypt. 

The Persians would eventually invade Egypt in 525 BCE, when their king, Cambyses II, captured and later executed Psamtik III, in the Achaemenid conquest of Egypt, eventually founding the Achaemenid Twenty-seventh Dynasty of Egypt.

Archaeology 
In May 2020, an Egyptian-Spanish archaeological mission headed by Esther Ponce revealed a unique cemetery, which consists of one room built with glazed limestone dating back to the 26th Dynasty (also known as the El-Sawi era) at the site of ancient Oxyrhynchus. Archaeologists also uncovered bronze coins, clay seals, Roman tombstones and small crosses. On October 3, 2020, Egypt unveiled 59 coffins of priests and clerks from the 26th dynasty, dating to nearly 2,500 years ago.

Pharaohs of the 26th Dynasty

The 26th Dynasty may be related to the 24th Dynasty. Manetho begins the dynasty with:
 Ammeris the Nubian, 12 (or 18) years
 Stephinates, 7 years
 Nechepsos, 6 years
 Necho, 8 years.

When the Nubian King Shabaka defeated Bakenranef, son of Tefnakht, he likely installed a Nubian commander as governor at Sais. This may be the man named Ammeris. Stephinates may be a descendant of Bakenrenef. He is sometimes referred to as Tefnakht II in the literature. Nechepsos has been identified with a local king named Nekauba (678–672 BC). Manetho's Necho is King Necho I (672–664 BC); Manetho gives his reign as 8 years. Necho was killed during a conflict with the Nubian king Tantamani. Psamtik I fled to Nineveh – capital of the Neo-Assyrian Empire – and returned to Egypt when Ashurbanipal defeated Tantamani and drove him back south. Scholars now start the 26th Dynasty with the reign of Psamtik I.

Sextus Julius Africanus states in his often accurate version of Manetho's Epitome that the dynasty numbered 9 pharaohs, beginning with a ""Stephinates"" (Tefnakht II) and ending with Psamtik III. Africanus also notes that Psamtik I and Necho I ruled for 54 and 8 years respectively.

These projects are meant to keep up with the population's rapid growth, which has strained the country's current infrastructure.

Roads

Doha has a comprehensive road network made up primarily of two and three-lane dual carriageways (divided highways). As a result of Doha being a relatively young city circling a central area, a majority of main streets are inordinately wide highway-like motorways that usually include service roads and large medians. While traditionally roundabouts have been used as intersections in the city, they are being rapidly phased out for signalized intersections as they are proving ineffective at regulating the increased traffic flow in turn overloading the city's road network. Most major roundabouts have been either converted to intersections or interchanges.

Highways
There are five main highways connecting Doha to its neighboring cities. These are the Dukhan Highway to the west of the city, the Al-Shamal Road, connecting Doha to the north of the country, the Al Khor Coastal Road, connecting Doha to the northern town of Al Khor, and the Al Wakrah/Mesaieed Road, connecting Doha to the south of the country. Finally, Salwa Road runs through south Doha and connects the city to the Saudi border to the south of the country.

These highways are all currently undergoing expansion, and are being expanded within Doha itself.

Doha Expressway (D-Ring Road/Al Shamal Road)
The Al Shamal-Road has traditionally connected to the D‑Ring Road in Doha, a three-lane dual carriageway that connects the city on a north-south axis. However, as a result of congestion, the D‑Ring Road is being converted into a major highway through the city, and its name has been changed to the Doha Expressway, connecting Doha as a whole and connecting Doha with the north of Qatar. Several phases of the expressway have been completed, including the Al Shamal Bridge, the Landmark Interchange, the Gharaffa Interchange, and the Midmac/Salwa Road Interchange.

The Al Shamal Road is also undergoing significant expansion as part of the Doha Expressway project. The road is being expanded into a four-lane highway (a total of eight lanes) with major interchanges which will better serve the country than the existing two-lane dual carriageway. Furthermore, the new Doha Expressway will connect Doha with the planned Qatar-Bahrain Friendship Bridge at al-Zubara, connecting the two Persian Gulf states in a similar manner Bahrain and Saudi Arabia are currently connected.

Al Khor Coastal Road
Commutes between Doha and the municipality of Al Khor are currently facilitated Al Khor Coastal Road, which runs through Al Daayen.

Lusail Expressway
The Lusail expressway is expected to connect the new city of Lusail, currently being constructed north of Doha, to central Doha, along with connecting the Pearl island to the mainland. The expressway is expected to take the path along the former Istiqlal Road, now Lusail Street, and will be a 4‑lane dual carriageway passing through the city. The expressway will extend from Lusail City, through Rainbow roundabout, the Qatar Sports Club roundabout, and the fire department roundabout.

Dukhan Highway
Doha is linked to the country's western settlements, namely Dukhan, through Dukhan Highway. The Public Works Authority carried out the Dukhan Highway Central Project in 2017 to enhance the road network.

Salwa Highway
The Salwa Highway project's first phase has been completed. This phase involved the expansion of the highway, which connects Doha to the southwestern town of Salwa on the Saudi Arabian border, into a four-lane highway with grade separated interchanges. The rest of Salwa Road is expected to be expanded and upgraded, from the recently completed Industrial Area Interchange to the Jaidah flyover, including the construction of an underpass at the Ramada signals, Doha's busiest traffic light intersection. This project is not expected to commence until after the completion of the Doha Expressway.

F-Ring Road
The F‑Ring Road will be the sixth ring road in Doha, and is being constructed as part of the transportation network leading to the New Doha International Airport. The new highway will connect the airport to the corniche at the new Ras Abu Aboud interchange, currently under construction, and will involve a new ring road south of the E‑Ring Road.

Taxis
The state-owned Mowasalat company was founded in 2004 to run the country's public transportation. It operates all taxis in Qatar under the ""Karwa"" brand, with thousands of taxis in the capital. Taxi stands are usually found near malls and shopping centers. In the past difficulties arose in finding Karwa taxis due to the small number of taxis available at launch, which gradually replaced all privately owned taxis.

Fares start at 10 riyals(25Qar from the airport) and the majority of taxis are sedans such as the Toyota Camry and  Škoda Octavias. Most airport taxis at the Doha International Airport are Ford Freestars.

Bus networks

Public bus network
An extensive bus system solely operated by the state-owned Mowasalat commenced in October 2004. It runs in the city of Doha and most of the major towns with one route that terminates as far as the Saudi border. The system covers many areas of the capital city with varied bus stop configurations ranging from open stops to semi-covered and enclosed. The system is mainly used by lower-income segments as the network connectivity is not always feasible and most buses route to the main bus stop - which in itself is a semi-covered non-air conditioned space. This clubbed with the fact that most people prefer to use their private vehicles has not led to a major shift of the city's population to public networks. However, the Doha metro is expected to change that.

The main bus terminal is located in the Souqs area of downtown Doha with services operating to all major towns in Qatar. Mowasalat operates a total of 50 routes starting as early as 4am with last buses timed to depart around 11pm. It also offers three routes that cover major stops terminating at the new Hamad International airport in Doha. The fleet also has buses that run on natural gas, having launched the region's first CNG-fuelled buses. Mowasalat also provides transportation for public schools with a fleet of over 1800 buses. The company states that it plans to expand nationwide through six major bus stations, 16 depots and 1000 buses by 2020.

Shuttle network (West bay) 
Qatar's Ministry of Transport launched this shuttle service for the West Bay district to help ease congestion in this business district. It has been operated by state-owned transport company, Mowasalat. It provides a transport choice for tourists and residents alike and was expanded in 2016 to cover more areas in the district. The single route network operates from 6 am to 9 pm with a frequency of 15 minutes. Initially launched as a free service with two lines, both the blue line and the red line have been combined into a single route pay and use facility. The route was introduced with the objective to ease the parking challenges in the congested district which houses Ministries, government organizations, corporate towers, hotels, embassies & sports clubs.

Some landmarks covered along the route include, Khalifa International Tennis and Squash Complex, The Doha Exhibition and Convention Center (DECC), Dafna Towers, Ministry of Justice tower, Public Works Authority (Ashghal) buildings, Sheraton grand Doha resort and convention center, City Center shopping mall, General Post office building and several government ministries towers.

Tourist network (Doha Bus) 
Doha Bus is a private operated hop on hop off service established in the spring of 2013. The network has a fleet of double-decker buses and has been designed to provide a flexible approach to discovery the capital. The major interest points covered on these routes include;

- Souq Waqif (traditional market) 

- Museum of Islamic art

- Katara (cultural landmark)

- Pearl Island

- Education city (Qatar Foundation)

- City center (major shopping mall)

- Grand Mosque

- Doha Corniche (water front promenade)

- Qatar National Convention Center

Railways
The Qatar Integrated Railway Project covers four metro lines in Doha, tram routes in West Bay and Lusail, a high-speed line, and dedicated freight railways.

Doha Metro

Red Line has opened on 8 May 2019 for commuters to travel in, from al Qassar station to al Wakra (13 stations). Other lines and stations are yet to be completed.

A four-line, 300-kilometer (190 mi) metro is under construction. Construction work on the Msheireb station—planned as the hub between—October 10, 2012, to mark the start of work on the key terminal station at Msheireb, which will form the hub of the Doha metro network. The system will include commuter lines, four light rail lines, and a people mover. In August Qatar Rail signed five contracts totaling 1.48 billion riyals for work on the first phase of the metro, which covers 129 route-kilometers including the Red, Green, and Gold lines. The contracts were awarded to Porr/Saudi Binladin/HBK Contracting (enabling works), Jacobs Engineering (Red Line), Louis Berger/Egis Group (Gold Line and main stations), Hill International (Green Line), and Lloyd's Register (safety assessment). According to the CEO of Qatar Rail, Phase 1 is due to open in the fourth quarter of 2019, well ahead of the 2022 FIFA World Cup.

Overall, Doha Metro will consist of four lines: in addition to the aforementioned Red Line, Gold Line, and Green Line which will be built in the first phase, the Blue Line is expected to be completed in the second phase. Msheireb Station will be the point of intersection for all of the metro lines.

The Red Line (also known as Coast Line) will extend through Doha, running from Al Wakrah to Al Khor. It is separated into two divisions: Red Line North and Red Line South. The former will run from Mushayrib Station to Al Khor City, over a length of 55.7 km. Doha Metro's Green Line will connect Doha to Education City and is also known as the Education Line. Starting in Old Airport, the Gold Line (also known as Historic Line) will end in Al Rayyan and cover a distance of 30.6 km. Lastly, the Blue Line, or City Line, will only cover the city of Doha, and is planned to be circular with a length of 17.5 km.

Lusail LRT

The city of Lusail, which is located approximately  north of Doha's city center, is getting a light rail transit system comprising 25 stations over . It will connect to the Doha metro. The opening of the Lusail LRT is expected for 2020.

West Bay Tram
Doha's West Bay neighborhood is also getting a transit system, an  catenary-free tramway, which will also serve Education City. The turnkey-system, constructed by Siemens and utilizing its latest Avenio tramcars with supercapacitor technology, was opened on 24 December 2019.

Gulf Railway

The Gulf Railway is a proposed railway project that would connect the six Arab member states of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)—Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates—of the Persian Gulf. The regional network would be  long. It is planned to be operational by 2017. A monorail system is expected to be the first to open, and will carry passengers between Bahrain and Saudi Arabia. According to initial planning documents, the metro lines will be mostly underground, which could be a challenge for engineers due to the high water table.

Aviation

Doha International Airport was Qatar's International airport until 2014. It was the hub of Qatar Airways, and was also served by many other International airlines. Because of the rapid growth in Qatar and the rapid growth of Qatar Airways, the airport was deemed too small and inadequate for the traffic that went through. This problem was addressed with a large expansion that was made in anticipation of the 15th Asian Games. The airport's facilities were expanded significantly, including the construction of a separate first and business class terminal. Furthermore, parking bays had been constructed on the opposite side of the runway to handle additional air traffic. All these changes had temporarily eased the problem but because of the airport's small size and limited space for expansion, it was not effective to permanently solve the crowding problem.

Hamad International Airport constructed about 4 km East of the former airport replaced it as the only International airport in Qatar This airport has been partially built out at sea on 60% reclaimed land. Next to the airport 100 hectares have been set aside for an Airport City. Commenced in 2006, the initial phases of the airport are completed and the third phase is ongoing. It received its first passengers in 2014 and when completed it will be able to accommodate around 50 million passengers annually. The new airport is located on the shore, further away from the central areas of the city than the current airport, reducing noise and environmental pollution. 2 parallel runways are operational, the western one being the eighth longest in the world at 4850 meters. The airport's 600,000 sq m passenger terminal has a check-in hall that comprises a 25,000 sq m column-free space with around 130 check-in counters. One of the largest maintenance hangars worldwide is located at the airport said to be able to cater to 13 aircraft at once. This airport is also one of the first ever designed specifically for the double-deck Airbus A380.

It is a motorized vehicle with an attachment that can rapidly gather and cut a tree before felling it.

Feller is a traditional name for someone who cuts down trees, and bunching is the skidding and assembly of two or more trees. A feller buncher performs both of these harvesting functions and consists of a standard heavy equipment base with a tree-grabbing device furnished with a chain-saw, circular saw or a shear—a pinching device designed to cut small trees off at the base. The machine then places the cut tree on a stack suitable for a skidder, forwarder, or yarder for transport to further processing such as delimbing, bucking, loading, or chipping.

Some wheeled feller bunchers lack an articulated arm, and must drive close to a tree to grasp it.

In cut-to-length logging a harvester performs the tasks of a feller buncher and additionally does delimbing and bucking.

Components and Felling attachment 
Feller buncher is either tracked or wheeled and has self-levelling cabin and matches with different felling heads. For steep terrain, tracked feller buncher is being used because it provides high level of traction to the steep slope and also has high level of stability. For flat terrain, wheeled feller buncher is more efficient compared to tracked feller buncher. It is common that levelling cabins are matched with both wheeled and tracked feller buncher for steep terrain as it provides operator comfort and helps keeping the standard of tree felling production. The size and type of trees determine which type of felling heads being used.

Types of felling heads 
Disc Saw Head – It can provide a high speed of cutting when the head is pushed against the tree. Then, the clamp arms will hold the tree when the tree is almost completed cutting. It is able to cut and gather multiple trees in the felling head. The disc saw head with good ground speed could provide high production which allows it to keep more than one skidders working continuously.

Shear Blade Head -  It is placed against the tree and the clamp arms will hold the tree firmly. Then, the blade will activate and start cutting the tree. Same as disc saw head, it can hold multiple trees before they are placed on the ground.

Chain Saw Head – The floppy head provides minimal control to place the trees on the ground. It might not suit to collect the cut trees or gather the cut stems in the felling head.

Productivity 
Comparing other harvesting systems such as chainsaw and harvester, feller buncher has the relatively high productivity among them. The weekly production of the feller buncher was 627 cubic meters of usable logs, while the chainsaw system and harvester system could produce 163 cubic meters and 239 cubic meters respectively. There are several factors affecting the level of productivity of the feller buncher. They include characteristics of stand, terrain conditions, operation location, and the performance of the operator. Many studies indicated that the trees size and the gradient of the slope are the major factors impacting the overall productivity. There was a research suggested that productivity has a significant positive relationship with the tree size which means the larger stem size, larger tree height or larger diameter at breast height (DBH) results in a high productivity of the feller buncher. Terrain conditions such as ground slope and terrain roughness have a significant negative relationship to the productivity of feller buncher which means the steeper of the land or rough terrain condition can bring negative effect to the productivity. One of the studies had found that feller buncher might reduce its productivity when performing operation on a very uneven surface with slopes of more than 20%. However, larger tree size does not necessarily lead to high productivity. The same study compared the operation time when performing clear-cut of the stands with two different average DBH, 24.6 cm and 34.3 cm respectively. Result showed that the productivity when operating the second stand decreased by 32.3% because the time consumption was doubled when larger stands required two-stage of cutting operation.

Cost-effectiveness

The purchase cost of a feller buncher is around $180,000 and its fuel consumption and lubricant consumption is high among other mechanical harvesting equipment. The feller buncher also has the highest hourly cost which is around $99.5 when comparing other equipment such as a harvesters and grapple skidders. Although the total cost of feller buncher is high in overall, the unit production price is the lowest which explains why feller buncher is considered the most cost-effective harvesting equipment. The average unit cost of the feller buncher is $12.1/m3 while the unit cost of the harvesters is $16.5/m3. The unit cost of the feller buncher is primary affected by the tree size and the tree volume. The unit felling cost is lower when the tree size increased. For example, tree with 5 inches at DBH has the unit cost of $70 while tree with 15 inches at DBH has the unit cost of $12. As the cost of feller buncher is high, only large tree volume can produce more profit to cover the high average cost. In terms of stump height, lower stump height can maximise the use of natural resources and prevent wood waste. Mechanical felling such as using feller buncher can prevent 30% of value loss caused by the high stumps.

Maintenance 
Feller buncher requires daily maintenance before operation and some components only require periodic maintenance. It could ensure the safety of operators and all the workers around the operation. If damaged or faulty machine is operated, it could result in further damage to the machine which can be more expensive to repair.

Daily or Every 8 hours

Lubricant 
The felling head is considered one of the hardest part of the feller buncher and it is necessary to apply lubricant to every joint for daily maintenance. It is suggested to apply lubricant to saw head clamps, wrist attachment and driveshaft bearings during every maintenance. The use of grease should meet the extreme pressure performance standard and contains 3% of molybdenum disulphide (MoS2). MoS2 can prevent the wear takes place where the metal to metal contact exists.

Fuel 
It is also important to check if there is enough fuel for the operation. Feller bunchers use diesel fuel to generate power. In most of the cases, the fuel is preferably to have cetane number greater than 50 (minimum 40). This is suitable when undergo operation for temperature below -20 °C (-4 °F) or elevations more than 1500m (5000 Ft.). The Cloud Point of the fuel is preferably at least 5 °C (9 °F) lower than the expected low temperature. It is also suggested that the sulphur content of the fuel should not be more than 0.5% as it could reduce 50% of the service interval for the engine oil and filter.

Engine Coolant 
Operators have the responsibility to check the engine coolant level of the feller buncher before starting the engine. The coolant prevents cylinder linear erosion and pitting, and provides protection during extremely low temperature for up to -37 °C (-34 °F). It is recommended to use coolants for heavy-duty engines which are relatively low silicate ethylene glycol base. There are two forms of coolants: pre-diluted coolant or coolant concentrate. Water is required to dilute the concentrated coolant with an approximate ratio of 50:50. The use of supplemental coolant addictive might be also required in the concentrated coolant in order to provide protection against corrosion. Distilled, deionised, or demineralised water is suggested for mixing the concentrated coolant because when some water compositions mix with other substances could form a precipitate, causing damage or blockage in the engine.

Risk management approach 
During maintenance, there are common working hazards related to two main areas: working environment and exhaust system. When working on the exhaust system, be aware of the hot components around the engine. Workers could wear personal protective equipment such as safety spectacles, heat-proof gloves and safety boots. When feller buncher is elevated for service or maintenance, falls from height might happen. Related injuries could be avoided by ensuring dryness of all the walking surface, wiping any oils or other liquid substances on the floor. Also, ensure the feller buncher is parked on a level and stable ground during maintenance. When getting in and out of the machinery, workers are suggested to use three point of contact with two hands holding the handrails and one foot on a step. It is also important to provide sufficient lighting for all the working sites at all time of service.

Safety

Logging is considered one of the most dangerous occupations. This is because many loggers are injured by the falling objects which are large in size and heavy. “Struck by object” is the most common injuries that reported in the logging industry due to the manual use of equipment during the logging procedures. There is evidence that using mechanized harvesting equipment could reduce the rate of “struck by” injuries. One study indicates that total injury claims could be reduced by 14.2%, while the “struck by” injuries could be reduced by 8.2%, when comparing the changes before and after the use of feller buncher. The significant decline in the number of “struck by” injuries after using the feller buncher in the logging companies supported the statement that using mechanized harvesting equipment could lessen overall injuries. The evidence also found that the rate of injuries in the logging companies without using feller bunchers had increased slightly throughout a period of time, increasing from 14.5% to 17.5%, in five years. In terms of trees fatality, areas with lower levels of mechanization in harvesting resulted in higher rate of trees fatality. For instance, in Eastern areas of the United States, research which compared the conventional and mechanized logging operations, indicated the number of injuries, when using the conventional approach, is three times greater than that of using the mechanized equipment such as a feller buncher. However, mechanized related injury could be raised accordingly, especially when performing machine maintenance or repair. These kinds of injuries could be serious and also costly.

Limitations
Feller buncher could be highly productive and cost-effective but there are several limitations. Feller buncher is less beneficial when performing operations on a very rough and relatively steep land. For example, in Appalachian hardwood area, trees have heavy crowns and are grown on the steep slopes which requires tracked feller bunchers in the operations. Although tracked feller bunchers allow operations on a steep slope, the cost-effectiveness is not well studied. Also, manual felling can operate on the steeper slopes than the feller bunchers do. On the other hand, feller bunchers are cost-effective only when there is a high volume of trees in the operations. If there is not enough timber to harvest, the unit cost can be expansive, especially when the majority of the operation site is steep slopes. A 2013, University of Maine study suggests that the use of feller bunchers could cause medium to high level of stand damage from 7% to 25%.  However, in comparison with other equipment such as harvesters, the damage that caused by the feller bunchers are less severe.

He served as the Deputy Leader of the CHP responsible for foreign relations between 3 November 2014 and 11 November 2015. He was part of the CHP delegation during coalition negotiations with the Justice and Development Party following the June 2015 general election. Before entering politics, Özçelik served as the Turkish Consul General at Shanghai from 1997 to 1998, as the Turkish Ambassador to Iraq from 2009 to 2011 and as the Undersecretary of Public Order and Security from 2011 to 2012.

Early life and career
Murat Özçelik was born on 1 January 1954 in Ankara and graduated from TED Ankara College before going on to study at the Department of Management at the Middle East Technical University (OTDÜ) Faculty of Economics and Administrative Sciences. He is married with two children.

Civil service career
Özçelik started working at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 1983. Between 1990 and 1992, he served as the Cabinet Chief for Turgut Özal, the then-President of Turkey. After serving at numerous other positions, he became the department manager at the Office of Information in 2005, serving concurrently as the foreign affairs deputy spokesperson. On 16 November 2011, he was appointed as the Undersecretary of Public Order and Security. Following a public statement by Özçelik, in which he claimed that he was being pressured into not doing his job the way he wanted and that he wanted to resign, the government removed him from the position on 17 May 2012. He was subsequently appointed as an advisor at the Foreign Ministry and subsequently retired there.

Diplomatic career
In January 1997, Özçelik became the first Turkish Consul General at Shanghai, a position in which he served until 22 September 1998.

Özçelik was always one of the trusted career diplomats that top level government officials knew and worked with. He served as Turkey’s special representative in Iraq from 2007 to 2011 and then as Turkey’s ambassador to Baghdad. During this period, he was in the close circle of advisors that contacted the Iraqi Kurds and prepared the ground to improve strategic relations between Turkey, Iraq and the Iraqi Kurds. Reconciliation with the Iraqi Kurds inaugurated a period of economic and political cooperation that is counted among Turkey’s most significant foreign policy wins in the Middle East.

Political career
Özçelik was a candidate to become a member of the Party Council of the Republican People's Party (CHP) during the party's 18th Extraordinary Convention held on 7 September 2014. However, he failed to win enough votes to enter the council, resulting in the party leader Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu appointing him as a personal advisor. It was alleged that Özçelik had stated in a closed meeting that he had voted for the Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP), though had the support of Kılıçdaroğlu since it was perceived that Kılıçdaroğlu wanted to give the task of forming a strong foreign policy to Özçelik. Numerous members of the party council who won a higher number of votes subsequently resigned from their positions in order to allow Özçelik to take a seat, which he did in October 2014. On 3 November 2014, he was appointed as the Deputy Leader of the CHP responsible for foreign relations. In the June 2015 general election, he was elected as a Member of Parliament for İstanbul's third electoral district. During a Party Council meeting on 24 August 2015, it was alleged that Özçelik had an argument with rival council member Durdu Özbolat, developing into a fight between the two men. This, as well as the fact that Özçelik had not been elected through a nomination primary before the June 2015 election, allegedly contributed to Kılıçdaroğlu's decision to not put him forward as a candidate for the November 2015 general election. Özçelik subsequently resigned his Deputy Leader position, but withdrew his resignation shortly after. He resigned as Deputy Leader and from the Party Council on 11 November 2015.

Controversy
Pro-status quo Turkish nationalists within the CHP were uneasy with Özçelik’s foreign policy activism in urging reconciliation with Iraqi Kurds. He was targeted by allegations launched by hawkish CHP nationalists that claimed he sympathised with the pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP). In an attempt to discredit his credibility within the CHP, far-right Turkish media claimed that he, his family and his friends voted for the HDP in the June 2015 general election. This claim was rejected by Özçelik as false.

Among other actions while representing the United States in Switzerland he signed documents committing the United States to be part of the World Court.  The United States Senate later put so many restrictions and conditions on US entry into the World Court that the other nations participating in it refused to allow the United States to join.

Biography
Stovall was the son of Bolling Anthony Stovall, a cotton broker, and his wife the former Martha Wilson.  Stovall grew up in Augusta, Georgia and was a boyhood friend of Woodrow Wilson, who would later, as President, appoint him as an ambassador. When Stovall was sixteen his family moved to Athens, Georgia. He was educated at Richmond Academy and the University of Georgia graduating from the latter in 1875.

Stovall married Mary Ganahl (1861–1951).

In the late 1880s Stovall was editor of the Augusta Chronicle.  In 1891 Stovall founded the Savannah Press, a newspaper in Savannah that he served as editor and owner of.  This paper was later renamed the Savannah Evening Press.  The paper later merged with the Savannah Morning News.

Stovall served as a member of the Georgia State Legislature from 1902–1906 and from 1912 until he resigned to become United States ambassador to Switzerland.  He was a member of the Democratic Party and served as a delegate to the Democratic national Convention in 1924.

He died in 1935.

Legacy
Stovall wrote a biography of Robert Toombs in the 1890s and a book on Switzerland largely drawing on his experience as US ambassador there that was published posthumously in 1939.

It was originally released in January 1988 by Jive and Arista as the follow-up to Ocean's critically and commercially successful 1986 album Love Zone.

Background
The album's title is a reference to then-President Ronald Reagan's ""tear down this wall"" speech. It features guest backing vocals from artists including The Manhattans, Will Downing, Carroll Thompson, and Mary Cassidy, and is generally regarded as the culmination of the smoother, more adult-oriented sound of Ocean's later work.

One of Ocean's most commercially successful solo albums, it went on to peak at #3 on the UK Albums Chart and reached #18 on the US Billboard 200. The album launched four charting singles in the UK: ""Get Outta My Dreams, Get Into My Car""  peaked at #3 on the UK Singles Chart; ""Calypso Crazy"" peaked at #35; ""The Colour of Love"" at #65 and ""Stand and Deliver"" at #97.

""Get Outta My Dreams, Get Into My Car"" was Ocean's third and final #1 hit on the Billboard US Pop chart, and his fourth and final #1 R&B hit in that country. The song topped pop charts in several other countries, including Australia, Belgium, Canada, Ireland, the Netherlands, and Norway. ""The Colour Of Love"" was a top 20 pop hit in the US and Canada, and Ocean's tenth and final top-10 hit on the US R&B chart.

Tear Down These Walls was released in 39 versions, including a unique Mini CD version (three 3"" CDs) for the UK.

The album was re-released on 16 June 2014 on Cherry Pop featuring rare bonus content. The reissue is a 2-CD set with the original album digitally remastered from the original 1/2"" mix tapes; the bonus content consists of associated 7"", and 12"" mixes.

Critical reception
On release, the album received generally favourable reviews by music critics. In a retrospective review for AllMusic, critic Ron Wynn gave the album three out of five stars and wrote that ""While he was still a successful attraction, this album wouldn't reach the multi-platinum levels of its predecessors."" also noting that ""Ocean's voice also lacked the resonance and authority it had on earlier dance tunes and wasn't as convincing or confident on ballads.""

Arrayed around the head of its harbor, the town's most significant period of development was in the mid 19th century, because of lime processing and other industries.  The town has a well-preserved collection of Greek Revival and Italianate architecture from that period.  The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976.

Description and history
The area that is now Rockport was originally part of Megunticook Plantation, which was settled in the 1760s and incorporated as Camden in 1791.  The Rockport area was called Goose River, but was renamed Rockport in 1852 and separated from Camden in 1891.  Its small harbor was an early shipbuilding center, and in the 19th century became an important center of ice harvesting and the extraction of lime.  Its fortunes declined late in the 19th century, but were boosted by the start of the summer tourist trade.

The historic district is arrayed along a series of roads that curve around the head of Rockport's harbor.  Its principal roads are Pascal Avenue, from School Street in the west to Main Street, Main Street from Summer to Central Streets, and Central Street and Russell Avenues to Winter Street.  The district further extends a short distance along streets that cross these, and include clusters of residential streets north of Pascal and east of Main Street.  It covers  and includes 127 buildings.  The majority of them are wood frame residences, in some combination of Greek Revival and Italianate styling.  Prominent commercial buildings include the 1835 Granite Block on Main Street, and the Romanesque brick Carleton-Shepherd Block, built in 1891.

Van Quickenborne is best known as the founder of St. Louis University. He became a Jesuit in Ghent, Belgium in 1815, and, at his request, was sent to the American Missions in 1817. He was appointed Superior and Novice Master of the Jesuit novitiate in White Marsh, Maryland, in 1819.

Westward
In the early 1820s the Bishop of the Louisiana Territory, Louis Du Bourg, invited the Society of Jesus to come to the newly admitted state of Missouri. In 1823, twelve young Belgian Jesuits traveled to Missouri with six African-American slaves: Moses and Nancy, Thomas and Molly, Isaac and Susan, each husband and wife. The Jesuits forced the enslaved couples to leave their children behind; they expected their slaves would produce more children in Missouri.

Saint Louis University
Father van Quickenbourne had opened St. Regis Seminary, a school for young Indian boys, at Florissant, Mo. in May 1824. In late 1824 he wrote to the Superior General of the Jesuits about opening a college in St. Louis on land he had purchased at auction. The beginnings of Saint Louis University as a Jesuit institution may be dated from the period (second half of 1825) at which white students were first received by Father van Quickenborne at St. Regis Seminary.

First recorded Kansas baptism
The following is the first certified baptism:
""A neosho chez Mr. Ligueste Chouteau"", (at Neosho in the home of Mr. Ligueste Chouteau), 27 August 1827, Father Van Quickenborne baptized Henri Mongrain, ""Son of Noel pere and of Tonpapai, age two years, sponsor Mr. Ligueste P. Chouteau"" (baptismal register, St. Ferdinand's church, Florissant, Missouri). Father Van Quickenborne said the first verifiable Mass in Kansas two days earlier at St. Paul in Neosho County.   
In 1837, Father Van Quickenborne baptized 14 Indian children in a Potawatomi camp just outside Fort Leavenworth.

Death
Father Charles Felix Van Quickenborne died on 17 August 1837 at age 49 and is buried at Florissant, Missouri. 

His missionary work among the Kickapoos was taken over by the Dutch Jesuit Father Christian Hoecken.

One of the world's leading clay court players in the 1990s, he won the 1995 French Open and at his peak was called ""The King of Clay"". In addition, he won eight Masters 1000 Series titles. Muster is one of the nine players to win Super 9/ATP Masters Series/ATP World Tour Masters 1000 titles on clay, hardcourt and carpet.

With his 1995 French Open title, Muster became the first Austrian to win a Grand Slam singles title, followed by Dominic Thiem at the 2020 US Open.

Tennis career

Juniors
Muster first came to prominence when he reached the final of the French Open junior tournament and the Orange Bowl juniors tournament in 1985.

Pro tour
Muster played his first matches at the top-level in 1984, as a junior player, at the age of 16. In 1984, he played his first match for Austria in the Davis Cup. He also played at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, and in two tournaments on Austrian soil, the clay-court event in Kitzbühel and the indoor carpet event in Vienna.

Muster turned professional in 1985, regularly playing in Challenger tournaments throughout the year, winning in Belo Horizonte, as well as continuing to play in many top-level tournaments. Muster won his first top-level tournament at the Dutch Open in Hilversum in 1986.

In 1988, Muster reached six top-level tournament finals, winning four of them, in Boston, Bordeaux, Prague and Bari. Muster finished the year ranked 16th in the world.

Early in 1989, he became the first Austrian to reach the semifinals of the Australian Open, eventually losing in four sets to world No. 1, Ivan Lendl. Shortly after that, he became the first Austrian to reach the world top 10. On the night of 31 March 1989, he defeated Yannick Noah in five sets in the semifinals of the Lipton International Players Championships in Key Biscayne, Florida, to set up a final against Lendl. However, in the early hours of 1 April 1989, just hours after his semifinal victory, he was struck by a drunk driver, severing ligaments in his left knee and forcing him to default the final. Muster flew back to Vienna to undergo surgery. With the aid of a special chair designed to allow him to practice hitting balls while recovering from knee surgery, he returned to competitive tennis in September 1989.

Muster's comeback continued in 1990, when he won three top-level tournaments on clay (including the Italian Open, defeating Andrés Gómez in the semifinals and Andrei Chesnokov in the final) and one title on hardcourt. Muster reached the semifinals of the 1990 French Open, losing in straight sets to the eventual champion, Andrés Gómez. He also helped Austria reach the semifinals of the Davis Cup, where they were eliminated 3–2 by the United States, despite winning both of his singles rubbers against Michael Chang and Andre Agassi. That year, he was named the ATP Tour's ""Comeback Player of the Year.""

In 1990, Muster won the Austrian Sportsman of the Year award.

Muster won two more top-level tournaments in 1991, and three more in 1992 (all on clay courts), with the biggest of these titles being the 1992 Monte Carlo title, where he defeated Aaron Krickstein in the final. In 1993, Muster won seven titles. Muster's win–loss record on clay in 1993 was 55–10, although he failed to win any of the four big clay-court events of the year.

At both the 1992 and 1993 French Opens, Muster was defeated by the reigning French Open and Australian Open champion Jim Courier. At the 1994 French Open, he won his second round match against Andre Agassi in five sets but was then defeated by the serve-and-volley play of Patrick Rafter in the next round, with Rafter's four set victory denying Muster a match against the reigning French Open champion Sergi Bruguera.

Muster won three clay-court titles in 1994. In March 1994, he defeated Michael Stich of Germany in a first round Davis Cup tie in Graz, 6–4, 6–7, 4–6, 6–3, 12–10, after saving a match point when trailing at 7–8 in the fifth set. Despite Muster's win over Stich bringing Austria level at 2–2 in the tie, it was Germany who eventually won the decisive fifth rubber.

In 1995, Muster enjoyed the best year of his career winning 12 tournaments, with 11 of those tournaments won on clay-courts. Between February and June 1995, Muster won 40 consecutive matches on clay (the longest winning streak on the surface since Björn Borg had won 46 matches between 1977 and 1979). At the 1995 Monte Carlo Masters, he defeated Andrea Gaudenzi in the semifinals, despite struggling heavily in the latter stages of the match due to having a shortage of glucose in his blood and suffering a 40° fever, which required a brief spell in hospital after the match. The next day, he won the final against Boris Becker, after a tough match, by 4–6, 5–7, 6–1, 7–6, 6–0, with Muster surviving two championship points in the fourth set tiebreak, the first of which saw Becker double-faulting after going for a big second serve. He went on to win his second Italian Open title, defeating Sergi Bruguera in the final. At the 1995 French Open, Muster won his first and only Grand Slam singles title, defeating Yevgeny Kafelnikov in the semifinals and comfortably beating 1989 champion Michael Chang in the final. Muster was the only Austrian to win a Grand Slam singles title until Dominic Thiem won the 2020 US Open. His win–loss record on clay in 1995 was a remarkable 65–2. Although his record on other surfaces was less impressive, a late season victory over Pete Sampras on fast indoor carpet, during his run to the title of the Masters event in Germany, gave Muster an outside chance at finishing the year no. 1; however, Sampras finished the year at no. 1. Of the 12 tournaments that Muster won in 1995, Muster saved at least one match point held against him during six of them, with those six tournaments being held in Estoril, Barcelona, Monte Carlo, St. Pölten, Stuttgart Outdoor and Umag.

In 1995, Muster won the Austrian Sportsman of the Year award for the second time.

Muster continued to rack up clay-court victories in 1996. He won seven tournaments, six of them titles he successfully defended after winning them the year before. These 1996 tournament victories included his third Monte Carlo title, where he defeated clay court specialist Albert Costa in the final, and his third Italian Open title, defeating Richard Krajicek in the final. Muster's win–loss record on clay in 1996 was an impressive 46–3. This made his 1995–96 record on the surface 111–5, which was, at the time, the best two-year clay-court record since the open era began in 1968. Despite Muster's continued dominance on clay-courts in 1996, he was upset in the Round of 16 at the 1996 French Open, losing to eventual finalist Michael Stich. In July 1996, in the final of the 1996 Mercedes Cup in Stuttgart, Muster defeated the French Open champion Yevgeny Kafelnikov in three straight sets.

In February 1996, Muster attained the world no. 1 ranking for the first time. He held the ranking initially for just one week, and then regained it for five weeks over March and April 1996. The validity of Muster's number one ranking was called into question by top Americans Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi, who argued that he had achieved the top spot based almost solely on his clay court results, although Muster had beaten Sampras on indoor carpet at the 1995 Masters event in Germany, and Agassi had only won tournaments on hardcourt in 1995.

In 1997, Muster enjoyed the best results of his career on hardcourt. He reached the semifinals of the 1997 Australian Open, losing to eventual champion Pete Sampras. He then went on to win the tournament in Dubai, defeating Goran Ivanišević in the final. Muster went on to win his biggest title on hardcourt at the 1997 Miami Masters, the same tournament where his career had nearly ended eight years earlier, by defeating Sergi Bruguera in three straight sets in the final, after Bruguera had defeated Sampras in the semifinals. Muster was also the runner-up at the Cincinnati Masters, where he lost in the final to Sampras. He achieved a 29–8 win–loss record on hardcourt during 1997, although he only won nine out of 18 matches on clay in the same year. Muster's 1997 French Open campaign ended in the third round, when the unseeded Gustavo Kuerten, then ranked at 66 in the world, defeated him. Kuerten went on to win the 1997 French Open title and usher in a new era on clay.

Muster reached his last top-level tournament final in Estoril (on clay) in 1998, losing to Alberto Berasategui. At the 1998 French Open, Muster reached the quarterfinals, before losing to Félix Mantilla in four sets, with Mantilla getting revenge for his 1998 Italian Open defeat. Muster's 1998 results faded after the spring, as he reached just one semifinal (Mallorca), and one quarterfinal (Boston), for the remainder of the year. Muster opened 1999 with a semifinal showing in Sydney, but then struggled over the next few months, winning just 2 of his 12 matches after Sydney. Following his first-round loss to Nicolás Lapentti at the 1999 French Open, he hung up his racquet at the age of 31. Muster remains the only world No. 1 singles player who has never managed to win a men's singles match at Wimbledon throughout his whole career.

Muster only lost one Davis Cup singles match on clay in his career, when Goran Ivanišević defeated him in April 1997, 6–7, 7–5, 6–7, 6–2, 7–5, despite Muster having won 112 of his previous 117 matches on clay going into the match. Muster's overall Davis Cup win–loss record, counting both singles and doubles matches, was 45–18. Muster's win–loss record in Davis Cup singles matches was 36–8, while his win–loss record in Davis Cup singles matches on clay was 29–1. Muster has more match wins in Davis Cup than any other Austrian tennis player.

After he stopped playing tennis after the 1999 French Open, Muster moved to Noosa Heads, Australia, where he had officially resided since 1996, and married television presenter Jo Beth Taylor in 2000. The couple have a son, Christian, who was born in 2001. Muster and Taylor separated in 2002 and divorced in 2005. In 2003, Muster moved back to Austria, to work as a coach and captain of the Austrian Davis Cup team. He has played tennis on the ATP Champions Tour. In April 2010, Muster married Caroline Ofner, and they have a daughter, Maxim, who was born in 2009.

On 16 June 2010, at the age of 42, Muster announced his comeback to professional tennis. In July 2010, he played the first match of his comeback in a Challenger tournament in Braunschweig, where he lost in the first round. He went on to play in three Challenger tournaments in Kitzbühel, Como, and Rijeka. Eventually, in his fifth Challenger tournament in Ljubljana, Muster won his first comeback match, against Borut Puc of Croatia, which brought Muster back into the ATP singles ranking list at world number 988. Muster finished 2010 ranked at world number 980.

On 13 September 2011, Muster won a second match after his comeback, in the Todi Challenger, against the fifth seeded Argentinian Leonardo Mayer. His next opponent was countryman Martin Fischer, to whom Muster lost. On 19 September 2011, Muster reached world No. 847. He then lost his next match, at the Challenger tournament in Palermo, to Alessio di Mauro.

In October 2011, at the age of 44, Muster decided that he would play his last tennis match before retirement at the top-level Vienna tournament, where Muster lost to countryman, Dominic Thiem, in straight sets. However, three weeks after playing in Vienna, Muster was back again, this time in a Challenger tournament in Salzburg, playing against Dennis Blömke. He lost a close three-set battle. This was his last match to date.

Equipment
During his prime in the 1990s, Muster wore Lotto clothing. From 1986 to 1993, Muster played with the Head Prestige Pro 600 racquet. During the summer of 1993, he switched to playing with the Head Prestige 600 racquet. During 1994 and 1995, Muster played with the Head Pro Tour 630 racquet. At the start of 1996, he switched to using a Kneissl racquet, which was closely modelled on his old Pro Tour 630. At the start of 1997, he switched his racquet again to the white Kneissl Tom's Reach Machine racquet, which had a longer handle and a 28-inch frame. In 1998, he used his Kneissl Tom's Reach Machine racquet on hardcourt, grass and carpet, but went back to his old 1996 Kneissl racquet on clay.

When Muster came back to the ATP Tour in 2010, he used the Head Pro Tour 630 racquet, before switching to the Babolat AeroPro Drive GT racquet, and then went back to the Head Pro Tour 630 racquet again before playing his last matches in late 2011. Muster wore Adidas clothing throughout his comeback.

Records 
In the 1995 season, Muster won 12 men's singles tournament titles, a record for the ATP Tour (since 1990). In 2006 Roger Federer tied the record.

Muster has the highest winning percentage of singles tournament finals of all players who reached a minimum of 25 finals. Of his 55 finals, he won 44 with 11 defeats (80%).

She worked on the Karonga Prevention Study on HIV and Tuberculosis in Malawi. She is also a sculptor.

Education and early career 
Glynn completed an MSc in Epidemiology at London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine in 1990. She completed her PhD in infectious diseases in 1993.

Career 
Glynn has worked in Malawi, Sierra Leone and South Africa. She studies the relationship between education and health. She has conducted several large-scale studies into the prevalence of infectious diseases in Africa. Glynn studies the relationship between mycobacterium tuberculosis and HIV. In 1998, Glynn studied the resurgence of tuberculous and how it was impacted by HIV infection. She monitored the Beijing genotype of mycobacterium tuberculosis for seven years in Malawi. She hypothesised that it may have originated from Chinese agricultural advisors. She continued to monitor tuberculosis in Malawi for several decades. She began to monitor the association of HIV and educational attainment in Thailand and Africa. She found that in Thailand, more schooling resulted in less infection, whereas in Africa higher attainment resulted in a greater risk. She discussed her work on sequencing the mycobacterium tuberculosis genome on the eLife podcast.

She was awarded a Department of Health Public Health Career Scientist Award in 2002. In 2008 Glynn edited the book HIV, Resurgent Infections and Population Change in Africa. She identified that access to free HIV/AIDS drugs resulted in a significant reduction of adult mortality rates. Glynn went on to study how the menarche impacted the prevalence of herpes simplex.  In 2015 she ran a free three-week course in the science of ebola. The course was made available on FutureLearn. She monitored recrudescence of severe Ebola in Western Africa. Since 2016, Glynn has been a member of the Public Health England Rapid Support Team.

Using the anti-glycoprotein IgG capture assay, Glynn demonstrated that asymptomatic Ebola virus infection occurs but would have little impact on herd immunity. She used data from 2007 to 2016 to show that failure in the early stages of school in Malawi could be used to predict pregnancy and marriage.

Sculpture 
Glynn is sculptor. She uses her sculpture to illustrate human life and interactions. For the Bloomsbury Festival, Glynn created a mobile sculpture that visualised Indo-European languages. She has exhibited in Hampton Court Palace and Clare Hall, Cambridge. In Aspects of Life, Glynn used wire, bronze and giant sea pods to depict chromosomes.

Origin 
The term's origin is often attributed to hacker culture theorist Richard Stallman (though he denies coining it) to contrast the exploitative hacker with the white hat hacker who hacks protectively by drawing attention to vulnerabilities in computer systems that require repair. The black/white hat terminology originates in the Western genre of popular American culture, in which black and white hats denote villainous  and heroic cowboys respectively, to resemble the contrast of good and evil. The black versus white hat dichotomy was also prominently displayed in the Spy versus Spy cartoon in Mad Magazine.

Black hat hackers are the stereotypical illegal hacking groups often portrayed in popular culture, and are ""the epitome of all that the public fears in a computer criminal"". Black hat hackers break into secure networks and systems with the motive of destroying, modifying, or stealing  some sensitive data, or to make the networks unusable for authorized network users.

Unlike the white hat hackers, black hat hackers do not have any common and standardized code or internal regulation. Albeit, there exist some forms of organization: black hat call centers, malicious software resellers and vendors.

Reed became known for his fiddle tunes only after Alan Jabbour and the Hollow Rock String Band spread his music. Reed never had a professional career as a fiddler but was able to influence many other musicians through a relationship with his apprentice Alan Jabbour.

Early life
Henry Reed was born in Monroe County, West Virginia on April 28, 1884. He was the youngest of the eight children of Marion Reed and Sophia Catherine Underwood Reed. Reed grew up in Monroe County in a large extended family and spent most of his life in the surrounding area. At the age of 23 Reed married Nettie Ann Virginia Mullins on December 11, 1907. They settled down in Glen Lyn, Virginia. Reed spent the next few years working at the Appalachian Power plant and raising his family, which eventually grew to twelve children.

Career
Reed is one of the few Appalachian musicians that became known for his music without playing professionally. Reed was recognized for his fiddling shortly after meeting Alan Jabbour in 1966. Jabbour was an apprentice to Reed, listening, recording and learning Reed's tunes on the Fiddle and harmonica. Alan Jabbour's band, the Hollow Rock String Band, used many of Reed's tunes in their music. As the band played Reed's tunes at more shows he became more of a public figure, and eventually began to be recognized for his music. In 1968, the Hollow Rock String band released a long-playing record, The Hollow Rock String Band: Traditional Dance Tunes. This record was made up of many tunes from Reed. The tune ""Over the Waterfall"" was produced by the Hollow Strings Band and is one of Reed's most well-known compositions.

Fiddle Technique
Reed's tunes include a variety of genres. According to Alan Jabbour's recordings, Reed often played ""classic tunes, classic vintage, waltzes, schottisches, clogs, rag-like pieces from both grassroots and popular sources and several marches from the nineteenth-century fifing tradition."" Not all of the techniques Reed used to produce these genres were common among many fiddlers. Reed held the fiddle under his chin allowing his left hand to be free. Freeing up his left hand made it possible for him to achieve notes in the third position which included keys like a high D or C. Reed also had a particular way of holding the bow at the frog rather than choking it up higher like other fiddlers do. By gripping the bow on the frog Reed was able to achieve slurs into his playing; This style was referred to as the ""longbow style."" Slurs are multiple notes in the same stroke of the bow allowing for a more diverse sound to come from the fiddle.  The most unusual feature of his bow technique was the placement of his fifth finger underneath the nut rather than on the top of it.

Death
Reed Died at the age of 84 on February 8, 1968 due to a blood clot. The blood clot that was formed a month after a surgery to have his foot amputated because of an infection. His wife, Nettie died the following year. They are buried next to each other in Pearisburg.

Legacy
Reed's name and legacy continue on through the Henry Reed Fund  and the Annual Henry Reed Memorial Fiddlers Convention.

The Henry Reed Fund was started by Alan Jabbour in 1999. Alan explains why he created this fund by expressing his desire ""to provide support for initiatives benefiting folk artists and taping the collections of the American Folklife Center. In doing so, [the Henry Reed Fund] also commemorates the important cultural process through which the artistry of people like Henry Reed is shared with younger generations and provides continuing enrichment for our cultural life."" The Annual Henry Reed Convention was started in 2003 in honor of Reed. This convention allows fiddlers to get together  in Glen, Virginia once a year to share their music.

He made pioneering contributions to the study of internal friction, anelasticity, crystal defects and other subjects over a fifty-year career and helped develop materials science from a field focused on metals to one that encompasses all classes of materials.

Early career

Nowick was born in Brooklyn, New York, and received his BA degree in Physics in 1943 from Brooklyn College, and MA and PhD degrees in Physics from Columbia University in 1948 and 1950, respectively. During World War II he taught science and engineering in the Army Specialized Training Program at The Johns Hopkins University.  He then moved to Cleveland, where between 1944 and 1946 he worked in a program sponsored by the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (the predecessor to NASA) to create materials that would withstand the heat required for developing jet engines

Nowick returned to New York after World War II, where he completed his doctoral work under S. L. Quimby at Columbia University, obtaining his PhD in 1949. He married Joan Franzblau in 1949, moved to Chicago, and became an instructor at the Institute for the Study of Metals and the University of Chicago. At Chicago he worked for under Clarence Zener, who became his mentor.  In 1951, he joined Yale University as an Assistant Professor, and became Associate Professor there in 1954.

Work at IBM and Columbia University

Nowick made his main contributions while working at IBM and Columbia University. In 1957, he took a position as a manager of metallurgy research at a new IBM Research Center in Yorktown, New York, where he worked until 1966. In this position, he began work on his book Anelastic Relaxation in Crystalline Solids with British scientist Brian Berry. Published in 1972, the book is considered the definitive work on the use of internal friction to study alloy phenomena. Together with Siegfried Mader, Nowick also developed 'vapor quenching', a technique for producing metastable alloys; the development spurred amorphous ferromagnetism as a field of scientific study. In 1996, he published a second book, ""Crystal Properties via Group Theory.""

Later career

In 1966 Nowick returned to Columbia University as Professor of Metallurgy and Materials Science, where he remained until his retirement. Over course of his career he authored more than 200 publications and supervised over 30 PhD students, including MIT professor and materials scientist Harry L. Tuller. He retired from Columbia in 1994, and in 2001 Nowick and his wife moved to California, where he consulted at the University of California at Irvine. He died on 20 July 2010 of heart arrhythmia while swimming, at the age of 86.

The awards and honors conferred on Nowick over his fifty-year career include an Achievement Award from the American Society for Metals (1963), the A. Frank Golick Lectureship from the University of Missouri (1970) and the Zener Prize (1989). He was also the recipient of the David Turnbull Lectureship, which is bestowed by the Materials Research Society in recognition of career contributions to fundamental understanding of the science of materials.

Offseason
Michael Peca was a major addition to the team for 2006–07, signed from the defending Western Conference champion Edmonton Oilers. However, Peca suffered a broken leg in December after scoring just 4 goals in 35 games.

Goaltender Andrew Raycroft was acquired in a trade from the Boston Bruins to take over the starting job vacancy created by Ed Belfour's departure to the Florida Panthers.

Regular season
On January 4, 2007, the Maple Leafs defeated the Boston Bruins 10–2 away. Alexander Steen scored a hat-trick in the victory. It was the first time that an NHL team had scored ten goals in a regular season game since January 14, 2006, when the Buffalo Sabres defeated the Los Angeles Kings 10–1 at home. It was also the first time that the Maple Leafs had scored ten goals in a regular season game since November 12, 1998, when they defeated the Chicago Blackhawks 10–3 away.

Although they finished in third place in the Northeast Division, the Maple Leafs ultimately failed to qualify for the playoffs after the New York Islanders clinched the eighth and final playoff spot after a 3–2 victory in a shootout to the New Jersey Devils, finishing just one point out of the final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference.

The Maple Leafs tied the Dallas Stars for fewest shorthanded goals scored during the regular season with three.

Toronto's picks at the 2006 NHL Entry Draft in Vancouver, British Columbia.  The Leafs had the 13th overall draft pick in the 2005–06 NHL season. The Maple Leaf's 2006 draft has been referred to in retrospectives as one of the most successful drafts for any team in league history, as all but one of the team's picks (Tyler Ruegsegger) would go on to become NHL regulars at some point in their careers. Leo Komarov, the 180th pick, would be named an NHL All-Star in 2016.

However, despite this the song, along with the other two singles and the album itself, was largely overlooked by critics and the general public.

Critical reception
Larry Flick from Billboard wrote, ""Branigan easily musters the drama required to make this Michael Bolton composition work. In fact, her roof-raising soprano shoulders against the song' parameters, soaring to a satisfying climax. It is little wonder that AC programmers are frothing over this one.

It tells the story of a schoolteacher who falls in love with one of his students, and moves away in order to escape his infatuation. The film is based on the 1947 novel with the same title by Johan Daisne.

The film was awarded the Sutherland Trophy at the 1966 BFI London Film Festival.

Plot
Govert Miereveld, a married man with two children who is working as a teacher in a secondary school, attends the end-of-year awards. Infatuated with Fran Veerman, one of his pupils who in addition to intellect and beauty is a talented singer, he does not manage to declare his love but does ask another girl to give Fran his parting present of a valuable old book. She leaves school and he falls into depression, moving his family to another town and taking a job there as court clerk. Asked to attend the on-site autopsy of a decomposed corpse found in the river, he is profoundly shocked at what happens to the human body.

Afterwards, booking into a hotel, he is amazed to see Fran descending the stairs. She is giving a concert in the town that evening and, when late at night he knocks gently at her door, she lets him in and lets his feelings pour out. Once he has explained how she has been the meaning of his life, she replies that she had loved him too. She goes on to warn him that she is no goddess but had already had an affair before joining his class and has had many men since. Then she shows him her three treasures: a gift from her first lover, the book Govert gave her, and the pistol with which she killed her abusive father (who, Govert realises, was probably the corpse in the river). She begs Govert, if he truly loves her, to end her unhappy life and he fires the pistol.

Later, in a psychiatric institution, he learns by accident that Fran was not killed by his shot. He finally realises that he must abandon his obsession with her and must devote himself to his faithful wife and children.

It last played in the Russian Premier League, having won promotion to the top division of Russian football in 2019, before dissolving in 2021.

History
FC Tambov started out on the professional level in the third-tier Russian Professional Football League in the 2013–14 season. Despite coming in last in their zone in their first professional season, the team was not relegated, as a team that came ahead of them in the table dropped out for financial reasons.

For the 2016–17 season, they were promoted to the Russian Football National League for the first time. On the last day of the 2016–17 season, they needed to defeat FC SKA-Khabarovsk away to achieve 4th place and a spot in the promotion play-offs for the Russian Premier League, but the game ended with a score of 2–2, leaving Tambov in 5th place. At the end of the next 2017–18 season they secured 4th place and a chance to play in the promotion play-offs. They lost both legs of the play-offs to FC Amkar Perm and remained in the FNL.

On 11 May 2019, the club secured a top-two finish in the 2018–19 Russian National Football League and subsequently promotion to the Russian Premier League for the 2019–20 season, for the first time in the club's history. For Premier League football purposes, they played their ""home"" games at the Mordovia Arena in Saransk, 184 miles away. The local ground did not pass the Premier League standards and the planned renovation was not finished by the deadline.

During the winter break of the 2020–21 season, Tambov experienced extreme financial difficulties, which led to most of the squad leaving as free agents, with only 3 players remaining from the autumn part of the season. Russian Premier League advanced the season fees for the TV rights to the club so that it would be able to finish the season and not drop out. The squad was filled out with free agents and prospects which the other RPL teams loaned for the rest of the season. On 27 March 2021, it was reported that Tambov did not apply for the Russian Premier League or Russian Football National League license for the 2021–22 season, but can still apply for the third-tier PFL license. On 2 May 2021, they lost their 9th game in a row (which was also their 17th winless game in a row) and officially secured the last place in the RPL and relegation. They finished the season with a streak of 11 losses and 19 winless matches. On 19 May 2021, club's general director Olga Konovalova announced that all the contracts for coaching and backroom staff and all the players have been terminated and the club will undergo bankruptcy and be dissolved.

""']","Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, 315 U.S. 568 (1942), was a landmark decision of the US Supreme Court in which the Court articulated the fighting words doctrine, a limitation of the First Amendment's guarantee of freedom of speech.

Background 
On April 6, 1940, Walter Chaplinsky, a Jehovah's Witness, was using the public sidewalk as a pulpit in downtown Rochester, passing out pamphlets and calling organized religion a ""racket"". After a large crowd had begun blocking the roads and generally causing a scene, a police officer removed Chaplinsky to take him to police headquarters. Upon seeing the town marshal (who had returned to the scene after warning Chaplinsky earlier to keep it down and avoid causing a commotion), Chaplinsky attacked the marshal verbally. He was then arrested. The complaint against Chaplinsky stated that he shouted: ""You are a God-damned racketeer"" and ""a damned Fascist"". Chaplinsky admitted that he said the words charged in the complaint, with the exception of ""God"".

For this, he was charged and convicted under a New Hampshire statute forbidding intentionally offensive speech directed at others in a public place. Under New Hampshire's Offensive Conduct law (chap. 378, para. 2 of the NH. Public Laws) it is illegal for anyone to address ""any offensive, derisive or annoying word to anyone who is lawfully in any street or public place ... or to call him by an offensive or derisive name.""

Chaplinsky appealed the fine he was assessed, claiming that the law was ""vague"" and that it infringed upon his First Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment rights to free speech.

Alternate views 
Some modern legal historians have disputed the generally accepted version of events that led to Chaplinsky's arrest.

Columbia Law School professor Vincent Blasi's article on the topic describes the events thus: while preaching, Chaplinsky was surrounded by men who mocked Jehovah's Witnesses' objections to saluting the flag. One man attempted to hit Chaplinsky in full view of the town marshal, who warned Chaplinsky that he was in danger but did not arrest his assailant. After the marshal left, another man produced a flagpole and attempted to impale Chaplinsky; while Chaplinsky was pinned against a car by the pole, other members of the crowd struck him. A police officer arrived and, rather than dispersing the crowd, took Chaplinsky into custody.

En route to the station, the officer, as well as members of the crowd, insulted Chaplinsky and his religion.  Chaplinsky responded by calling the town marshal, who had returned to assist the officer, a ""damn fascist and a racketeer"" and was arrested for the use of offensive language in public.

Opinion of the Court 
The Court, in a unanimous decision, upheld the arrest. Writing the decision for the Court, Justice Frank Murphy advanced a ""two-tier theory"" of the First Amendment. Certain ""well-defined and narrowly limited"" categories of speech fall outside the bounds of constitutional protection. Thus, ""the lewd and obscene, the profane, the slanderous"", and (in this case) insulting or ""fighting"" words neither contributed to the expression of ideas nor possessed any ""social value"" in the search for truth.

Murphy wrote:
There are certain well-defined and narrowly limited classes of speech,  the prevention and punishment of which have never been thought to raise any constitutional problem. These include the lewd and obscene, the profane, the libelous, and the insulting or ""fighting"" words those which by their very utterance inflict injury or tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace. It has been well observed that such utterances are no essential part of any exposition of ideas, and are of such slight social value as a step to truth that any benefit that may be derived from them is clearly outweighed by the social interest in order and morality.

Subsequent case law 
Subsequent cases, in the Supreme Court, lower federal courts, and state courts have reached diverse conclusions on what constitute fighting words that are outside the protection of the First Amendment. The cases have also varied on what contexts – such as the reaction of hearers (public officials, police officers, ordinary citizens) – make a difference for the limits on protected speech. A particularly provocative example occurred in Cohen v. California (1971) in which an individual was criminally charged for wearing, in a courthouse, a jacket on which was written ""Fuck the Draft"". The Supreme Court held that the Chaplinsky doctrine did not control this case, and overturned the conviction. The Court's opinion, by Justice John Marshall Harlan II, declared, ""For while the particular four-letter word being litigated here is perhaps more distasteful than most others of its genre, it is nevertheless often true that one man's vulgarity is another's lyric.""

A legal scholar, writing in 2003 over 60 years after the Chaplinsky decision, has noted that lower courts ""have reached maddeningly inconsistent results"" on what is and is not protected by the First Amendment in the area of fighting words.

Although they share similarities, contemporary pagan religious movements are diverse, and as a result, they do not share a single set of beliefs, practices, or texts.

Due to its diversity, many criticisms of modern paganism are directed towards specific neopagan groups, and as a result, they are not directed towards all neopagan groups. Criticisms of specific neopagan groups range from criticisms of their belief in gender essentialism to criticisms of their belief in racial supremacy to criticisms of the worldly focuses of pagan organizations.

The analysis of Slavic and, in particular, Russian neopaganism from the standpoint of religious studies and ethno-politics is carried out in the works of the religious scholar   and the historian Victor Schnirelmann.

Criticism of historicity 
Many pagan traditions have been criticized on the basis that they bear little resemblance to the historical practices of which they claim to be revivals.

Gerald Gardner, the founder of Wicca, claimed that it is a continuation of an ancient persecuted Witch cult, a widely discredited notion.

Kemetic Orthodoxy has been criticized for being more based on contemporary revelation than historical continuity. Kemetism as a whole has been criticized over a lack of historical continuity, with most practices having little archaeological support or support from primary sources.

Romuva has been highly praised for maintaining historical continuity by contrast.

Neopagans have been repeatedly criticized for pseudohistorical and pseudolinguistic activities, and promotion of pseudoscience (see for example, The Veles Book).

Certain Russian scholars, such as O. V. Kutarev, believe that ""old paganism in its fullness in Europe is essentially unknown, except the beliefs of Mari and Udmurts"", and ""the restoration of 'pure' paganism as it was in antiquity is impossible"".

Analogous to cafeteria Christianity, some pagans have been criticized as cafeteria pagans for appropriating disparate practices across several traditions out of their original contexts.

According to E. L. Moroz, Slavic neopaganism is a religion ""in which the names of the ancient Slavic gods are combined with a vulgarized presentation of Hinduism and supplemented by all kinds of revelations about black and light energies and cosmic worlds.

According to Vladimir Borisovich Yashin, neopaganism is not so much an attempt to restore the real traditional pagan religions of the past as it is to establish an occult-esoteric worldview.

Russian archaeologist Leo Klejn, who devoted one of his books to the reconstruction of ancient Slavic paganism, negatively assessed the activities of Rodnovers, who (he asserts) are not really interested in ""what their ancient ancestors prayed to and how they got on with their rites, what celebrations they celebrated and what they wore. Their present-day festive and ceremonial actions, devised in the style a la russe, are a show, a spectacle, a buffoonery. And they themselves are skomorokhi.""

The Belarusian publicist, scholar and former figure of the neopagan movement Alexei Dzermant provided a similar assessment of the Rodnovers' activity:Their calendar of holidays and pantheon of gods is usually made up of fragments characteristic not of a particular local tradition, but borrowed from various East and West Slavic, Indian, Scandinavian sources, ""cabinet"" mythology; Folklore texts are usually ignored; forgeries like the ""Veles Book"" are worshipped as ""holy writs""; traditional rites are replaced by invented rituals; ritualistic ""prayers"" are sung instead of ritual songs; and folk music is either completely absent or presented in a ""balalaika"" form, Tasteless stylizations of early medieval and folk attire are understood as ""Slavic"" clothing; signs and symbols are used in a completely unmotivated manner; texts of ""Rodnovers""-ideologists are imbued with profane esotericism, parascience, dubious historical ""discoveries,"" and national megalomania.A different view is presented in the works of the Czech ethnologist, a specialist in the field of Czech ethnography and Rodnovery Jiří Machuda. He acknowledged the reality of reconstructions of Slavic pagan ceremonial complex by Rodnovers. At the same time, he noted that the basis for reconstructing the rites is not historical sources, but folklore and folk worldview.

Victor Schnirelmann distinguished two streams in the world neopaganism: speculative neopaganism, widespread among the urban intelligentsia, who lost all connection with tradition and genuine popular culture, and the revival of folk religion in the village, where we can often trace a continuous line of continuity coming from the past. In his opinion, ""the first certainly prevails among Russians, Ukrainians, Belarusians, Lithuanians, Latvians and Armenians, where one can safely speak of the 'invention of tradition'"". Similarly,  and E. Skachkova distinguished modern paganism as an unbroken tradition, though changing in response to the challenges of our time (with the Mari, Udmurts, Ossetians, etc.), and the new paganism, or neopaganism (with peoples who have historically moved away from the pagan past, including the Slavic neopaganism), a tradition constructed on the basis of the authors' ideas. Historian, religious scholar and ethnologist A. V. Gurko believed that the concept of ""neo-paganism"" ""can be defined from the term 'paganism,' which refers to heterogeneous polytheistic religions, cults, beliefs, and the definition of new religious movements characterized by syncretism, active use of mass media, communications, apocalypticism, missionaryism"". However, according to M. A. Vasiliev, it is incorrect to apply the term ""neo-paganism"" (lit. ""new paganism"") to a movement that has long lost its connection with the traditional culture. In his opinion, it is preferable to call this artificial and eclectic intellectual construct pseudo-paganism, i.e. pseudo-paganism.

Those who oppose the Greek National Religion try to present as arbitrary its identification with the historical ancient Greek religion, arguing that there was no religion in ancient Greece. They argue that what they call ancient Greek religion is a set of beliefs, mythology, ritual practices, ideological, philosophical, scientific and political concepts much more diverse and less rigidly structured than any religion in the modern, Abrahamic sense. This whole developed over a period of more than 1500 years, half of it in eras without a script (which would have acted as a stabilizing factor), changed from period to period and from region to region, and was subjected to foreign influences. The diversity and lack of coherence, according to them, is largely due to the fact that in Ancient Greece there was never a supreme religious authority imposing an ""orthodox"" version, nor were there Holy Scriptures with universal acceptance, such as the Old Testament, the New Testament, the Quran, or others.

Criticism of pagan communities and hierarchies 
The decentralized nature of many pagan communities has led many to demonstrate traits very different from traditional organized religions. Some scholars have argued that the lack of religious hierarchies leads to an increase in political extremism on both the right and left, or that it leads to members feeling lost and unable to find spiritual guidance.

Many pagans have expressed little interest or even opposition to the development of more robust organizational structures. Many express their paganism as a manifestation of a rejection of organized religion. This is especially true among more progressive pagan groups.

This is not a universal ideal, with many pagans citing a disillusionment with Christian theology but a desire for Christian-like organizational structure. This issue continues to be subject to much debate and self-criticism in pagan circles.

Rodnovery and Kemetic Orthodoxy have been relatively free of this criticism due to their more robust organizational structures.

Racial issues

Slavic

Some forms of modern Slavic paganism have been assessed by researchers as extremist radical-nationalist.

Victor Schnirelmann considered Russian neopaganism as a branch of Russian nationalism that denies Russian Orthodoxy (Christianity) as an enduring national value, and identified two cardinal tasks that Russian neopaganism set itself: saving Russian national culture from the levelling influence of modernization and protecting the natural environment from the impact of modern civilization. Anti-Christian, nationalistic, antisemitic, and racist attitudes of neopagan groups were noted. This aspect of Rodnovery in Russia has been reflected in a number of court decisions: some Rodnovery organizations and writings were included in the Russian Ministry of Justice List of Extremist Organizations and the Federal List of Extremist Materials, respectively. According to Shnirelman, ""Russian neo-paganism is a radical kind of conservative ideology, characterized by outright anti-intellectualism and populism"".

 attributes the origins of Slavic neopaganism to the beginning of the twentieth century. According to , the psychological motivation for participation in Rodnovery organizations can be linked to a compensatory function: people often come here who, for various reasons, have not been able to fulfill themselves in other spheres of life.

 considers it a mistake to reduce the entire diversity of Rodnovery groups only to nationalism, and that the ecological direction of Rodnovery is no less significant. In the conclusion of his dissertation  wrote:An adequate approach to Slavic neo-paganism can ensure the transition of the bulk of its participants to natural-ecological types of groups, thereby defusing national tensions and freeing up greater forces for potential creation under a new identity.

According to , Rodnovery is only an attempt to comprehend and recreate historical culture and tradition, which were largely lost by the urban population in the 20th century.

Germanic

Germanic occultism and neopaganism emerged in the early 20th Century and it became influential, with beliefs such as Ariosophy, gaining adherents inside the far-right Völkisch movement which eventually culminated in Nazism. Post-World War II continuations of similar beliefs have given rise to the Wotansvolk, a white nationalist neopagan movement, in the late 20th Century.

Modern white supremacist and neo-Nazi ideologies, with all of their racist, antisemitic, and anti-LGBTQ beliefs, have either continued to practice, infiltrated, or co-opted many Germanic and Norse Heathen traditions, such as Ásatrú (sometimes called Odinism). These groups believe that the Norse-Germanic beliefs which they adhere to form the true Caucasian-European ethnic religion.

The question of race represents a major source of division among Heathens, particularly in the United States. Within the Heathen community, one viewpoint is that race is entirely a matter of biological heredity, while the opposing position is that race is a social construct which is rooted in cultural heritage. In U.S. Heathen discourse, these viewpoints are described as the folkish and the universalist positions, respectively. These two factions—which Kaplan termed the ""racialist"" and ""nonracialist"" camps—often clash, with Kaplan claiming that a ""virtual civil war"" existed between them within the American Heathen community. The universalist and folkish divisions have also spread to other countries, although has had less impact in the more ethnically homogenous Iceland. A 2015 survey revealed a greater number of Heathens subscribed to universalist ideas than folkish ones.

Contrasting with this binary division, Gardell divides Heathenry in the United States into three groups according to their stances on race: the ""anti-racist"" group which denounces any association between the religion and racial identity, the ""radical racist"" faction which believes that the religion should not be followed by members of other racial groups because racial identity is the natural religion of the Aryan race, and the ""ethnic"" faction which seeks to carve out a middle-path by acknowledging the religion's roots in Northern Europe and its connection to people who are of Northern European heritage. The religious studies scholar Stefanie von Schnurbein adopted Gardell's tripartite division, although referred to the groups as the ""a-racist"", ""racial-religious"", and ""ethnicist"" factions respectively.

Exponents of the universalist and anti-racist approach believe that the deities of Germanic Europe can call anyone to worship them, regardless of ethnic background. This group rejects the folkish emphasis on race, believing that even if it is unintended, it can lead to the adoption of racist attitudes towards people who are of non-Northern European ancestry. Universalist practitioners such as Stephan Grundy have emphasized the fact that ancient Northern Europeans were known to marry and have children with members of other ethnic groups, and he has also stated that in Norse mythology, the Æsir also did the same thing with Vanir, Jötunn, and humans, thus, he has used such points to criticize the racialist view.  Universalists welcome practitioners of Heathenry who are not of Northern European ancestry; for instance, there are Jewish and African American members of the U.S.-based Troth, and many of its white members have spouses who are members of different racial groups. While some Heathens continue to believe that Heathenry is an indigenous religion, proponents of this view have sometimes argued that Heathenry is indigenous to the land of Northern Europe, rather than indigenous to any specific race. Universalist Heathens often express frustration that some journalists depict Heathenry as an intrinsically racist movement, and they use their online presence to stress their opposition to far-right politics.

Folkish practitioners consider Heathenry the indigenous religion of a biologically distinct race, which is conceptualised as being ""white"", ""Nordic"", or ""Aryan"". Some practitioners explain this by asserting that the religion is intrinsically connected to this race's collective unconscious,  with prominent American Heathen Stephen McNallen developing this belief into a concept which he termed ""metagenetics"". McNallen and many others in the ""ethnic"" faction of Heathenry explicitly state that they are not racists, although Gardell noted that their views would be deemed racist under certain definitions of the word. Gardell considered many ""ethnic"" Heathens ethnic nationalists, and many folkish practitioners express disapproval of multiculturalism and the mixture of different races in modern Europe, advocating racial separatism. This group's discourse contains much talk of ""ancestors"" and ""homelands"", concepts that may be very vaguely defined. Ethno-centrist Heathens are heavily critical of their universalist counterparts, they frequently declare that the latter have been misled by New Age literature and political correctness. Those who have adopted the ""ethnic"" folkish position have been criticized by members of the universalist and ethno-centrist factions, the former deeming ""ethnic"" Heathenry a front for racism and the latter deeming its adherents race traitors for their failure to fully embrace white supremacism.

Some folkish Heathens are white supremacists and explicit racists, representing a ""radical racist"" faction that favours the terms Odinism, Wotanism, and Wodenism.  These individuals inhabit ""the most distant reaches"" of modern paganism, according to Kaplan. The borders between this form of Heathenry and National Socialism (Nazism) are ""exceedingly thin"", because its adherents pay tribute to Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany, claim that the white race is facing extinction at the hands of a Jewish world conspiracy, and reject Christianity as a creation of the Jews. Many individuals who were in the inner circle of The Order, a white supremacist militia which was active in the U.S. during the 1980s, called themselves Odinists, and various racist Heathens have espoused the Fourteen Words slogan which was developed by the Order member David Lane. Some white supremacist organisations, such as the Order of Nine Angles and the Black Order, combine elements of Heathenism with elements of Satanism, although other racist Heathens, such as Wotansvolk's Ron McVan, reject the syncretism of these two religions.

Lack of spirituality 

Many involved in the New Age have expressed criticism of paganism for emphasizing the material world over the spiritual.

Modern pagans frequently seek to distance themselves from New Age identity and some communities use the term ""New Age"" as an insult. Their recurring criticism of New Age ethos and practice includes accusations of charging too much money, of thinking in simplistic ways and of engaging in escapism. They reject the common New Age metaphor of a battle between the forces of light and darkness, arguing that darkness represents a necessary part of the natural world which should not be viewed as evil.

New Agers criticise modern pagans for placing too much emphasis on the material world and for lacking a proper spiritual perspective. There has been New Age criticism of how some modern pagans embrace extravagant subcultures, such as adopting dark colour schemes and imagery. People from both movements have accused the other of egocentrism and narcissism.

LGBT issues

Gender dualism, essentialism, and sexual orientation 

Ideological issues that affect LGBTQ perception and interaction within the modern pagan community often stem from a traditionally dualistic cosmology, a view which focuses on two overarching and often oppositional categories. In modern paganism, this is traditionally seen surrounding sexuality, particularly heterosexuality, based on a gender binary which is assigned via genitalia at birth (in other words, gender essentialism.).

Binary gender essentialism is highly present in neopagan communities and their respective theological/philosophical belief systems. Pagan sources themselves, such as the Pagan Federation of the U.K., express views concurring with this academic understanding. The basis of the difference is commonly reflected in discussion about spiritual energy, which is traditionally believed to be intrinsically masculine or feminine in type and inherently possessed by those born into either binary gender.

A preeminent example of this belief is the duotheistic veneration of a God-Goddess pairing, often the Triple Goddess and Horned God, a pairing used by Wiccans. The Goddess (representing the feminine) is traditionally seen as receptive, fertile, nurturing, and passive (cast as the Moon), while the God (representing the masculine) as impregnative, a hunter, and active/aggressive (cast as the Sun). Janet Farrar, a notable Wiccan priestess and author, described this as an adoption of yin and yang in Western pagan practice.

This dual-gender archetype is traditionally regarded in a heterosexual manner, a belief which is reflected in the theology of many neopagan belief systemsas well as practices such as magic and spellcraft, which traditional sects require heterosexual-based dynamics to perform. This can be a struggle for LGBTQ pagans who find the exemplified duality not reflective of their own feelings and desires.

The liturgy of the deity pair is often associated in essentialist ways. The Triple Goddess is associated with the reproductive development and cessation of cisgender woman in her three aspects Maiden, Mother, and Crone. Beginning life, the Maiden (young woman) represents virginal preadolescence. Upon menarche, the woman comes of age and transforms into the Mother (adult woman) aspect, now ostensibly capable of reproduction. Upon menopause, the woman loses her reproductive capacity she once carried, transforming into the Crone (mature woman) aspect. The Moon is believed to represent the menstrual cycle and many pagans believe the two are linked. Likewise, The Horned God is associated with the reproductive capability of cisgender men. Phallic symbology, such as the eponymous horns, represent the penis and the associated reproductive function.

In his 1997 manifesto Vargsmål, the Norwegian metal musician and the racial pagan Varg Vikernes, claimed that homosexuality is a type of ""spiritual defect"" that results from men who are ""develop[ing] womanly instincts"" and women ""who think they are men"", and they also claimed that female bisexuality is ""natural"" provided it does not reject attraction to men. In 2005, Vikernes claimed on his personal website that ""you cannot be Pagan and homosexual or even tolerate homosexuality.""

Recent historical views on sexuality and gender 
In the mid-20th century dawn of neopaganism, heterosexual dualism was most exemplified in the ""Great Rite"" of British Traditional Wicca, one of the first notable neopagan ideological groups. In this Rite, a priest and priestess ""were cast into rigidly gendered, heteronormative roles"" in which the pairing performed a symbolic or literal representation of heterosexual intercourse which was considered vital for venerating supernatural entities and performing magic. It is notable that early neopagan views on sex were radical for their time in their sex positivity and tacit acceptance of BDSM.

Later in the 20th Century, as Wicca spread to North America, it incorporated countercultural, second-wave feminist, and LGBTQ elements. The essentialist rigidity fluctuated under the influence of Carl Jung's notions of anima and animus and non-heterosexual orientations became more acceptable. By the 1980s and 1990s, figures like Vivianne Crowley and Starhawk continued the evolving beliefs. Crowley associated the Jungian binary with classical elements possessed by all—the feminine/anima with water and the masculine/animus with fire. Starhawk, espousing views similar to Crowley in her 1979 edition of her seminal book The Spiral Dance, began calling into question the masculine-feminine divisions entirely by the 1999 edition, and instead focusing on traits instead of gender archetypes.

At the dawn of the 21st century, queer neopagans and their sects began to assert themselves more publicly. These LGBTQ-aligned groups ""challenged the gender essentialism remaining in the sexual polarity still practiced"" which remained in certain Wicca and feminist neopagan enclaves. Greater exploration and acceptance of queer and transgender figures began not only for adherents but deities and mythological figures as well. In addition, sex positivity and BDSM were brought back into active exploration and acceptance.

Gardnerian Wicca 

Gerald Gardner, the eponymous founder of Gardnerian Wicca, particularly stressed heterosexual approaches to Wicca. This practice may stem from Gardner's text (ostensibly quoting a witch, but perhaps in his own words):

Gardner was accused of homophobia by Lois Bourne, one of the high priestesses of the Bricket Wood coven:Gerald was homophobic. He had a deep hatred and detestation of homosexuality, which he regarded as a disgusting perversion and a flagrant transgression of natural law... ""There are no homosexual witches, and it is not possible to be a homosexual and a witch"" Gerald almost shouted. No one argued with him.However, the legitimacy of Gardner's rumored homophobia is disputable because Gardner showed much more evidence of an open and accepting attitude about practices in his writing which would not be characterized by the hatred or phobia which was common in the 1950s:Also, though the witch ideal is to form perfect couples of people ideally suited to each other, nowadays this is not always possible; the right couples go together and the rest go singly and do as they can. Witchcraft today is largely a case of ""make do"".

Criticism from Abrahamic religions 

In the Islamic World, pagans are not considered people of the book, so they are not protected under Islamic religious law.

Regarding European paganism, in Modern Paganism in World Cultures: Comparative Perspectives Michael F. Strmiska writes that ""in Pagan magazines, websites, and Internet discussion venues, Christianity is frequently denounced as an antinatural, antifemale, sexually and culturally repressive, guilt-ridden, and authoritarian religion that has fostered intolerance, hypocrisy, and persecution throughout the world."" Furthermore, in the pagan community, the belief that Christianity and paganism are opposing belief systems is common. This animosity is inflamed by historical conflicts between Christian and pre-Christian religions, as well as the perceived ongoing disdain for paganism among Christians. Some pagans have claimed that Christian authorities have never apologized for the religious displacement of Europe's pre-Christian belief systems, particularly following the Roman Catholic Church's apology for past antisemitism in its A Reflection on the Shoah. They also express disapproval of Christianity's continued missionary efforts around the globe at the expense of indigenous and other polytheistic faiths.

Some Christian authors have published books which criticize modern paganism,  while other Christian critics have equated paganism with Satanism, which it was often portrayed as such in the mainstream American entertainment industry in the 2000s.

In areas such as the US Bible Belt, where conservative Christian dominance is strong, pagans still experience religious persecution. For instance, Strmiska highlighted instances in both the US and the UK in which school teachers were fired when their employers discovered that they were pagans. Thus, many pagans keep their religion private in order to avoid discrimination and ostracism.

Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia Alexy II at the opening of the Archbishops Council in 2004 called the spread of neopaganism one of the main threats of the 21st century, placing it on a par with terrorism and ""other pernicious phenomena of our time"". In this regard, Circle of Pagan Tradition sent an open letter to the Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church, which was forwarded on 18 October 2004, to the Department for External Church Relations Moscow Patriarchate. This open letter stated that statements that offend the honor and dignity of modern pagans and violate the laws ""On Freedom of Conscience and on Religious Associations"" and ""On Counteracting Extremist Activity"" were inadmissible.

In publications which were written by leaders of the Russian Orthodox Church, the unscientific approach to the reconstruction of ancient Slavic beliefs by adherents of Rodnovery is extensively documented.

At the opening of the XVIII World Russian People's Council in 2014, Patriarch Kirill of Moscow and All Russia noted that on the road to preserving national memory, ""unfortunately, quite painful and dangerous phenomena arise. These include attempts to construct pseudo-Russian pagan beliefs. On the one hand, this is an extremely low estimate of the religious choice of the Russian people who have lived for a thousand years in the bosom of the Orthodox Church, as well as of the historical path taken by Orthodox Russia. On the other hand, it is the conviction of one's own personal and narrow-group superiority over one's own people. He saw the roots of this social phenomenon in the ""tendency to ignore the importance of the Russian people"" and the ""revision of Russian history"" in the 1990s, as a result of which many compatriots have shaken ""faith in their people and in their country."" ""How torn must the national consciousness have been, in what caves of thought and spirit must it have been, for someone, considering himself the bearer of the Russian national idea, to abandon the saints and heroes of their native history, the deeds of their ancestors, and make Nazis and their henchmen their idols? "".

Philosophical criticism 
Beliefs and practices vary widely among pagan groups; however, there are a series of core principles common to most, if not all, forms of modern paganism. The English academic Graham Harvey noted that pagans ""rarely indulge in theology"".

Neopagan theology has been criticized for its lack of coherence. Proponents often argue that this incoherence is not an issue with the religion as it is more based on Orthopraxy than Orthodoxy. Criticisms have also been made on the lack of Orthopraxy as many rituals have very little standardization across different communities.

Criticism from Russian Scholars 

Historian Vladimir Borisovich Yashin identifies the following main features of this phenomenon:- The ancient conceptions of the world, the guardians of which the adherents of neo-paganism proclaim themselves to be, are interpreted by them as a strictly structured system of higher knowledge, surpassing both religious dogmatism and the materialistic limitations of modern science, but at the same time harmoniously synthesizing elements of faith and scientific thinking (which in reality usually turns out to be outright irrationalism and eclecticism).

- Neo-pagan texts and doctrines are distinguished, on the one hand, by their scientific imagery, wide use of notions, ideas and achievements of modern science and technology, and pseudo-rational interpretation of folklore plots and mythologemes. On the other hand, it is argued that mastering the wisdom of the ancestors offers the adherent a superhuman perspective, transforming his nature and transforming him into a human god, and therefore neopaganism is imbued with the spirit of mysticism and magic.

- Accordingly, neo-pagan knowledge is presented by neo-pagans as secret knowledge, oriented toward the chosen, the initiated. They emphasize the direct continuity of neopagan communities (emerging before our eyes) with some deeply concealed, rigidly organized unions of ancient wise men, which did not disappear with Christianization.

- In addition to the symbols and images of the national tradition, the neo-pagans actively use fragments of classical occult-esoteric systems such as Gnosticism, Kabbalah, Theosophy, etc.

- No less actively the neo-pagan revelations include images and motifs of the fantasy genre and the whole gentlemanly set of modern technocratic myth-making (paleocontact, space aliens, flying saucers, etc.).

- Neopagan ideology is internally antinomian: on the one hand, neopaganism tends towards nationalism, the cult of exceptional greatness of its people, while at the same time it asserts the universality of ancient super knowledge and postulates the existence of a certain original ""secret doctrine"" that forms the basis of all known spiritual teachings. In this connection neo-paganism freely introduces fragments of the most diverse ""alien"" traditions into its constructions.

- At the same time, neo-paganism openly opposes the historic world religions, although at the same time it adopts much of their dogma, cult practices, etc.

- Neo-paganism represents the most politicized wing of the ""new religious movements,"" and even initially apolitical associations of supporters of the revival of the ""glorious past"" eventually become used by certain political forces.

Violent incidents of Rodnovery 
Some Rodnovery organizations have been declared extremist by Russian courts. Rodnovery followers have committed a number of hate crimes, including armed attacks and terrorist acts mainly against members of Orthodox churches and representatives of non-Slavic nationalities.

 In 2003, the office of the Memorial NGO was attacked by armed men in Saint Petersburg. Two unknown masked persons threatened the employees of the organization with a hammer, tied them up, threw them into a closet, and removed their office equipment worth 125,000 rubles. The prosecutor's office opened a criminal case under article 162 Criminal Code of Russia ""Robbery"". The chief priest of the association ""Skhoron zhizhen"" Vladimir Golyakov was detained on this case. In 2004, Golyakov was sentenced to five years of suspended imprisonment for robbery.
 In 2006, Alexandr Koptsev broke into the synagogue on Bolshaya Bronnaya (Moscow) with a knife and wounded Rabbi Yitzhak Kogan and nine congregants. He was detained at the scene by a security guard and worshippers at the synagogue. During the investigation of the case, it was found that Koptsev's desk book was an essay titled ""The Blow of the Russian Gods"".
 In 2007, a student at a Penza university broke a memorial plaque into pieces with several blows with an axe and damaged a wooden cross at the site of the future construction of the St. Elisabethan spiritual and pastoral center, and resisted law enforcement officers when he tried to arrest them and burned one of them with liquid from a gas canister in the eyes. During the trial, the defendant stated that he committed his unlawful act under the impression of the book ""Blow of the Russian Gods"".
 In 2008, in Yekaterinburg, a swastika and the inscription: ""Russian or Christian. Choose one."" The next day the young man threw one Molotov cocktail at the church and another at the parish school, and fled the scene. The wooden church burned down completely.
 In 2008, Rodnovers David Bashelutskov, Stanislav Lukhmyrin, and Yevgenia Zhihareva made a bomb, placing it in a three-liter can with a fuse in the form of a firecracker, and brought it to the Church of Nicholas the Wonderworker in Biryulyovo. Anna Mikhalkina, a 62-year-old priestess of the church, found the smoking bomb and poured water on it, as a result of which only the fuse detonated. Nevertheless, Mikhalkina and parishioner Pavel Bukovsky, who carried the bomb out of the church, were seriously injured: Mikhalkina sustained eye injuries, burns and shrapnel wounds and lost one eye, while Bukovsky suffered a head contusion and a leg wound. The Rodnovers left the bomb in the temple during the evening service when the building was full of people. Experts noted that the amount of explosives would have been enough to completely destroy the wooden building of the church. The attackers were counting on a large number of casualties. Rodnovery members formed an ""autonomous fighting group,"" and before the attack on the church killed more than a dozen people of ""non-Slavic"" appearance, including a 60-year-old Azerbaijani, and also in 2008 killed a Russian man near the church of Nicholas the Wonderworker in Biryulyovo, mistaking him for an Orthodox priest. Rodnovers considered the mosque on Poklonnaya Hill to be their next target
 In 2009, a wooden church of blessed Kozma Verkhotursky was burned down in Yekaterinburg using a ""Molotov cocktail. The arsonists left an inscription on the fence of the temple: ""The Warrior of the Rod. Svyatoslav's Men."".
 In 2009 in Vladimir Sergey Khlupin left a letter on the fence of St. Cyril and Methodius Church, threatening to blow up the church if it continued to function. He then committed an act of terror by throwing a homemade bomb through the window. The explosion damaged church utensils, but no one was hurt. The explosion was a warning, with a leaflet that read, ""By terror and the destruction of Judeo-Christian shrines, we will put an end to the spread of this contagion."" Khlupin intended to kill people if his ultimatum was not carried out, but was detained. During a search he was found to have an arsenal of weapons.
 In 2014, Stepan Komarov, a security company officer and follower of the teachings of Nikolai Levashov, opened fire on parishioners of the Resurrection Cathedral in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, wounding six people and killing two - nun Lyudmila (Pryashnikova) and parishioner Vladimir Zaporozhets, who was asking for alms on the porch, who entered the church and tried to stop the criminal.

Rodnovers are also attacked by their ideological opponents, mostly Orthodox, and less frequently by other nationalists. Rodnovers' places of worship are often destroyed, and the police often fail to act.
 In the village of Okunevo of Omsk Oblast, Rodnovers erected a pillar topped with a swastika, which caused concern among local Orthodox priests. In 1993, a church delegation headed by Archbishop Theodosius arrived in Okunevo. Representatives of the delegation replaced a shivaist pillar with a Om sign with a massive Orthodox cross. Later a chapel was built nearby.
 A series of scandals involving the Orthodox community, city authorities, and youth anti-fascist organizations took place in St. Petersburg around the ""All-Slavic"" sanctuary of Perun there, created under the leadership of Vladimir Golyakov, the high priest of the ""Schoron zhozhen"" association. In 2007, the shrine was destroyed.
 In 2009, the supreme sorcerer of the Ukrainian association ""Rodnoi Fires of the Native Orthodox Faith"" Vladimir Kurovsky at the head of his ""Polk of Perun"" discovered the idol of Perun on Mount Bogit (Ternopil region, not far from the location of the Zbrush Idol). A few days later, the idol was torn down by fighters of Tryzub led by Greek Catholic priests. Several priests were beaten.
 In 2012, four participants were shot and stabbed at a Kupala festival held by Rodnovers in Bitsa Park (Moscow). Vladimir Golyakov, who was present there, was slightly injured. Golyakov blamed the incident on a ""foreign yoke"" and wrote that it was no accident that it happened during Vladimir Putin's visit to Israel. Lubomir (Dionis Georgis), head of the Commonwealth of Natural Faith ""Slavia"" wrote that a number of Rodnovers hold the Russian Orthodox Church and the state bodies supporting it responsible for the attack.
 On 17 October 2017, it became known that in the village of Pochinki Nizhny Novgorod Oblast unknown vandals were destroying a neopagan temple. Unknown persons knocked down two idols and ripped animal skulls from trees.
 In 2015, Vladimir Golyakov installed a neopagan idol near an Orthodox church in Kupchina, which was then fallen by unknown persons and then sawed to pieces by the Orthodox political figure Vitaly Milonov. Golyakov set up the pole again.

Historian and religious scholar R. V. Shizhensky believes that Rodnovery is not dangerous and that radical groups should be dealt with by law enforcement agencies.

The Red Ribbon Project of the Traditional Religions Foundation monitors persecution, harassment of Rodnovers, and conflicts. It publishes an annual report on the number of sanctuaries destroyed, negative statements, etc.

The conflict in eastern Ukraine has caused different reactions among Ukrainian Rodnovers. Representatives of the Native Ukrainian National Faith view Russia as the aggressor, while members of other Rodnovery organizations, such as the Pan-Slavic Rodnovery Fire of the Native Orthodox Faith, most often believe that Russians and Ukrainians are brothers and that the conflict is caused by machinations of the United States.

Rodnovers played an important role in the War in Donbas by forming armed units or joining active units. Some, such as the Svarog battalion, fought on the side of the rebels; others, such as the Azov detachment, fought on the side of Ukraine.

The Svarog battalion, an all Rodnover military unit fought in the Donetsk people's republic until its leader was imprisoned by the republic, they had many unique practices such as vegetarianism.

Pro-Russian Slavic military units in Donbass are represented by such formations as the Svarog battalion, ""Varyag"", The ""Rusich"" sabotage and assault reconnaissance group (SSRG) in Luhansk People's Republic, the ""Ratibor"" SSRG also under the ""Batman"" SSRG, and Rodnovers in the Russian Orthodox Army. Rodnovers are engaged in missionary work in the region and promote the concept of a new Russian world. Pro-Russian Rodnovers often use the eight-branched swastika as a military symbol.

The commander of DSRG Rusich was Alexei Milchakov, a well-known neo-Nazi from St. Petersburg who had repeatedly killed and eaten dogs and called out on social media: ""Cut up homeless people, puppies, and children!.  According to him, Rusich consists of ""nationalist Rodnovers ... volunteers from Russia and Europe"" and acts as a ""closed collective"" and is a unit in which Russian nationalists receive combat training. On the chevrons of ""Rusich"" fighters there is an eight-pointed ""swastika. The emblem of the DSRG ""Ratibor"" has a swastika and a skull on it. In the Petrovsky district of Donetsk, the Rodnovery community ""Kolo Derevo Roda"" led by Oleg Orchikov (Volkhov Vargan) organized the ""Svarga"" people's militia in late February 2014, which grew during the war into the numerous ""Svarog battalion, the fourth battalion of the ""Oplot"" association. Oleg Orchikov (call sign ""Vargan"") became the battalion commander. He constantly wore an armband of a priest with a swastika pattern and called for creation of ""one state from the Pacific Ocean to the Atlantic Ocean"". Battalion fighters performed prayers in camouflage and with submachine guns at idols, propagated the idea of ""the superiority of the Slavic race"" and claimed that their opponents ""have not yet reached human level. On 28 October 2014, drunken members of the Svarog battalion beat each other and civilians and opened fire in Donetsk, after which Orchikov was arrested in November and the battalion disbanded. In November 2014, the top of the battalion, led by Orchikov, was sent to prison. Other battalion fighters were integrated into the DNR army. Soon, the Russian volunteer Rodnovers, who had fought in the Luhansk People's Republic as part of the Ghost Battalion and the Batman rapid reaction group, were sent back to their homeland.

The previously taboo topics of race and racism in the Arab world have been explored more since the rise of foreign, private and independent media. In one example, Al-Jazeera's critical coverage of the Darfur crisis led to the arrest and conviction of its Khartoum bureau chief.

History

Medieval Arab attitudes to Black people varied over time and individual attitude, but tended to be negative. Though the Qur'an expresses no racial prejudice, ethnocentric prejudice towards black people is widely evident among medieval Arabs, for a variety of reasons: their extensive conquests and slave trade; the influence of Aristotelian ideas regarding slavery, which some Muslim philosophers directed towards Zanj and the influence of Judeo-Christian ideas regarding divisions among humankind. On the other hand, the Afro-Arab author Al-Jahiz, himself having a Zanj grandfather, wrote a book entitled Superiority of the Blacks to the Whites, and explained why the Zanj were black in terms of environmental determinism in the ""On the Zanj"" chapter of The Essays. By the 14th century, a significant number of slaves came from either West or Central Africa; Lewis argues that this led to the likes of Egyptian historian Al-Abshibi (1388–1446) writing that ""[i]t is said that when the [black] slave is sated, he fornicates, when he is hungry, he steals.""

Racist attitudes
The Guardian’s journalist, Brian Whitaker, wrote on the race taboo in the Arab World; an excerpt: Racism is a worldwide phenomenon. In some countries it's met with disapproval, in others with denial. The A to Z of ethnic and religious groups in the Middle East embraces Alawites, Armenians, Assyrians, Baháʼís, Berbers, Copts, Druzes, Ibadis, Ismailis, Jews, Kurds, Maronites, Sahrawis, Tuareq, Turkmens, Yazidis and Zaidis and Nubians (by no means an exhaustive list), and yet serious discussion of ethnic/religious diversity and its place in society is a long-standing taboo.
If the existence of non-Arab or non-Muslim groups is acknowledged at all, it is usually only to declare how wonderfully everyone gets along.

Mona Eltahawy, a columnist for Egypt's Al Masry Al Youm and Qatar's Al Arab, wrote in the New York Times an article titled, ""Racism: The Arab world's dirty secret"". She was a witness to racist attacks by Arab Egyptians on blacks and stated: ""We are a racist people in Egypt and we are in deep denial about it. On my Facebook page, I blamed racism for my argument and an Egyptian man wrote to deny that we are racists and used as his proof a program on Egyptian Radio featuring Sudanese songs and poetry! Our silence over racism not only destroys the warmth and hospitality we are proud of as Egyptians, it has deadly consequences."" She believed racism was behind a police crackdown on 5,000 Sudanese refugees and the beating to death of some women and children. She added: ""The racism I saw on the Cairo Metro has an echo in the Arab world at large, where the suffering in Darfur goes ignored because its victims are black and because those who are creating the misery in Darfur are not Americans or Israelis and we only pay attention when America and Israel behave badly."" She criticized the country's attitudes: ""We love to cry 'Islamophobia' when we talk about the way Muslim minorities are treated in the West and yet we never stop to consider how we treat minorities and the most vulnerable among us."" While noting that racist incidents are condemned in the United States, she said that in Egypt, as well as in the Arab world, there is a culture of silence toward racist incidents which reflects negatively on Arab society.

Accusations against specific Arab governments

Iraq

According to a statement by Fred Halliday, the Ba'athists in Iraq were inspired by Sati' al-Husri and with rhetoric tinged with pan-Arabism and anti-Iranian sentiment. In the decade and a half after the Ba'ath party came to power, up to 200,000 Feyli Kurds were expelled from Iraq. In claiming to be  ""defenders of Arabism"", Halliday asserts the Ba'ath promoted a myth of Persian migrants and communities in the Persian Gulf region to be comparable to ""Zionists"" settling Palestine.

Mauritania
According to Holly Burkhalter of Human Rights Watch, in a statement made in testimony before the Congress of the United States, ""It is fair to say that the Mauritanian government practices undeclared apartheid and severely discriminates on the basis of race.""

Sudan
Beginning in 1991, elders of the Zaghawa people of Sudan complained that they were victims of an intensifying Arab apartheid campaign. Vukoni Lupa Lasaga has accused the Sudanese government of ""deftly manipulat(ing) Arab solidarity"" to carry out policies of apartheid and ethnic cleansing against non-Arabs in Darfur. Alan Dershowitz has pointed to Sudan as an example of a government that deserves the appellation ""apartheid"", and former Canadian Minister of Justice Irwin Cotler has also criticized Sudan in similar terms.

Egypt
Dark-skinned Egyptian President Anwar Sadat faced insults of not looking ""Egyptian enough"" and ""Nasser's black poodle"". An Egyptian Nubian soccer player Mahmoud Abdel Razek stopped playing football due to racist slurs by rival Egyptian fans during a game.

According to the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR), Black African immigrants to Egypt often face physical violence and verbal abuse at the hands of the general public and law enforcement officials. Refugees from Sudan are especially targeted, with racial slurs like ""oonga boonga"" and ""samara"" (meaning ""black"") constituting the most typical insults. The EIPR attributes the violence and abuse to both a lack of government efforts at disseminating information, raising awareness and dispelling myths with regard to the economic contributions made by the newcomers, and stereotyping on the part of the Egyptian media. Black women are also targets of sexual harassment. As a remedy, the EIPR recommends that the Egyptian government ""should intensify and accelerate efforts to combat racist xenophobic views towards migrant workers, especially those of Black African origin, and to promote awareness of their positive contribution to society. The government should train all personnel working in the field of criminal justice and law enforcement officials in the spirit of respect for human rights and non-discrimination on ethnic or racial grounds.""

Maghreb (Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria, and Libya)
In March 2011, officials from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees confirmed allegations of discrimination by Tunisia against black Africans. Black Africans were reportedly targeted by rebel forces during the Libyan civil war in 2011.

Ideology
Author draws parallel between Arab nationalism and Turkish nationalism, both were ""likewise evolving into the ""racial"" stage, the ideal being a great ""Pan-Arab"" empire, embracing not merely the ethnically Arab peninsula-homeland, but also the regions of Mesopotamia, The Levant, Egypt, Tripoli, North Africa and the Sudan.""

Dr. Walid Phares writes about Arabism's denial of identity of millions of indigenous non-Arab nations as an ethnic cleansing on a politico-cultural level.

A writer on the Durban conference regarding racism suggests: That stressing out that ""Arabism is racism"" would have been an interesting debating topic. Yet, he adds that ""the OIC
countries were very clever in how they deflected the slavery issue that could so easily have been turned on them with a vengeance.""

Some Muslim activists have also expressed that ""Arabism is racism, pure and simple."" There was Sheikh Mustafa al-Maraghi, who in a famous 1938 essay dismissed the goal of [pan] Arab unity as racist.

Arab Muslim authors in ""Arab-Iranian relations"": Much ink has flowed on the issue of Arab nationalism. Some people believe it to be a racist movement, advocating the superiority of the Arabs.

A Muslim scholar writes that ""the Ba'th party, which sowed a Pan-Arabist ideology, was responsible for the genocide of Kurdish people in Iraq as well as the genocide of Shiite Arabs in Iraq, and that ""Pan-Arabism does not recognize minorities living in the Arab world. Everybody in this ""world"" is an Arab.""

Ali A. Allawi, the former Iraqi Minister of Defense and Finance, envisioning a peaceful Iraq: ""Arabism, racism and sectarianism – would be dethroned. Iraq would be at peace with itself and with its region.""

In 1960's, the French Comite d' Action de Defense De- mocratique published a pamphlet titled Racism and Pan-Arabism, its introduction followed by an article by the well known French sociologist, anthropologist & political leader: Jackes Soustelle to fight against all kinds of racism, this was followed by a paper by Shlomo Friedrich on ""Pan-Arabism: A New Racist Menace?"" who offered a sharp critique of Nasser's book The Philosophy of the Revolution, and it terms it a mere pale imitation of Hitler's Mein Kampf.

The African Liberation Forces of Mauritania speaking on slavery and genocide in the Sahel, said ""those two governments [Sudan and Mauritania] went to the same school—the school of Arabization. The professor was Saddam Hussein, and the doctrine was developed in Egypt by Nasser. They follow the pattern of Ba'athism and Nasserism. In the color of their skin they may not be Arabs, they may be Black. But they want to be Arab, and they follow this policy of Arabization in Mauritania and Sudan.""

Racism – overview

In an interview 'White Skin, Black Mask' the Tunisian-born, Algerian author Kamel Riahi explained:
""It might come as a surprise to you to learn that Negro was the term people called my black grandfather. I consider myself as someone of a Negro descent, although I am not black. Perhaps my wide nose proves this theory. Therefore, I am sympathetic towards the blacks ideologically, by heritage and by history. We, the whites, will not be liberated until we liberate ourselves from the racist views we have of other races and religions.""
He goes on in denouncing the massive common racism in the Arab world:

We still curse each other using ""you’re Jewish"" or ""you’re Kurdish"", this is also racial and religious discrimination. Watch any Egyptian sitcom and tell me about the image of the Sudanese character. Listen to the Tunisian jokes about the Libyans or jokes about people from Hums in Greater Syria. Listen to the debates regarding noble families and family lineage… even horses now are divided between what is considered ""noble"" and what is not. We are racists to the bones. Attempting to hide or silence this fact will not help with the matter because we are a sick society which still suffers from the complexes of color and race.

Some charge that ""ultra-Arabism and Jihadism have been responsible for widespread persecution and genocide."" such Saddam's using chemical weapons and gas against the Kurds during the bombings of Halabja in northern Iraq. ""The Kurds, a non-Arab people whose language belongs to the Iranian group, have suffered from persecution under the Baath of Iraq and Syria, especially since the departure of British and French forces in the late 1940s."" (Kurds are also claiming rights in Iran and Turkey.) The Berbers, the pre-Arab native peoples of North Africa, have been victimized by the Arabs in North Africa.

Kurds decried 'Arab racism' against them, and have branded ""The Arab League as a useless ideological racist Arabist institution.""

There're historic racial divisions, racial and religious prejudices in Iraq, including on Kurds, on Shia and the Marsh Arabs.

Affected victims
In Sudan, including the Nuba Mountains and Blue Nile regions, from 1955 to 2005, it is estimated that nearly 4 million black people were killed or ethnically cleansed. During the Second Sudanese Civil War, about 2.5 million people were killed in attacks widely regarded as racially motivated against black indigenous Africans.

Racism has been documented in Libya, including the 2000 anti-African racist violence. They have reported facing racism in the country, with one witness reporting being called a ""slave"" and ""animal."" From the start of Libyan Civil War in 2011, blacks were massacred for their skin color according to an Amnesty International report.

In Algeria victims of racism include Sub-Saharan immigrants who suffer daily from verbal attacks and other forms of discrimination. Many Sub-Saharan immigrants find themselves on the street due to lack of public resources. The homeless immigrants often quote the Quran in an effort to appeal to the country's Muslim unity and divert attention from their race. On the world stage the country has declared that members of its national football team must undergo a stricter selection process if they possess dual citizenship to ensure their loyalty to the country.

Some of the persecuted victims of racism and discrimination in the Arab world include: Sub-Saharan Africans in Egypt, including on Eritreans, and oppressing Darfurian refugees, Algeria, Mauritania – fighting off racist policies in these countries, in Iraq where blacks face racism, Kurds in Syria and in Iraq, Copts,

it worsened under pan-Arabism by Nasser and with the empowerment of the Muslim Brotherhood. Al-Akhdam in Yemen, as well as slaves who fight the stigma of their status as 'slaves' in impoverished Yemen, Persians' historic struggle against the 'Arab supremacy,' Berbers in North Africa (Moroccos, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya ), South Asians and Southeast Asians (migrant workers and maids in the Gulf Arab nations), Jews (see: Antisemitism in the Arab world, in a 2009 PEW poll, 90% of the Middle East were found to view Jews unfavorably). Although slavery was officially abolished in 1981, a 2012 CNN report suggested that 10% to 20% of the Mauritanian population was enslaved with a correlation with skin color – darker-skinned Mauritanians were often enslaved by lighter-skinned.

The professional league operated from 1972 to 1979, but only held its annual draft from 1973 through 1978.

The fledgling WHA had some trouble stocking their teams, with many of the players drafted by WHA teams never reporting, preferring instead to play in the long established National Hockey League. In 1975, only three of the fifteen first-round picks played a game in the new league. Other players would only be lured with extravagant salaries, such as the $1.3 million ($ million today) contract Pat Price signed with the Vancouver Blazers in 1974.

The WHA held a secretive, short draft in February of 1978 without releasing the names of the drafted players with the expectation of having their regular amateur draft in June of that year.  The June draft was never held.

First overall picks
List of first overall picks:

Of the five first overall draft picks selected in the WHA Amateur Draft, Bob Neely and Blair Chapman never reported to the league. Pat Price, drafted after a 95-point season as a defenceman in junior hockey, was considered an expensive flop, though he was drafted by the New York Islanders after only one year in Vancouver and went on to a 13-year career in the NHL. Only Scott Campbell and Claude Larose had reasonably active and prosperous WHA careers.

The WHA draft was abandoned in 1978 when merger talks with the NHL broke down.  The league instead encouraged teams to negotiate with junior players as free agents, including underage players.

The venues were the London Velopark for track cycling and BMX, and Hadleigh Farm, in Essex, for mountain biking. The road races took place over a course starting and ending in The Mall in central London and heading out into Surrey, while the time trials started and finished at Hampton Court Palace in Richmond upon Thames. Eighteen events were contested and around 500 athletes participated.

Cycling events have been contested in every Summer Olympics programme since the first modern Olympiad in 1896 alongside athletics, artistic gymnastics, fencing and swimming. Compared to the cycling at the 2008 Olympics, there were many changes in the Olympic track cycling programme. The men's and women's individual pursuit and points race, and the men's Madison were removed. Team sprint, team pursuit and keirin were added to the women's programme, while Omnium was a new race for both men and women. Countries were restricted to one entry per track event, a restriction which seemed to be directed at preventing the British team from double-medalling in the same event as they had in four events in 2008, thus lowering their medal chances.  However, similar to the 2008 Beijing Games, the cycling events were dominated by the British team, which, with a haul including eight gold medals, was the only one to win more than a single gold medal.

Venues
The road racing at the Olympics and Paralympic Games was originally scheduled to take place in Regent's Park and on Hampstead Heath. Instead, the Olympic road races started and finished on The Mall in central London and headed out in a south-westerly direction to include loops around Box Hill in Surrey. Road racing in the Paralympics took place at Brands Hatch. The Olympic mountain bike event took place at Hadleigh Farm after the UCI labeled the course at Weald Country Park ""too easy"" in July 2008. It was touted that the course could be created in Wales. A location in Kent was also considered.

The programme was well received by critics. It was also presented as a part to the World Autism Awareness Day at the United Nations.

Plot
Ayellet (Alma Zack) makes good money as the village tailor, and when her father, Meir (Yehuda Barkan), turns to agricultural politics, her husband, Yaniv, turns the family farm into a profitable business exporting yellow peppers. Both men help her raise Natty, her teenage daughter from a former marriage, and Omri, her toddler son from her present one. The few indications she has of Omri's developmental problem do not bother her because the village physician says everything is okay.

When Ayellet's brother, Avshy, returns to the village, it seems like a new opportunity: Avshy will replace Yaniv in the greenhouses, and Yaniv will build their new biker restaurant. However, Avshy's wife, Yaely, a physician, wants to give her marriage a second chance and comes with her husband to live on the farm. Yaely is concerned about Omri's symptoms. Meir drives the child to the closest town, where he is diagnosed as autistic.

Ayellet removes Omri from kindergarten, and the family organizes an intensive therapeutic homeschooling plan. Ayellet stops spending time with her daughter and stops working. No money is left for completing the restaurant. Ayellet fires her brother from managing the greenhouses, and he becomes depressed and leaves his wife. Yaniv stops participating the homeschooling.

Yaniv wants Ayellet to get pregnant again, but she refuses.

Yaniv fights with Ayellet about taking Omri to community events. Yaniv wants to take him to a party at the preschool, but Omri disappears. Yaniv forces Ayellet to tell the police and the village, who are searching for Omri, that he is autistic. The family explains to everyone that calling Omri by his name will not make him answer. When night falls, Omri is found in the preschool.

The anonymous Italian text, almost certainly by a Tuscan author, is a version of the Latin Actus beati Francisci et sociorum eius, of which the earliest extant manuscript is one of 1390 AD. Luke Wadding ascribes the text to Father Ugolino da Santa Maria, whose name occurs three times in the Actus. Most scholars are now agreed that the author was Ugolino Brunforte ( – c. 1348).

History
Little Flowers of Francis of Assisi is the name given to the classic collection of popular legends about the life of St. Francis of Assisi and his early companions. The collection, one of the most delightful literary works of the Middle Ages, was translated into Italian by an unknown fourteenth-century friar from a larger Latin work, the ""Actus B. Francisci et Sociorum Ejus"", attributed to Ugolino Brunforte. Or rather the fifty-three chapters which form the true text of the Fioretti were; the four appendixes (on the Stigmata of St. Francis, the life of Fra Ginepro, and the life and the sayings of the Fra Egidio) are additions of later compilers.

A striking difference is noticeable between the earlier chapters of the ""Fioretti"", which refer to St. Francis and his companions, and the later ones which deal with the friars in the province of the March of Ancona. The first half of the collection reflects traditions that go back to the early days of the order; the other is believed to be substantially the work of Fra Ugolino da Monte Giorgio of the noble family of Brunforte.

Living as he did a century after the death of St. Francis, Ugolino was dependent on hearsay for much of his information; part of it he is said to have learned from Fra Giacomo da Massa who had been well known and esteemed by the companions of the saint. Whatever may have been the sources from which Ugolino derived his materials, the fifty-three chapters which constitute the Latin work in question seem to have been written before 1328.

Stories 
Written a century and a half after the death of Francis of Assisi, the text is not regarded as an important primary source for the saint's biography. However, it has been the most popular account of his life and relates many colourful anecdotes, miracles and pious examples from the lives of Francis and his followers (such as Brother Juniper). These poetic stories shed much light upon the genesis and development of the following of Saint Francis.

Some stories contained in the Fioretti can be found in much earlier works. Fioretti di San Francesco, Chapter 13: Preaching to the Birds relates that Francis, Friar Masseo and Friar Agnolo traveled to and preached at a city called Saburniano (Cannara). Those that heard them were so inflamed by their message that they desired to leave the city and follow these friars into the wilderness. Francis told them that such a thing was not necessary, but instead he established the Third Order ""for the universal salvation of all people"". Francis had already been concerned about the expansion of his order at the expense of families. He refused entrance to his order by married men (and the women from admission to the Poor Clares) who sought to follow the Franciscan way, because families should not suffer. Francis preaching to the birds was described by Fra Masseo, and written of by the Englishman Roger of Wendover, in 1236.

The vernacular version is written in Tuscan and is reckoned among the masterpieces of Italian literature. Arthur Livingstone, author of a 1930s edition of the Little Flowers, characterizes it as ""a masterful work of folk literature from the Middle Ages"".

The earliest manuscript is dated 1390, and is in Berlin. The Italian translation was first printed at Vicenza in 1477.

In popular culture
The text was the inspiration for the Roberto Rossellini's 1950 film Francesco, giullare di Dio (Francis, God's Jester), which was co-written by Federico Fellini. It was also used as a source for the libretto of Olivier Messiaen's opera Saint-François d'Assise.

Song background
""Sylvia's Mother"" is autobiographical, with songwriter Shel Silverstein drawing upon his unsuccessful attempt to revive a failed relationship. Silverstein had been in love with a woman named Sylvia Pandolfi, but she would later become engaged to another man and end up as a museum curator at the Museo de Arte Carrillo Gil in Mexico City. Desperate to continue the relationship, Silverstein called Pandolfi's mother, Louisa, but she told him that the love had ended.

The lyrics tell the story in much the same way: A man, despondent after learning that Sylvia, with whom he had an earlier relationship, is leaving town, tries to telephone her to say one last goodbye. However, Sylvia's mother (Mrs. Avery) tells him that Sylvia is engaged to be married, and is trying to start a new life in Galveston, Texas. She asks the man not to say anything to her because she might start crying and want to stay. She tells the man Sylvia is hurrying to catch a 9 o'clock train. She then returns to the phone conversation, thanks the (unnamed) narrator for calling. The pathos lies in the singer's awareness that Sylvia is right there with her mother, Sylvia being unaware that he is the man on the phone. Throughout the phone conversation, an operator interrupts to ask for more money (""40 cents more for the next three minutes"") to continue the call.

Bobby Bare cover

In 1972, about the same time the Dr. Hook version was on the chart, country singer Bobby Bare recorded a cover version. Bare's version became a hit, reaching No. 12 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles chart that October. One of his last hit records during his stay at Mercury Records, ""Sylvia's Mother"" became the first of many Silverstein-penned songs Bare had success with, and would foreshadow both an entire album dedicated to Silverstein-penned songs (1973's Bobby Bare Sings Lullabys, Legends and Lies) and hit records written by Silverstein, including ""Marie Laveau,"" ""The Winner,"" ""Rosalie's Good Eats Café"", ""The Mermaid"", ""Warm and Free"" and others.

Its productions included The Wolf of Wall Street and Dumb and Dumber To. It was dissolved in 2018 after being implicated in the 1Malaysia Development Berhad corruption scandal.

History

Red Granite Pictures made its debut with Friends with Kids, a romantic comedy written and directed by Jennifer Westfeldt. They then executive-produced the thriller Out of the Furnace as well as the 2013 film The Wolf of Wall Street. The latter was directed by Martin Scorsese and stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Margot Robbie and Jonah Hill. The film is based on the memoir of the same name by former stockbroker Jordan Belfort. Red Granite Pictures then produced films such as Dumb and Dumber To and the 2017 film Papillon which was based on the best-selling autobiography by the French convict Henri Charrière. They went defunct in 2018 due to an embezzlement scandal.

Controversies
The producers of the 1994 film Dumb and Dumber claimed Red Granite Pictures pushed them out of producing the 2014 sequel. On July 16, 2014, plaintiffs withdrew their racketeering claim with prejudice, meaning it could not be refiled, which was characterized as a strong suggestion that the lawsuit underlying it had been settled. On July 18, 2014, a request for dismissal was filed in Los Angeles Superior Court and the case was officially settled.  The announcement of the settlement lists the plaintiffs as executive producers, and all claims of racketeering made against Red Granite, Riza Aziz and Joey McFarland were withdrawn.  The plaintiffs said in a statement, “We apologize for naming Riza Aziz and Joey McFarland as individual defendants rather than just Red Granite.”

Red Granite Pictures was caught up in the 1Malaysia Development Berhad scandal. The alleged use of funds stolen from 1MDB is detailed in the book Billion Dollar Whale by Tom Wright and Bradley Hope. In 2016, the FBI issued subpoenas to several past and present employees of the company in regard to allegations that US$155 million was diverted from 1MDB to help finance the 2013 film The Wolf of Wall Street. Red Granite Pictures, which has the ex-Malaysian Prime Minister's stepson, Riza Aziz, as its co-founder and chairman, denied any wrongdoing. However, in March 2018, Red Granite Pictures agreed to pay $60 million to the US government in order to settle a civil lawsuit alleging that its movies were funded in part by money siphoned from 1MDB.

Although now passing through South Yorkshire, Derbyshire and Greater Manchester, it historically formed the ancient county boundary between Cheshire and Derbyshire. The upper valley is known as Longdendale. The river has a watershed of approximately , and the area an annual rainfall of .

Course

Rising in the Redhole Spring and Wike Head area of Pikenaze Moor in Derbyshire, the river broadens into the Longdendale Chain of reservoirs in the Peak District National Park. It emerges again in Tintwistle, Derbyshire, at the foot of Bottoms Reservoir dam and passes Melandra Castle in Gamesley, where it is joined by Glossop Brook.  The Etherow enters the borough of Tameside at Hollingworth in Greater Manchester, passing into Stockport where it passes through Etherow Country Park. It flows into the River Goyt at Brabyns Park near Marple.

The modern accepted start of the River Mersey is at the confluence of the Tame and Goyt, in central Stockport,  downstream. However, older definitions, and many older maps, place its start at the confluence of the Etherow and Goyt; for example the 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica states ""It is formed by the junction of the Goyt and the Etherow a short distance below Marple in Cheshire on the first-named stream."" John Stockdale's map published on 12 April 1794 shows the Mersey River extending to at least Mottram, and forming the boundary between Cheshire and Derbyshire.

Natural history

The upper reaches of the River Etherow pass through peat moorland, inhabited by red foxes, voles and an introduced population of mountain hare.  Red grouse, ring ouzel, wheatear and golden plover may be seen.  Kestrels, merlins and short-eared owls nest here. The reservoirs attract mallards, and also teal, pochard, common sandpipers, black-headed gulls and Canada geese. The woodlands are home to redstart, great spotted woodpecker, and spotted flycatcher. Water rail have been recorded at Etherow Country Park.

Geology

Longdendale is a steep-sided V-shaped valley that is glacial in origin. Longdendale is in the Dark Peak, where a thick blanket of peat overlies the Millstone Grit sandstone, formed on a bed of shale through which flows the Etherow. Directly beneath the upper valley lie areas of Carboniferous Millstone Grit, shales and sandstone. It is on the edge of the Peak District Dome, at the southern edge of the Pennine anticline. The Variscan uplift has caused much faulting and Glossopdale was the product of glacial action in the last glaciation period that exploited the weakened rocks. The steep-sided valleys of the cloughs cause significant erosion and deposition. The layers of sandstone, mudstones and shale in the bedrock act as an aquifer to feed the springs. The valley bottoms have a thin deposit of boulder clay. The brooks are fed by the peaty soils of the moors and are, therefore, acidic (pH5.5–7.0).

History
The Etherow valley was an important trans-Pennine route, and in AD 78 the Romans under Agricola built the fort of Ardotalia (later known as Melandra or Melandra Castle) to defend it. The Mercians settled at Hollingworth about 650 AD. Many placenames of the area date from this period; for example, Mottram and Glossop. At the time of Domesday (1086) the river was firmly established as the boundary between Cheshire and Derbyshire, but the name Edrow or Etherow applied to this upper reach of the Mersey cannot be dated earlier than c.1772.

A packhorse route (known as a saltway) was maintained from the Middle Ages onwards to allow the export of salt from the Cheshire towns of Nantwich, Northwich and Middlewich across the Pennines. The saltway followed the Etherow to Ladyshaw, and at Salters Brook () it forked, with one route leading to Wakefield and another to Barnsley.

Water was an important source of power for industry, and the Etherow and its tributaries were fast flowing and constant. Watermills were used to grind meal and to full woollen cloth (Littlemoor 1781). Wool was transported along the turnpike road (1731) that ran from Ashton-under-Lyne, Stalybridge, Mottram, Woodhead and Lady's Cross to Sheffield, to be woven on hand-looms in the dale.

From 1782 to 1820, water-powered cotton mills were built along many brooks feeding the Etherow, including six on the Glossop side of the river. With the adoption of steam to power the ever-larger mills, built closer to the coal fields, the river assumed a new role as a source of water for Manchester and Salford. In 1844 John Frederick Bateman advised Manchester Corporation that the River Etherow, which rose at the highest point of the Pennine chain, could provide water, collected in purpose-built reservoirs, ""nearly as pure as if it comes from the heavens.""  This led to the construction of the Longdendale Chain of reservoirs, the first scheme of its type in the world. Three reservoirs were built on the Etherow to impound drinking water, with another two to provide compensation water for the mills downstream.

Etymology
The name Etherow could be of Brittonic Celtic origin and derived from the ancient term *ador, meaning ""watercourse, channel"". The settlement-name Tintwistle, however, implies that Etherow may be an Old English replacement for an earlier name of the *Tin- type (see River Tyne), derived from the hydronym *edre, which is possibly related to ēdre, ""vein"".

Economy

The Longdendale Chain of reservoirs comprises three impounding reservoirs, Woodhead Reservoir, Torside Reservoir and Rhodeswood Reservoir, supplying  of water a day by gravity to Manchester and Salford, and  to Hyde and Denton through the Mottram tunnel. Valehouse Reservoir and Bottoms Reservoir are compensating reservoirs which have a combined holding capacity of .

Woodhead railway line

The Woodhead Line, which followed the river from Hadfield to the Woodhead Tunnel portal, was an important cross-Pennine route built in 1844 by the Sheffield, Ashton-under-Lyne and Manchester Railway.  Three tunnels of  were dug, connecting Woodhead with Dunford Bridge on the River Don. Though now closed to railway traffic, one tunnel is used to route electricity cables for the National Grid, with work in progress to use a second tunnel for a new cable, thus preventing the re-establishment of rail traffic.

Recreation

Walking and cycling

Following the closure of the railway line, the trackbed was taken up and the Longdendale Trail constructed along its route. This is now part of the Trans-Pennine Trail,  Sustrans National Cycle Route 62. This, in its turn, is part of the  European walking route E8 from Liverpool to Istanbul. The Pennine Way crosses Longdendale, descending from Bleaklow to the south and ascending Black Hill to the north. The youth hostel at Crowden is a traditional stop after the first day's walking, from Edale.

The circular walk known as 'The Longdendale Edges' takes in the high ground (at about the - level) on both sides of the valley. It is about  long and is 'not recommended in doubtful weather'.  The detailed route, clockwise from Crowden Youth Hostel, is given in Peak District Walking Guide No.2, published by the Peak Park Planning Board.

Sailing
Torside Reservoir is home to Glossop & District Sailing Club and Etherow Country Park is the home to Etherow Country Park Sailing Club.

Country Park

Etherow Country Park, in Compstall, close to the mouth of the Etherow, opened in 1968 as one of the UK's first country parks.  Originally it was an industrial area incorporating a mine, a mill and a mill pond. The River Etherow flows through the park and is the source for the mill pond. Etherow Country Park is associated with many local groups, including a small local community group, the Friends of Etherow, anglers, the afore-mentioned sailing club, and a model boat club.

Compstall Nature Reserve is a  region of the park which is designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). The area was given the designation in 1977 for its biological interest, in particular its wide range of habitats, including open water, tall fen, reed swamp, carr and mixed deciduous woodland.

APKWS is approximately one-third the cost and one-third the weight of the current inventory of laser-guided weapons, has a lower yield more suitable for avoiding collateral damage, and takes one quarter of the time for ordnance personnel to load and unload.

Development
Where possible the system utilizes existing Hydra 70 components such as launchers, rocket motors, warheads and fuzes.  The weapon bridges the gap between the Hydra 70 and AGM-114 Hellfire systems and provides a cost-effective method of engaging lightly armored point targets. APKWS is the U.S. government's only Program of Record for the semi-active, laser-guided 2.75-inch (70 millimeter) rocket.

It converts the Hydra 70 unguided rocket into a precision guided munition through the addition of a mid-body guidance unit developed by BAE Systems. The APKWS has also been successfully tested in live fire exercises with the Forges de Zeebrugge unguided rocket, converting it into a precision guided munition and demonstrating the technology can be used on other rocket types than the Hydra 70.

Design

The winning bidder for the APKWS II contract was the team of BAE Systems, Northrop Grumman and General Dynamics, beating the offerings from Lockheed Martin and Raytheon Systems.

The APKWS II uses the Distributed Aperture Semi-Active Laser Seeker (DASALS) technology. This system allows a laser seeker to be located in the leading edge of each of the forward control canards, working in unison as if they were a single seeker. This configuration allows existing warheads from the Hydra 70 system to be used without the need for a laser seeker in the missile nose.

The APKWS II system is composed of the launch platform, rockets equipped with the WGU-59/B mid-body guidance unit, the lengthened 7-tube LAU-68 F/A rocket launcher, the SCS 7 aiming cue (not needed for attack helicopters), and Fastpack PA-140 and CNU-711/E storage kits for rockets and guidance kits, respectively, to ensure they are safe in the field.  The WGU-59/B mid-body guidance unit is equipped with DASALS seeker optics which deploy 0.5 seconds after launch. They are attached in between the Mk 66 Mod 4 rocket motor and a warhead and fuze, which increases length by  and weight by  over the legacy Hydra system.

Firing ranges are 1,100-5,000 meters, the former of which can be hit less than 5 seconds after firing. Maximum range is constrained by use of the existing Hydra 70 motor, but since the seeker can see as far as , a more powerful motor could extend range while retaining accuracy. Nammo is working on a modified rocket motor that can extend range to .

A software upgrade of the APKWS will be applied starting in late 2021; the upgrade increases range by 30% by means of an optimized flight trajectory to engage targets at a steeper angle of attack, while also being qualified on both fixed- and rotary-wing aircraft in a single variant and improving the surface danger zone logic for better training range options.

In June 2021, BAE successfully tested the APKWS in a counter-unmanned aerial systems (C-UAS) role. An APKWS-equipped rocket was fitted with a proximity fuze and destroyed a Class 2 UAS. The proximity fuze enables it to intercept UAS at a lower cost than other methods, and due to the rocket's laser guidance that activates on launch it does not require locking on to the target before launch.

In December 2019, the 85th Test and Evaluation Squadron at Eglin AFB, Florida, conducted a test using APKWS rocket against a drone representing a cruise missile. By adapting the rocket for cruise missile defense, it can serve the same role as the much more expensive AIM-120 missile, according to an Air Force release. ""The test was unprecedented and will shape the future of how the Air Force executes CMD,"" Col. Ryan Messer, commander of the 53d Wing at Eglin, said in a release. ""This is a prime example of how the 53d Wing is using resources readily available to establish innovative ways that enhance combat capabilities for our combat units.""

In June 2020, BAE announced they had completed test firings of the APKWS from a ground launcher for the first time. Several rockets were fired from an Arnold Defense-built launcher called the Fletcher designed specifically for ground vehicles, demonstrating the weapon's ability to address a demand for standoff ground-to-ground precision munitions for small ground units.

Foreign users
On 14 April 2014, the U.S. Navy signed an agreement with the Jordanian Air Force for the first international sale of the APKWS for use on the CN-235 gunship. Jordan received 110 units in late November 2015.

In November 2014, the State Department approved the sale of up to 2,000 APKWS rockets to Iraq.

In June 2015, a deal to sell 6 A-29 Super Tucano light attack aircraft to the Lebanese Air Force was approved that included the sale of 2,000 APKWS rockets for use on the turboprops. The  million sale was financed by Saudi Arabia.

In April 2018, The U.S. State Department approved the future sale of APKWS units to the Mexican Navy at the same time that they approved the sale of eight MH-60R helicopters.

Ukraine is being supplied with APKWS rockets following the 2022 Russia invasion of Ukraine. As part of an aid package announced by the U.S. in August 2022, the L3Harris Vehicle-Agnostic Modular Palletized ISR Rocket Equipment (Vampire) system will be sent to Ukraine. The system consists of a sensor ball and a four-barreled APKWS rocket launcher that can be mounted on trucks. While it can direct laser-guided rockets on ground targets, the Pentagon specified it as a counter-UAS system. The kit could be ready by May 2023.

Charming, ) — also Nain or Naim in English — is an Arab village in northern Israel. Located in the Lower Galilee,  south of Nazareth, Nein covers a land area of approximately  and falls under the jurisdiction of Bustan al-Marj Regional Council, whose headquarters it hosts. Its total land area consisted of 3,737 dunums prior to 1962. According to the Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics, in  it had a population of .

Location
Nein lies a short distance from Mount Tabor. A hill known in Arabic as Tell el-Ajul lay on the path that ran between Nein and nearby Indur, an Arab village destroyed in the 1948 Arab-Israeli war. Biblical archaeologist Edward Robinson describes Nein as lying on the northern slope of a hill called ""the little Hermon"", and it is described in biblical guidebooks as lying at the foot of the Hill of Moreh.

History

Antiquity
Rock-sunk tombs have been found here, probably of Christian origin.

Nein is mentioned in the writing of Eusebius (c. 263–339) and Jerome (c. 347–420) as being situated near Endor (Indur). Its identity as a biblical site was recognized by the Crusaders, who built a church there to commemorate the site of the miracle, a church rebuilt by the Franciscans.

In 1101,  during the Crusader era, Tancred, Prince of Galilee granted   Nein together with several other villages to the abbey of Mount Tabor.  In 1153, it belonged to the Hospitallers.  By 1263, the area was ruled by Baybars.

Ottoman era
Nein, like the rest of Palestine, was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1517, and in the census of 1596, the village was located  in the nahiya of Safa in the liwa of Lajjun. It had a population of 119 households, all Muslim. They paid a fixed  tax-rate of 25% on agricultural products, including wheat, barley, summer crops, olive trees, goats and beehives, in addition to winter pastures and occasional revenues;  the taxes totalled 80,000  akçe.

In 1838 Robinson and Smith  noted that Nein had decreased in size over the ages, and was at  time a small hamlet, inhabited by  a few families.  In 1875 Victor Guérin  saw here a ruined building, measuring 18 times 12 paces.

In  the Palestine Exploration Fund's Survey of Western Palestine (1882),  Nein was described as a small village made of stone and adobe, with a small mosque, named Mukam Sidna Aisa, to the north.

British Mandate era
In the  1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British authorities, Nain had a population of 157, all Muslims, increasing in the 1931 census to 189, still all Muslim, in a total of 34  houses.

In  the 1945 statistics  the population was 270, all Muslims,  while the total land area was , according to an official land and population survey. Of this,  were for plantations and irrigable land, 3,602  for cereals, while 31 dunams were classified as built-up areas.

New Testament associations

Edward Robinson and Eli Smith, who visited Palestine in the mid-19th century, identified Nein as, ""the Nain of the New Testament"" () where, according to Luke , Jesus raised a young man from death and reunited him with his mother. According to Luke's account, this young man was the only son of an unnamed widow. When Jesus saw the dead son being carried out and the mourning widow, he felt compassion for her. He walked towards the bier or stretcher, touched it, stopped the funeral procession and told the man: ""Young man, I say to you, arise!"" The man came alive, sat up, and began to speak. The people who were standing around were all  struck by the event, seen as a sign that 'a great prophet' had arisen among them, and the report of it spread widely across Judea and the surrounding region. Nain is not mentioned in the other canonical gospels.

Biography 
Ķuzis joined the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party in 1905. According to his former subordinate, Walter Krivitsky, Ķuzis led a guerrilla detachment in his native Latvia at the age of 16, during the 1905 revolution, and was wounded, caught and sentenced to death.  His sentence was commuted because of his youth; after two years in prison, he was deported to Siberia, but escaped. Rearrested and sent back into exile in 1911, he escaped in 1914, and was a private in Russian army until he deserted, in 1916.

Ķuzis joined the Bolsheviks after the Russian Revolution, rising to the rank of general and chief of the Latvian Red Army. From December 1917, he operated in the apparatus of the Cheka and became a principal organizer of Lenin's Red Terror, credited with devising the system of taking and shooting hostages to recover deserters and to put down peasant rebellions in areas controlled by the Red Army. He was recognized by his superiors for his work in pursuing, arresting, and liquidating Russian sailors after the Bolshevik suppression of the Kronstadt rebellion in March 1921. Promoted to head of the Red Army's Fourth Bureau (military intelligence), the GRU, he served from 1920 to 1935.  Among his agents was the prominent German spy Richard Sorge.

He was dismissed in 1935, and served for a year in the Far East. In September 1936, he was sent to Madrid, under the nom de guerre Grishin, as chief military adviser to the Republican side in the Spanish Civil War. In November he transferred to Valencia. On 8 June 1937 he was recalled to Moscow and reappointed to his old post as head of military intelligence on 8 June 1937, after his successor Semyon Uritsky had come under suspicion, but on 1 August 1937 he too was dismissed, and succeeded by A.M. Nikonov, who was also dismissed and arrested a few days later. During the Great Purge as a part of the Latvian Operation of the NKVD, Berzin was arrested by the NKVD on 13 May 1938, and shot on 29 July 1938.

He was rehabilitated in 1956.

Other details 
On 14 December 1948 Alexander Barmine, former chargé d'affaires at the Soviet embassy in Athens, Greece, advised Federal Bureau of Investigation agents that Berzin informed him prior to Barmine's 1937 defection that Owen Lattimore, head of the U.S. Office of War Information in the Pacific during World War II, was a Soviet agent.

Berzin appears in the Venona decrypts under the code name ""Starik"" ( – ""Old man"").

Early life and education
Whitworth was possibly born at Blore Pipe, near Eccleshall, Staffordshire. He entered Westminster School as a Queen's Scholar in 1690, and then entered Trinity College, Cambridge in 1694. He graduated with a BA in 1699 and became a Fellow the next year.

Diplomatic career
Whitworth entered diplomatic service in 1700 as secretary to George Stepney, envoy at Berlin. In November 1701 he was appointed as British aide to Cardinal Lamberg, the Holy Roman Emperor's chief commissary at the Congress of Regensburg. He also deputised at Vienna for Stepney, when he was absent from the embassy there.

In 1704, Whitworth was appointed as Ambassador Extraordinary to Russia.  His initial role was to regularise the position of the Russia Company which had mismanaged the tobacco monopoly granted it in 1698. He succeeded in this between 1707 and 1711, but not in the wider object of obtaining a commercial treaty. He also had to handle Russian sensibilities over the arrest for debt in 1708 of the emperor's envoy Andrey Matveyev, sent to London to seek British mediation in the Great Northern War.  He remained accredited in Russia until 1712, but was increasingly absent on diplomatic business elsewhere in eastern Europe.  He was charged by Queen Anne to discover and evaluate high-level Russian strategies.  He closely observed public events and noted the changing the power status of key leaders. He cultivated influential and knowledgeable persons at the royal court, and befriended foreigners in Russia's service, and in turn they provided insights into high-level Russian planning and personalities, which he summarized and sent in code to London.  He wrote an Account of Russia as it was in the Year 1710, which (though not published until 1758) influenced British views of Russia for much of the century.

In December 1713, he was appointed as one of the commissaries to treat with the French concerning the Treaty of Navigation and Commerce concluded at Utrecht.  In April 1714 he was sent to Augsburg to observe negotiations between the emperor and France, taking place at Baden that summer.  This was followed by his appointment as British minister to the Eternal Imperial Diet at Regensburg.

In August 1716, when he was appointed envoy at Berlin, but was seconded to The Hague, to try to persuade the Netherlands to conform to the British embargo on Sweden.

Whitworth returned to Berlin in 1719, where the following year, he married the comtesse de Vaulgremont (died 1734), the daughter of a government official in French-speaking Flanders.  He was raised to the Irish peerage as Baron Whitworth, of Galway, in 1721.  In 1722, he became Member of Parliament for Newport, Isle of Wight. He died childless in 1725, upon which his barony became extinct.

Whitworth was buried at Westminster Abbey, his grave is in the South choir aisle.

A form of vigilantism and often a more structured kind of lynch mob, the term is commonly associated with the frontier areas of the American West in the mid-19th century, where groups attacked cattle rustlers and people at gold mining claims; held kangaroo courts; and beat, killed, or exiled those they believed had violated their preferred norms (sometimes on a thin pretext of such, motivated by personal or mercenary gain). As non-state organizations, no functioning checks existed to protect against excessive force or safeguard ""due process"" from the committees.  In the years prior to the Civil War, some committees worked to free slaves and transport them to freedom.

Assisting fugitive slaves

Between 1850 and 1860, following passage of the hated Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, when professional bounty hunters swarmed through Northern states searching for missing slaves, vigilance committees were set up in several places in the North to assist the escaped slaves. Gerrit Smith called the Fugitive Slave Convention of 1850 ""in behalf of the New York State Vigilance Committee"".

In the West
In the western United States, both before and after the Civil War, the stated purpose of these committees was to maintain law and order and administer summary justice where governmental law enforcement was inadequate. In reality, they were often used by those high in the social hierarchy to attack unfavored groups, including recent immigrants and racial or ethnic groups. In newly-settled areas, vigilance committees promised security and mediated land disputes. In ranching areas, they ruled on ranch boundaries, registered brands, and protected cattle and horses. In the mining districts, they protected claims, settled claim disputes, and attempted to protect miners and other residents. In California, some residents formed vigilance committees to take control from officials whom they considered to be corrupt. This took place during the trial of Charles Cora (Husband of Belle Cora) and James Casey in San Francisco during 1856.

Disbandment 
Vigilance committees were generally abandoned when the conditions favoring their creation ceased or when government officials made a show of force. In the west, as governmental enforcement increased and courts could dispense justice, residents abandoned the committees.

Nature 
Vigilance committees, by their nature, lacked an outside set of checks and balances, often making them a tool of abuse.

In the West, the speed of the vigilance committees and lack of safeguards sometimes led to the innocent being hanged or to their just disappearing. A few committees were taken over by fraudulent individuals seeking profit or political office.

United States vigilance committees 

in 1835, a Vigilance Committee in Nashville, Tennessee, was responsible, after a kangaroo court ""conviction"", for the public whipping of Rev. Amos Dresser for the crime of distributing abolitionist publications (which he claimed he did not do). The names of all 62 members of the self-appointed vigilance committee were published by the American Anti-Slavery Society, annotating some as ""Elder in the Presbyterian Church"", and the like.*

Vigilance Committee of the Gaelic Athletic Association -  A committee tasked with identifying members of the association who either played or attended ""Foreign Games"" (predominantly  soccer and rugby union) in contravention of the association's rules. The rule was in place until 1971, up to which point, many GAA players who also wished to play other sports had to resort to elaborate tactics including the wearing of disguises, the use of false names,  and travelling covertly (e.g. in the boot of a car) to attend matches.
 An Oxford Vigilance Committee was formed during World War I in Oxford, UK, a town whose own men of military age had gone to war, and where soldiers were stationed. The Committee ran volunteer patrols of women to discourage, observe, and report on what was perceived as ""immoral"" behaviour of the town's women. In November 1916, the Committee issued a report ""on the Moral Condition of Oxford,"" warning that the town's streets were ""crowded with young girls, whose dress [and] behaviour show that they are deliberately laying themselves out to attract men."" Their reports included detailed accounts of casual or adulterous sexual liaisons in the town. Births out of wedlock in Oxford decreased from 1914 to 1925, but the Committee attributed the reduction to ""forced marriages"" and abortions.

In film and media 
 The Ox-Bow Incident (1943) is a movie directed by William A. Wellman, based on the novel of the same name written by Walter Van Tilburg Clark (1940). The story tells of a group of men pursuing cattle rustlers, capturing and hanging them, and the moral consequences.
 ""Ride in the Whirlwind"" (1966) is a movie directed by Monte Hellman, written by Jack Nicholson, that tells the story of innocent men, who are thought to be part of a gang, on the run from members of a vigilance committee.

Other uses of the term 
 Vigilance Committee is also a term used by some interest groups who monitor the actions of others.

Career
Crawford began his career as a youth player with Derby County, making his professional debut on 8 March 1978 in a 4–2 victory over Liverpool in the First Division where he scores his side's first goal. The following year, he was sold to Blackburn Rovers for £50,000, scoring 23 goals in all competitions for the club in his first season as he helped them win promotion to the Second Division. However, Crawford pushed for a transfer following his breakout season but, when no club made an official approach, he went on strike and spent the majority of the 1980—81 season playing in the club's reserve side.

He eventually signed for AFC Bournemouth, who were managed by Crawford's former Derby teammate David Webb, for a fee of £40,000. He scored on his debut in a 3–0 victory over Blackpool, winning promotion to the Third Division in 1982. However, he was released in 1983 and spent a brief period with Cardiff City after being invited for a trial by manager Len Ashurst, playing six times and scoring once in a 3–1 victory over Grimsby Town.

After not being offered an extended contract, and a brief one-of appearance for Scarborough, he moved to Middlesbrough before finishing his professional career with Stockport County and Torquay United.

The name of the Algonquian language family is distinguished from the orthographically similar Algonquin dialect of the Indigenous Ojibwe language (Chippewa), which is a senior member of the Algonquian language family. The term Algonquin has been suggested to derive from the Maliseet word  (), ""they are our relatives/allies"". A number of Algonquian languages are considered extinct languages by the modern linguistic definition.

Speakers of Algonquian languages stretch from the east coast of North America to the Rocky Mountains. The proto-language from which all of the languages of the family descend, Proto-Algonquian, was spoken around 2,500 to 3,000 years ago. There is no scholarly consensus about where this language was spoken.

Family division

This subfamily of around 30 languages is divided into three groups according to geography: Plains, Central, and Eastern Algonquian; of these three, only Eastern Algonquian constitutes a true genetic subgroup.

The languages are listed below, following the classifications of Goddard (1996) and Mithun (1999). Extinct languages are marked with †, and endangered languages are noted as such. For dialects and subdialects, consult the separate main articles for each of the three divisions.

Subgroups
Eastern Algonquian is a true genetic subgrouping. The Plains Algonquian and the Central Algonquian groups are not genetic groupings but rather areal groupings. Although these areal groups often do share linguistic features, these commonalities are usually attributed to language contact. Paul Proulx has argued that this traditional view is incorrect,  and that Central Algonquian (in which he includes the Plains Algonquian languages) is a genetic subgroup, with Eastern Algonquian consisting of several different subgroups. However, this classification scheme has failed to gain acceptance from other specialists in the Algonquian languages.

Instead, the commonly accepted subgrouping scheme is that proposed by Ives Goddard (1994). The essence of this proposal is that Proto-Algonquian originated with people to the west, perhaps in the Plateau region of Idaho and Oregon or the Rocky Mountain-Great Plains boundary of Montana, and then moved east, dropping off subgroups as people migrated. By this scenario, Blackfoot was the first language to branch off, which coincides well with its being the most divergent language of Algonquian. In west-to-east order, the subsequent branchings were:
 Arapaho-Gros Ventre, Cree-Montagnais, Menominee, and Cheyenne;
 then the core Great Lakes languages: (Ojibwe–Potawatomi, Shawnee, Sauk–Fox–Kickapoo, and Miami–Illinois); and
 finally, Proto-Eastern Algonquian.

This historical reconstruction accords best with the observed levels of divergence within the family, whereby the most divergent languages are found furthest west (since they constitute the earliest branchings during eastern migration), and the shallowest subgroupings are found furthest to the east (Eastern Algonquian, and arguably Core Central). Goddard also points out that there is clear evidence for pre-historical contact between Eastern Algonquian and Cree-Montagnais, as well as between Cheyenne and Arapaho-Gros Ventre. There has long been especially extensive back-and-forth influence between Cree and Ojibwe.

It has been suggested that the ""Eastern Great Lakes"" languages – what Goddard has called ""Core Central"", e.g., Ojibwe–Potawatomi, Shawnee, Sauk–Fox–Kickapoo, and Miami-Illinois (but not Cree–Montagnais or Menominee) – may also constitute their own genetic grouping within Algonquian. They share certain intriguing lexical and phonological innovations. However, this theory has not yet been fully fleshed out and is still considered conjectural.

Algonquian is sometimes said to have included the extinct Beothuk language of Newfoundland, whose speakers were both in geographic proximity to Algonquian speakers and who share DNA in common with the Algonquian-speaking Miꞌkmaq. However, linguistic evidence is scarce and poorly recorded, and it is unlikely that reliable evidence of a connection can be found.

Grammatical features
The Algonquian language family is known for its complex polysynthetic morphology and sophisticated verb system. Statements that take many words to say in English can be expressed with a single word. Ex: (Menominee) paehtāwāēwesew ""He is heard by higher powers"" (paeht- 'hear', -āwāē- 'spirit', -wese- passivizer, -w third-person subject) or (Plains Cree) kāstāhikoyahk ""it frightens us"".  These languages have been extensively studied by Leonard Bloomfield, Ives Goddard, and others.

Algonquian nouns have an animate/inanimate contrast: some nouns are classed as animate, while all other nouns are inanimate. There is ongoing debate over whether there is a semantic significance to the categorization of nouns as animate or inanimate, with scholars arguing for it as either a clearly semantic issue, or a purely syntactic issue, along with a variety of arguments in between. More structurally inclined linguistic scholars have argued that since there is no consistent semantic system for determining the animacy of a noun, that it must be a purely linguistic characterization. Anthropological linguists have conversely argued the strong connection between animacy and items viewed as having spiritual importance.

Another important distinction involves the contrast between nouns marked as proximate and those marked as obviative. Proximate nouns are those deemed most central or important to the discourse, while obviative nouns are those less important to the discourse.

There are personal pronouns which distinguish three persons, two numbers (singular and plural), inclusive and exclusive first person plural, and proximate and obviative third persons. Verbs are divided into four classes: transitive verbs with an animate object (abbreviated ""TA""), transitive verbs with an inanimate object (""TI""), intransitive verbs with an animate subject (""AI""), and intransitive verbs with an inanimate subject (""II"").

A very notable feature of the Algonquian languages is their direct-inverse (also known as hierarchical) morphosyntactic alignment, distinguishing between an unmarked voice where the subject outranks the object in a person hierarchy and a marked voice where the opposite relation obtains.

Vocabulary
See the lists of words in the Algonquian languages and the list of words of Algonquian origin at Wiktionary, the free dictionary and Wikipedia's sibling project.

Loan words

Because Algonquian languages were some of the first with which Europeans came into contact in North America, the language family has given many words to English. Many eastern and midwestern U.S. states have names of Algonquian origin (Massachusetts, Connecticut, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin, etc.), as do many cities: Milwaukee, Chicago, et al. Ottawa, the capital of Canada, is named after the Algonquian nation, the Odawa people.

Biography
She was born in the village of Aurskog  in Akershus, Norway. Her parents, Casper Cristiansen Berg (1828-1914) and Bartha Nordbye (1829-1912) were landowners. Later, they moved to Christiania (now Oslo) where her father became a businessman. 

Originally, she trained as a nurse, then worked as a combination nurse and missionary among the Sami in Finnmark. However, she found herself attracted to painting and ultimately decided to take lessons at the  Norwegian National Academy of Craft and Art Industry (Statens håndverks- og kunstindustriskole), where she studied with Wilhelm von Hanno and Frits Thaulow. Later, she worked with Otto Sinding and followed him when he moved to Munich in Germany.

During a trip to Vienna, she saw some works by the Dutch marine painter, Hendrik Willem Mesdag, which greatly impressed her. In 1885, she had a chance meeting with him and his family. This led to studies with him at his workshop in The Hague. She became close friends with his wife, Sientje van Houten, who painted a portrait of her. In 1890, she studied briefly with Puvis de Chavannes in Paris.

Through them, she met Gooswinus Gerardus Akersloot (1843-1929), the former mayor of  Hoevelaken, who had recently lost his wife. They were married in 1893. Three years later, they settled in Oost-Vlieland where they bought the oldest house in town and named it ""Tromp's Huys"", in honor of Admiral Cornelis Tromp. Although isolated, she travelled every summer and was able to participate in exhibitions throughout  Europe. She traveled to the coast of Norway as well as to other European coastal communities to paint  coastal landscapes. In addition to painting, she ran a Sunday School and a sewing society for girls.
She remained there until her death in 1922.

""Tromp's Huys"" became a museum in 1956. Most of her approximately 300 works are kept there and sent out for exhibits, including a major retrospective at the Noordelijk Scheepvaartmuseum in 1992.  They were also shown at a special exhibition in Aurskog (1996), and another at the  in Honningsvåg, near the place where she worked with the Sami (2004).

That makes it the third-busiest station in Schleswig-Holstein. The Deutsche Bahn classifies it as a category 3 station and Elmshorn station is in the Hamburger Verkehrsverbund.

History
Elmshorn station was opened 18 September 1844, making it one of the oldest stations in the state. The Hamburg-Altona–Kiel railway should go through Barmstedt but as Elmshorn had more habitans the line went through it. Years ago there was a port railway that connected the station with the south of the harbour. It was replaced with trucks and the last tracks disappeared in 2002.

Traffic
The Regionalbahn-Schleswig-Holstein runs with trains to Neumünster, Itzehoe, Pinneberg, and Hamburg-Altona. A Regional-Express connects Hamburg Hauptbahnhof with Kiel Hauptbahnhof.

It has smooth, shiny bark, lance-shaped adult leaves, flower buds in groups of seven, white flowers and conical to hemispherical fruit.

Description
Eucalyptus ravida is a mallet that has fluted stems and typically grows to a height of  but does not form a lignotuber. It has smooth shiny greyish to brownish bark. Young plants and coppice regrowth have glaucous branchlets and bluish green to glaucous leaves that are  long and  wide and petiolate. Adult leaves are the same shade of green on both sides, glaucous at first, glossy later,  long and  wide, tapering to a petiole  long. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils in groups of seven on a flattened, unbranched peduncle  long, the individual buds sessile or on pedicels up to  long. Mature buds are oval,  long and  wide with a conical operculum. Flowering occurs from September to December and the flowers are creamy white. The fruit is a woody, conical to hemispherical capsule  long and  wide with the valve protruding strongly.

Taxonomy and naming
Eucalyptus ravida was first formally described in 1991 by Lawrence Alexander Sidney Johnson and Ken Hill in the journal Telopea. The specific epithet (ravida) is from the Latin word ravidus meaning ""greyish"", referring to the appearance of the tree caused by the glaucous twigs.

Eucalyptus ravida  is one of the six true gimlet species that have buds in groups of seven. The other true gimlets are E. campaspe , E. effusa , E. salubris, E. terebra and E. tortilis. The non-glaucous E. salubris is easily distinguished from E. ravida and E. campaspe both of which have conspicuously glaucous branchlets.

Distribution and habitat
This mallet is found on undulating plains and shallow depressions between Callion, Norseman and Zanthus in the Avon Wheatbelt, Coolgardie, Mallee and Murchison biogeographic regions.

Conservation status
This eucalypt is classified as ""not threatened"" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife.

They are responsible for the regulation of traffic, investigating traffic accidents, and operating stop lights.

The Administration is part of the Public Security Service of the MVD. The Administration has patrol jurisdiction over all Russian highways and roads.

History
The GAI (), short for State Automobile Inspectorate (), was formed on July 3, 1936. The GAI was part of the NKVD and actively starts executing tasks: fighting accidents, developing technical standards of operation of vehicles, supervises the preparation and education of drivers. And also keep records of accidents, analyze their causes, accident attracts offenders to justice, manages the issuance of license plates, data sheets, search cars, hiding from the accident scene.

In 1961 it was merged with the Road Traffic Control Department.

During the Guerilla phase of the Second Chechen war, as well as during the Insurgency in the North Caucasus, traffic safety officers were regularly targeted by Pro-Ichkerian, and later Jihadist insurgents. They made up a large portion of the law enforcement and Russian government casualties, in addition to FSB, MVD, and ГУОООП members who were assassinated or otherwise killed in action.

After the dissolution of USSR, GAI was renamed GIBDD - General Administration for Traffic Safety. There were rumors from March 2017 that the GIBDD is about to be dissolved until December 2018, as part of Russian police reform and will merged into the patrol service of the police. The Minister of Internal Affairs denied those rumors.

The film is adapted from Verily Anderson's 1958 memoir Beware of Children, under which title the film was released in the US. Anderson also wrote the screenplay.

The film has been interpreted by film scholar Wheeler Dixon as ""a gentle critique of A. S. Neill's Summerhill, whose theories were published in America in the same year as the film's release, by the Hart Publishing Company.

Harrison's Reports gave it a good review, calling it an ""uneven but well-enacted comedy by the 'Carry On ...' series film-makers.... Unobjectionable for all."" Elsewhere it is described as ""surprisingly sophisticated fare that also scores a number of interesting points about greed, privilege and class.""

Plot
David (Leslie Phillips) and Catherine Robinson (Geraldine McEwan) have inherited a large but rundown country house. David suggests they now have room to increase their family beyond their son, but, after a number of his previous business ventures have failed, his wife demurs. However, she does agree to his idea to use the house as a summer holiday home for the children of the wealthy. By advertising in The Times, they attract a number of customers, and hire a matron (June Jago) and a cook (Joan Hickson), but immediately fall foul of a local councillor, Mrs Spicer (Irene Handl), who wants the local authority to compulsorily purchase the house for a project of her own.

The children arrive, and while some are polite, scared and helpful, others are wild, spoilt, and rebellious, including an American brother and sister, and an English girl (Julia Lockwood) who insists (falsely) that she has been maltreated by her parents.

As the children grow increasingly ill-disciplined, the Robinsons and the staff struggle to keep them under control. David advocates a tough approach, while Catherine believes that the children should be allowed their freedom, but they are both undermined by a cook who is drunk most of the time.

After an illicit midnight trip out to a nearby café, the children are grounded for two days. Then the Robinsons hear that the local council is sending an inspector, who may close them down if they fail the test. They rally the staff and children, who all behave correctly when the inspector and Mrs Spicer visit.

When the time arrives for the children's parents to come to collect them, David tells them that the children are refusing to leave unless their parents promise to spend more time with them and not send them away to holiday homes and boarding schools. After the parents agree, all the children depart. Impressed by what she has seen, Mrs Spicer says she will no longer oppose the holiday home business. When their son protests at having lost his playmates, Catherine tells David that perhaps they should now have more children of their own.

The title was first established in 1967 as a secondary championship in NWA Hollywood's predecessor, Worldwide Wrestling Associates. Although the name of the title implies that it was defended throughout North, Central and South America, it was rarely defended outside of Southern California. As a result, the title was essentially a regional title rather than a national one. A number of NWA affiliated promoters at various points over the years have used their own regional versions or variations of ""national"" championships for the purpose of giving crowds the idea that the company was larger than it actually was, or that the company was the biggest or most successful within the ranks of the National Wrestling Alliance.

Biography
A native of Somerville, Massachusetts, Gill played college baseball for Holy Cross from 1916 to 1919, where he was coached by Baseball Hall of Famer Jesse Burkett. In 1916 and 1917, he played summer baseball for the Hyannis town team in what is now the Cape Cod Baseball League. At Hyannis, he pitched a no-hit, no-run game where he did not allow a ball to be hit to the outfield.

In Gill's lone season in the big leagues, he started two games and appeared in 16 total for the Senators, tossing 37.1 innings, and posting a 1–1 record with a 4.82 ERA. He made eight plate appearances, earning one base on balls and no hits. His major league debut came on July 5, when he hurled a 1-2-3 inning of relief in Washington's 6–4 loss in the first game of a doubleheader with the New York Yankees at the Polo Grounds. Gill's lone major league victory September 3 against the Philadelphia Athletics at Shibe Park. Gill tossed the first five innings and gave up two runs on four hits. He gave way to Jim Shaw, who went the rest of the way on the mound, and the Senators' Hall of Fame outfielder Sam Rice went 3–for–4 with a double, stolen base and two runs scored in the Senators' 4–3 win.

Gill died in Brockton, Massachusetts in 1995 at the age of 100.

After defeating the Mets in the NLCS in six games, the Braves would go on to lose in a sweep to the New York Yankees in the World Series in four games.

Background
After the Mets lost eight of nine games in September — including five of six to the NL East rival Braves — the Mets seemed unlikely to make the playoffs, two games out of the wild card lead with three games to play.

Following the Mets' most recent defeat in this stretch, an 11-inning loss to Atlanta at Shea Stadium, Braves third baseman Chipper Jones was quoted as saying, ""Now all the Mets fans can go home and put on their Yankees stuff."" Braves closer John Rocker was also quoted as saying he hated the Mets, and ""How many times do we have to beat them before their fans will shut up?"" Thinking they had buried the Mets, the Braves had closed out their season with another division title and were poised to enter the playoffs and leave the Mets behind.

However, the Mets swept their season-ending three-game series with the Pittsburgh Pirates at Shea Stadium, while the wild-card-leading Cincinnati Reds lost two out of three to the Milwaukee Brewers. The Mets and Reds had the same record at 95–66 heading into an eventful final day of the season. That Sunday saw the Mets win their game, 2–1, on a wild pitch in the bottom of the ninth; the Reds avoided the sweep in Milwaukee following a seven-hour rain delay. Both teams finished even with records of 96–66 after 162 games.

The Atlanta Braves captured their eighth consecutive division title with a league-best record, 103-59.  Third-baseman, Chipper Jones, was the National League's Most Valuable Player with a .319 batting average, 45 HR's, and 110 RBI.  A major factor in his selection as MVP was his performance against the New York Mets. The Braves led the National League East by only one game as they entered a three-game September series against the Mets, the team that was right on their heels. Atlanta swept the series at Turner Field, though, largely thanks to Jones, who hit four home runs and drove in seven of the 13 runs that the Braves scored. For the season, he hit .319 with a .510 on-base percentage, a 1.000 slugging percentage, and seven home runs against the Mets.   

Per MLB rules, the one game wild card playoff was held the next day, October 4, at Cincinnati's Cinergy Field. Al Leiter shut down the Reds with a two-hit shutout in a 5–0 Mets victory, sending New York to its first playoff berth since 1988 (as the wild card team, the Mets would be scheduled to play the division winner with the best record. However, since that team came from their own division — the 103–59 Braves, who also had the best record in baseball — New York faced the team with the second best record, the 100–62 Arizona Diamondbacks).

In the National League Division Series, both the Mets and Braves would advance in four games. The Mets would defeat the Arizona Diamondbacks, with the series ending on a walk-off home run by seldom-used backup catcher Todd Pratt, only playing due to a thumb injury to star catcher Mike Piazza. The Braves would vanquish the Houston Astros in four games, with Brian Jordan and eventual National League MVP Chipper Jone leading the way. And that would set up a National League Championship Series that was anticipated by many, pitting two bitter rivals against each other on the national stage. This marked the Braves' record eighth-straight appearance in the NLCS, while the Mets advanced to the league championship for the first time since 1988. This would be the second time that the Braves and Mets met in the NLCS. The two teams met in the very first National League Championship Series in 1969, with the Mets sweeping the then best-of-five set.

Prior to Game 1, Mets Manager Bobby Valentine chided the Braves, saying that ""They better be ready to play some ghosts, because we were dead and buried two weeks ago,"" in reference to earlier statements by Chipper Jones. When the series shifted to Shea Stadium in New York, raucous Mets fans would continually jeer Jones, chanting ""LARRY!"" (his given name) in derision every time he stepped to the plate. John Rocker also riled up fans, as he would often pretend to toss baseballs into the stands, and got into several arguments.

This was Atlanta’s eighth straight NLCS appearance.

Game summaries

Game 1
Tuesday, October 12, 1999, 8:12pm (EDT)  at Turner Field in Atlanta, Georgia , cloudy

The Braves began their eighth consecutive NLCS with a 4–2 victory over the Mets, defeating a team they left for dead two weeks earlier. They struck first in the first off of Masato Yoshii when Gerald Williams hit a leadoff single, stole second and scored on Brett Boone's single. The Mets tied it in the fourth on Mike Piazza's groundout with runners on first and third. The Braves retook the lead when Walt Weiss, who went 3 for 4, doubled to lead off the fifth, moved to third on a sacrifice bunt and scored on Williams's single. Future NLCS MVP Eddie Pérez's home run next inning off of Pat Mahomes made it 3–1 Braves. Andruw Jones walked to lead off the eighth off of Turk Wendell, moved to second on a sacrifice bunt, and scored on Weiss's single. Greg Maddux tossed seven solid innings and John Rocker recorded the final four outs for the save, his second of the postseason, despite allowing an RBI single to Todd Pratt in the ninth to seal Atlanta's fourth straight win.

Game 2
Wednesday, October 13, 1999, 4:09pm (EDT)  at Turner Field in Atlanta, Georgia , cloudy

Kevin Millwood held the Mets in check to win his second straight postseason start, allowing three runs—two earned—over  innings.

The Mets struck first in the second on Roger Cedeño's RBI single with two on, then made it 2–0 on Melvin Mora's home run in the fifth.

In the sixth, Chipper Jones walked before Brian Jordan's home run tied the game. After Andruw Jones singled, Eddie Pérez's home run off of Mets starter Kenny Rogers put the Braves up 4–2.

The Mets cut the lead to 4–3 in the eighth when Mora reached on third baseman Jones's error and scored on Edgardo Alfonso's double. John Rocker relieved Millwood and ended the inning without further damage, but after pitching  innings in Game 1, manager Bobby Cox turned to Game 4 starter John Smoltz for the ninth. Smoltz retired the Mets in order to give the Braves a 2–0 series lead.

Game 3
Friday, October 15, 1999,8:12pm (EDT) at Shea Stadium in Queens, New York  , clear

Tom Glavine pitched seven shutout innings and the Braves edged the Mets, 1–0, to take a commanding three-games-to-none lead in the NLCS.  The only run of the game scored in the first inning without the need for a base hit.  The lead-off runner
was walked, and two throwing errors by Al Leiter and Mike Piazza allowed the lead-off runner to score.

In 1996, the Braves won the first two games of the World Series against the Yankees. In Game 3, the Yankees rallied to beat Glavine and took the series in six games. With a superb effort from its two-time Cy Young Award winner, Atlanta avoided that fate here, setting up the possibility of its fifth World Series in the 1990s with a win in Game 4.

After Mike Remlinger worked a perfect eighth, Shea Stadium villain John Rocker perfectly played the part with a scoreless ninth. After Benny Agbayani reached on an error, the animated left-hander struck out pinch-hitter Todd Pratt, got Melvin Mora on a deep fly to right-center field and Rey Ordóñez on a weak force play.

The Mets faced an obstacle that no team in baseball history had overcome: rally from a 3–0 deficit to win a playoff series (the Boston Red Sox would become the first team ever to do it in the 2004 ALCS).

Game 4
Saturday, October 16, 1999, 7:42pm (EDT) at Shea Stadium in Queens, New York  , clear

The Mets struck first in Game 4 on John Olerud's home run in the sixth off of Braves' starter John Smoltz, but back-to-back leadoff home runs by Brian Jordan and Ryan Klesko off of Mets' starter Rick Reed put the Braves up 2–1.

The Braves were four outs from a series sweep and their fifth trip to the World Series in the 1990s when they called on John Rocker, who had treated the Mets and their fans with similar disdain during the season, with two on. The left-handed closer saved five games against New York during the regular season and two in this series. During the season, he said he hated the Mets and prior to this showdown wondered how many times the Braves would have to beat them before their fans would ""shut up.""

In a pivotal at-bat, Olerud got the better of Rocker. After a double steal, Olerud's two-run single put the Mets up 3–2 and Armando Benitez retired the Braves in order in the ninth to keep New York in the NLCS.

Game 5
Sunday, October 17, 1999, 4:09pm (EDT) at Shea Stadium in Queens, New York  ,  cloudy

Robin Ventura's bases-loaded blast off Kevin McGlinchy with one out in the bottom of the 15th inning kept the Mets' season alive with a 4–3 victory over the Braves in Game 5 of the NLCS. Ventura never made it home because he was mobbed by his teammates between first and second. Official scorer Red Foley ruled the hit (which was recently ranked the third Greatest Moment in Mets history, behind only the team's two World Series Championships) a single.

The game began shortly after 4 p.m. with Greg Maddux pitching for Atlanta and Masato Yoshii starting for the Mets. The Mets took an early 2–0 lead in the bottom of the first inning as John Olerud hit his second home run in as many days with Rickey Henderson on first. The lead lasted into the fourth inning, when Atlanta struck back with consecutive doubles by Bret Boone and Chipper Jones, eventually knotting the score at 2–2 when Brian Jordan singled home Jones. Mets Manager Bobby Valentine was immediately prompted to remove Yoshii from the game in favor of Orel Hershiser, which began a run on pitching changes that resulted in the Mets emptying their bullpen by game's end, relying on starter Kenny Rogers and rookie Octavio Dotel for key innings, and might have gone to Game 4's starter Rick Reed had the game progressed past the 15th inning. In all, the Mets used a postseason record nine pitchers in this game.

The game continued on well into the night, accompanied by a steady rainfall which did not delay the game. Although both teams mounted some threats as the game continued, neither team was able to break through for the tie-breaking run. Atlanta eventually set a mark for futility, stranding a record 19 men on base over the course of the game. A most notable failure occurred in the 13th inning, with two out and Keith Lockhart on first base and Jones at the plate. With Lockhart running, Jones laced an offering from Dotel into the right field corner. But the ball was cut off by Melvin Mora before it reached the wall, and Mora's strong relay throw, via Edgardo Alfonzo, cut down Lockhart at the plate and ended the inning.

Pitching on his 25th birthday, local villain John Rocker entered the game in the bottom of the 13th inning to a loud chorus of boos and several projectiles hurled in his direction. He retired four batters over  innings, including a strikeout of the ailing Mike Piazza. Upon being removed from the game, Rocker mocked the Shea Stadium fans by pretending to boo, and yelled at fans sitting around the Atlanta dugout as he left the field.

The Mets' season appeared over after Lockhart tripled home a run in the top of the 15th off Dotel to put the Braves ahead 3–2. However, McGlinchy could not hold the lead. Shawon Dunston, who misplayed Lockhart's triple, atoned with a leadoff single after fouling off several pitches with a full count. With pinch-hitter Matt Franco batting, Dunston stole second base. Franco eventually worked out a walk, which was followed by Edgardo Alfonzo laying down a sacrifice bunt to move Dunston to third. Olerud—whose homer in the first was now a distant memory—was intentionally walked to load the bases.

Todd Pratt, again thrust into the spotlight with Piazza nursing several injuries, hit next. McGlinchy walked Todd Pratt on five pitches and fell behind the slumping Ventura. At 9:47 p.m., McGlinchy grooved a fastball on a 2–1 count, and Ventura launched it through the steady rain and over the right-field fence. Although Ventura had seen the ball clear the wall, and was waving Pratt around the bases, Pratt tackled Ventura between first and second base, and most of the Mets team ran out on the field and mobbed Ventura in a wild scene. 

Mets manager Bobby Valentine said following the game  Valentine was speaking in reference to a calf injury that had been bothering Ventura during the postseason, and had led to his entering this game without a hit in the series.

NBC's Bob Costas gushed on the air following Ventura's blast, 

At the time, the game was the longest in terms of elapsed time in postseason history, clocking in at 5 hours, 46 minutes. It was surpassed in 2004 by Game 5 of the American League Championship Series between the Boston Red Sox and the New York Yankees, and again in 2005 in Game 4 of the National League Division Series between the Houston Astros and the Atlanta Braves, and once more in 2014 in Game 2 the NLDS between the San Francisco Giants and the Washington Nationals at Nationals Park.

This Mets victory marked just the second time in baseball history that a team had come back from a three games to none deficit in a best-of-seven series to make it to a Game 6. Coincidentally, the Braves from the previous year's NLCS against the San Diego Padres were the first.

Game 6
Tuesday, October 19, 1999, 8:12pm (EDT) at Turner Field in Atlanta, Georgia   cloudy

Kevin Millwood started for Atlanta, while Al Leiter took the start on only three days' rest for the Mets.

Leiter, unaccustomed to throwing on short rest, was tattooed in the first inning. He hit Gerald Williams with a pitch and walked Bret Boone to lead off, then catcher Mike Piazza's errant throw to third on Williams's base-stealing attempt allowed him to score and move Boone to third. After Chipper Jones was hit by a pitch, Brian Jordan's RBI single scored Boone. After Andruw Jones's fielder's choice loaded the bases, Eddie Perez's two-run single knocked Leiter out of the game. Pat Mahomes relieved Leiter and Brian Hunter's sacrifice fly made it 5–0 Braves. With Millwood looking sharp and the Mets bats quiet, it appeared through the early innings to be an Atlanta cakewalk.

Once again, the Mets had other thoughts in mind. Millwood began to tire in the sixth. An Edgardo Alfonzo leadoff double was followed by John Olerud's single before Piazza's sacrifice fly put the Mets on the board. After Robin Ventura doubled, Darryl Hamilton's single made it 5–3 Braves.

Atlanta scraped back for two runs in their half of the sixth, courtesy of a José Hernández two-run single off Dennis Cook, with both runs charged to Turk Wendell.

John Smoltz entered the game in relief for Atlanta in the seventh and after Matt Franco and Rickey Henderson hit back-to-back lead-off doubles, John Olerud singled home another run to make the score 7–5. This brought up Mike Piazza, who blasted a long home run to right off Smoltz to tie the score at 7–7.

Bob Costas said as Piazza capped the Mets incredible comeback, ""Tied at seven, hoping for Game 7!""

With the game now tied and in the hands of two completely exhausted bullpens, the game became a test of wills. The Mets took an 8–7 lead in the eighth, as rookie Melvin Mora, a virtual unknown, singled home Benny Agbayani off of Mike Remlinger. But then, with all the momentum going the Mets' way, the Braves rallied back against John Franco in the bottom of the eighth. With one out, Eddie Perez singled. Otis Nixon pinch-ran for Perez, and took the momentum back by stealing second base and going to third when Piazza's throw went into center field. Brian Hunter singled home the tying run.

In the tenth inning, the Mets once again regained the lead, and again Mora was in the center of things. His one-out single off John Rocker put Agbayani in position to score on Todd Pratt's sacrifice fly, but, again, Atlanta rallied to tie in the last of the tenth, with Ozzie Guillén singling home Andruw Jones off Armando Benítez to re-knot the game at 9–9.

Finally, in the 11th, the Mets' magic ran out. Kenny Rogers entered the game (although most had speculated that it would be rookie Octavio Dotel) and gave up a leadoff double to Gerald Williams. A Bret Boone sacrifice bunt moved Williams to third with one out. Following intentional walks to Chipper Jones and Brian Jordan, Rogers walked Andruw Jones on a 3–2 pitch to score Williams and win the pennant for Atlanta on a walk-off walk.

1999 NLCS (4–2): Atlanta Braves over New York Mets

Aftermath 
Mets' catcher, Mike Piazza struggles in the series were a major factor in the Braves victory.  Piazza batted a mere .167, going 4-for-24 with no extra-base hits.  The Braves took advantage of Piazza's limited defensive abilities, running relentlessly on the star backstop and stealing 14 bases in 18 attempts.  By contrast, the Braves were led by backup catcher, Eddie Pérez, who was filling in for injured starting catcher, Javy López.  Perez went 10-for-20 with 2 doubles, 2 homeruns, and 5 RBI.  Each of Perez's homeruns was a game-winning hit.  Perez also played a significant role in the crazy Game 6 win. He chased Al Leiter with a two-run single that capped Atlanta's five-run first inning. After the Mets took an 8-7 lead in the top of the eighth, Perez singled in the bottom half and was replaced by pinch-runner Otis Nixon. Nixon scored on Brian Hunter's game-tying single.  For his outstanding performance, Perez would be named the NLCS MVP.  

Moments after Game 6 went final, NBC color commentator Joe Morgan said, ""We've finally reached the closing night on the best Mets show since [their championship season of] 1986.""

The Braves advanced to the World Series appearing in their fifth World Series of the 1990s. Physically and emotionally spent following this series, they didn't put up much of a fight as they were swept by the other New York City team, the Yankees. The normally potent Braves offense batted just .200 against Yankee pitching.

This series would prove to be a harbinger of many events that would shape the 2000 baseball season. Rocker would go on to make several controversial remarks in a Sports Illustrated article. Jones would be heckled mercilessly by Mets fans, something that would continue until his retirement. Jones would earn the label of ""Met killer"" - 49 of Jones' 468 career dingers, third-most by a switch-hitter in baseball history — came at the expense of the Mets. The Braves would again win the NL East and relegate the Mets to the Wild Card in 2000. The Mets, however, ended up in the World Series, in which they fell to the Yankees. With the Braves being swept by the St. Louis Cardinals in the NLDS, it made the Mets' path to the World Series much easier.

The Atlanta Braves' dominance continued as they went on to capture an MLB record, 14 consecutive division titles.  Chipper Jones, Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine, John Smoltz, and manager Bobby Cox would all be inducted into the Hall of Fame, as would Mets' catcher, Mike Piazza and outfielder, Rickey Henderson.  

The Braves would not win another pennant until 2021 when they went on to win the World Series. One of the Braves coaches on that championship team was none other than the 1999 NLCS MVP, Eddie Perez.  The most recent pennant for the Mets was in 2015, but they still have not won a world championship since 1986.

History
For the first ten years Bradbury & Evans were printers, then added publishing in 1841 after they purchased Punch magazine. As printers they did work for Joseph Paxton, Edward Moxon and Chapman and Hall (publishers of Charles Dickens). Dickens left Chapman and Hall in 1844 and Bradbury and Evans became his new publisher. Bradbury and Evans published William Makepeace Thackeray's Vanity Fair in 1847 (as a serial), as well as most of his longer fiction. The firm operated from offices at no.11 Bouverie Street, no.85 Fleet Street, and no.4-14 Lombard Street, London (now Lombard Lane).

The inclusion of a monthly supplement, Household Narrative, in the weekly Household Words edited by Dickens was the occasion for a test case on newspaper taxation in 1851. Bradbury & Evans as publishers might have found themselves in the forefront of the ongoing campaign against ""taxes on knowledge""; but the initial court decision went in their favour. The government then tried amending the existing law, to duck public opinion, reversing the stand taken by the revenue on the definition of ""newspaper"".

After Bradbury & Evans broke with Dickens in 1859, they founded the illustrated literary magazine Once a Week, which competed with Dickens' new All The Year Round (the successor to Household Words). Among the artists who contributed illustrations to the firm's publications: John Leech and John Tenniel. In 1861 Evans' daughter, Bessie Evans, married Dickens' son, Charles Dickens, Jr. The founders' sons, William Hardwick Bradbury (1832–1892) and Frederick Moule Evans (1832–1902), continued the business, with the much needed financial backing of William Agnew and his brother Thomas.

Events
The key event in this period was the advent of World Series Cricket, which ran from 1977 to 1979.

Domestic cricket
Western Australia had a very strong team during this period when they won the Sheffield Shield seven times.

International tours of Australia

England 1970–71

Ray Illingworth captained the English cricket team in Australia in 1970–71, playing as England in the 1970–71 Ashes series against the Australians and as the MCC in their other matches on the tour. They had a successful tour, but an acrimonious one as Illingworth's team often argued with their own management and the Australian umpires. When they arrived the Australian selector Neil Harvey called them ""rubbish"". and others labelled them ""Dad's Army"" because of the seniority of the players, whose average age was over 30, but these experienced veterans beat the younger Australian team. They are the only touring team to play a full Test series in Australia without defeat.

New Zealand 1970–71
New Zealand took part in the V&G Knockout Cup, a limited overs competition for the Australian state teams.  New Zealand were defeated in the semi-final by Western Australia.

Rest of the World XI 1971–72

A Rest of the World cricket team captained by Gary Sobers toured Australia in the 1971–72 season and played a total of 16 matches.  The World XI played five matches against Australia but these were not ranked as Test matches.  The team played three limited overs internationals against Australia and the remaining games were first-class fixtures against each of the Australian state teams.

The World XI squad included Gary Sobers, Graeme Pollock, Clive Lloyd, Sunil Gavaskar, Zaheer Abbas, Tony Greig, Farokh Engineer, Intikhab Alam, Rohan Kanhai, Bob Taylor and Bishen Bedi

New Zealand 1973–74

The New Zealand national cricket team toured Australia in the 1973–74 season and played 3 Test matches.  Australia won the series 2–0 with one match drawn.

England 1974–75

The England cricket team toured Australia in the 1974–75 season to play a six-match Test series against Australia for The Ashes. The tour was organised by the Marylebone Cricket Club and matches outside the Tests were played under the MCC name. Australia won the series 4–1 and regained The Ashes.

West Indies 1975–76

The West Indies cricket team toured Australia in the 1975–76 season and played 6 Test matches against Australia. Australia won the series 5–1.

England 1976–77
England visited Australia in the 1976–77 season to take part in a Centenary Test at Melbourne Cricket Ground to celebrate 100 years of Test cricket. By an amazing coincidence, Australia won the match by 45 runs, which was the same result as the original Test a century earlier.

India 1977–78

The India national cricket team toured Australia in the 1977–78 season to play 5 Test matches. Australia won the test series 3–2.

England 1978–79

The England cricket team toured Australia in the 1978–79 season to play a six-match Test series against Australia for The Ashes. England won the series 5–1, thereby retaining The Ashes.

This series was often over shadowed by Kerry Packer's World Series Cricket which meant many players from both sides were absent, including Greg Chappell. Australia were more handicapped which opened the way for England and their captain Mike Brearley.

Pakistan 1978–79

The Pakistan national cricket team toured Australia in the 1978–79 season and played 2 Test matches against Australia. The series was drawn 1–1.

West Indies and England 1979–80
As part of the settlement between World Series Cricket and the Australian board, two series were hastily arranged in which Australia played three Tests against both England and the West Indies.  These series are seen by many as semi-official only: for example, The Ashes were not at stake.

Australia v West Indies

 [1st Test] at Brisbane Cricket Ground – match drawn
 [2nd Test] at Melbourne Cricket Ground – West Indies won by 10 wickets
 [3rd Test] at Adelaide Oval – West Indies won by 408 runs

New Zealand 1982–83

The New Zealand national cricket team toured Australia in the 1982–83 season and played a total of 21 matches, mostly One Day Internationals in the Benson & Hedges World Series Cup against Australia and England. New Zealand reached the finals of the competition but lost to Australia 2–0. A highlight of the finals series was a 21-ball half century from Lance Cairns at the Melbourne Cricket Ground containing 6 sixes. This was a world record for One Day Internationals at the time.

Sri Lanka 1982–83

The Sri Lanka national cricket team toured Australia in the 1982–83 season.  Although Sri Lanka had just acquired Test status, no Tests were played on this short tour which consisted of two first-class matches versus New South Wales and Tasmania; and a limited overs game versus Victoria.

Pakistan 1983–84

The Pakistan national cricket team toured Australia in the 1983–84 season and played 5 Test matches against Australia. Australia won the series 2–0.

England 1984–85
The England team made a short visit to Australia in February 1985 following a tour of India. The England team, captained by David Gower, played three limited overs matches in Australia: 
 14 Feb – versus Sydney Metropolitan at Village Green, Sydney
 19 Feb – versus Victoria at Eastern Oval, Ballarat (ListA match)
 28 Feb – versus New South Wales Second XI at Manly Oval, Sydney

West Indies 1984–85

The West Indies cricket team toured Australia in the 1984–85 season and played 5 Test matches against Australia.  West Indies won the series 3–1 with one match drawn. The West Indies won the first three Tests quite easily against a very weak Australian team. Then captain Kim Hughes lost the captaincy due to his and the Australian's poor form after the Second Test and Allan Border took over.  The Fourth Test at Melbourne ended West Indies' then world record of 11 consecutive Test wins as Australia held out for a draw.

The station is owned by Inyo Broadcast Holdings. WPXV-TV's studios are located on Nansemond Parkway in Suffolk, Virginia, adjacent to the transmitter tower it shares with ABC affiliate WVEC (channel 13).

History

WJCB
On August 9, 1985, Tidewater Christian Communications received the construction permit for a new channel 49 television station at Norfolk. Tidewater Christian, controlled by several Black ministers from Hampton Roads-area churches, set up shop in the former WVEC studios in Hampton and built WJCB. The station would broadcast religious programming and family-oriented secular shows. The first general manager was Dwight Green, son of Church of God in Christ bishop Samuel L. Green Jr.

Channel 49 signed on the air May 29, 1989. At the outset, WJCB was hampered by a weak signal, and local cable companies refused to add the new station to their lineups. It did not appear on some Hampton Roads systems until must-carry rules were reinstated in 1993.

In 1994, WJCB went through a management change, as stockholders successfully pushed for a court order to install a new board to manage the money-losing station. Under new management, WJCB added home shopping programming from ViaTV in 1994, in an attempt to boost its revenue. A year later, the station dropped ViaTV for programs from the new America One network and Infomall, an infomercial service owned by Paxson Communications Corporation; these aired alongside music videos and religious programs.

Lockwood Broadcasting purchased WJCB from Tidewater Christian Communications in 1996 for $6.75 million. Lockwood already owned a network of low-power TV stations headed by WPEN-LP. The company moved to spend $1.5 million on an improved transmitter for channel 49 and new studio facilities and to move the syndicated inventory of WPEN to the full-power station.

Lockwood had no intention of selling the newly purchased WJCB; however, Paxson presented it with an offer to buy the station for $14.75 million—more than twice what Lockwood had paid to purchase it from Tidewater Christian—and the sale to Paxson was announced in December.

WPXV-TV

Paxson Communications changed the WJCB call letters from WJCB to WPXV on March 2, 1998. Religious programming and infomercials as well as shopping programming continued to air on WPXV until August 31, when the station started airing Pax programming in the late afternoons and evenings with infomercials and religious programming during the day, with the launch of the then-new Pax network. WPXV aired rebroadcasts of WAVY-TV's 6 p.m. and 11 p.m. weeknight newscasts at 7 p.m. and 11:30 p.m. weeknights from 2003 to 2004 and had master control in WAVY's studios until 2004 when Paxson and NBC broke up the agreement.

Technical information

Subchannels
The station's digital signal is multiplexed:

The Worship Network was previously seen on WPXV-TV's fourth digital subchannel; however, Ion dropped The Worship Network on all Ion owned and operated stations on January 31, 2010, at midnight.

Analog-to-digital conversion
WPXV-TV discontinued regular programming on its analog signal, over UHF channel 49, on June 12, 2009, as part of the federally mandated transition from analog to digital television. The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 46, using PSIP to display WPXV-TV's virtual channel as 49 on digital television receivers.

Between 1994 and 2000 it was the default type of municipal government for small and rural communities. After apartheid these transitional councils were created as a provisional local representation until the formation of a more final municipal structure. Due to the implementation of a municipal system in 2000, all  except one  transitional councils were abolished and their areas were merged into new municipalities.

Background 
During apartheid, local government was split between different racial and cultural groups. The result was a very scattered governmental landscape at the local level. To induce the integration of these entities, the transitional councils were established. Therefore, the transitional councils were a composition of representatives of all existing local government bodies, including former black local authorities, former (white) local councils, boards of rural areas, committees for local affairs, regional service councils, joint service boards, joint-decision making bodies, joint local authorities, other official local authorities and persons, institutions or bodies with local government powers i.e. private towns and mining towns.

When the Local Government Transition Act with Election Regulations 209 of 1993 was approved by parliament, the act made provision for different types of transitional councils for local government: transitional metropolitan councils, transitional local councils for other urban areas, transitional rural councils and transitional representative councils. The act, however, was amended before the act was implemented. The foreseen transitional rural councils became transitional representative councils.

Administrative powers 
Transitional representative councils were the default type of local government for small and rural communities. Of all the transitional councils it had the least responsibilities. In contrast to the transitional metropolitan councils and the transitional local councils, the transitional representative councils were not directly responsible for service delivery. Within the area of transitional representative councils service delivery was a duty of the district councils (the former regional services councils).

Main powers and duties 
The main powers and duties of the transitional representative councils were:
 to elect from among its members person(s) to sit on the district council;
 to secure from the district council the best services possible for its area;
 to serve as a representative body for the area additional powers and duties as identified by the MEC, or as conferred, imposed, delegated or assigned, under any law.

Elections 

First, the representatives sitting in the transitional representative councils were representatives of existing local bodies. As in an indirect election system, a representative could be replaced after elections for these local bodies. Later, direct elections for the transitional councils were held during the South African municipal elections of 1995–96.

Abolition 
In the process to a new municipal structure, the transitional representative councils were the basis of the merger. During the process they were consulted by the Municipal Demarcation Board. In late 1999 it became clear what transitional representative councils - with their local bodies - would merge into one municipality. In all cases - except one - the provincial governments, the municipal demarcation board and the transitional representative councils could reach agreements about the merger into and the foundation of new municipalities. After these agreements the abolition of each transitional representative council was published in the provincial government gazettes. The abolition of the transitional representative councils effectively took place at 5 December 2000, during the South African municipal elections of 2000.

Orania  

In the case of the Afrikaner-town of Orania, the abolition of the Orania Transitional Representative Council never was published in the provincial government gazette of the Northern Cape. The Orania Transitional Representative Council did also object a proposed merger with Hopetown and Strydenburg. After the provincial government of the Northern Cape published a rectification in its government gazette, the Orania Transitional Representative Council went to court. This lawsuit was handled by the Northern Cape High Court on 4 December 2000, one day before the nationwide local elections. In the light of the mistake of the Northern Cape government to not publish the abolition of the Orania Transitional Representative Council it was very likely that Orania would win the case, with the possible result that the High Court could cancel the elections scheduled for the next day.

Therefore, the case was settled between Orania and the South African government. They agreed that the Orania Transitional Representative Council will remain in place indefinitely with all its powers, rights and duties until there is an agreement about the municipal status of Orania. This agreement was affirmed by the Northern Cape High Court that same day.

The hardcover edition includes 16 pages of black-and-white photos, front and back.

Interviews
Many friends and relatives of Belushi, including his widow Judith Belushi Pisano, Dan Aykroyd, and James Belushi, agreed to be interviewed at length for the book, but later felt the final product was exploitative and not representative of the John Belushi they knew. Pisano wrote her own book, Samurai Widow (1990), to counter the image of Belushi portrayed in Wired.

Reception
In 2013, Tanner Colby, who had co-authored the 2005 book Belushi: A Biography with Pisano, wrote about how Wired exposes Woodward's strengths and weaknesses as a journalist. While in the process of researching the anecdotes related in the book, he found that while many of them were true, Woodward missed, or didn't seek out, their meaning or context.

For example, in Woodward's telling, a ""lazy and undisciplined"" Belushi is guided through the scene on the cafeteria line in Animal House by director John Landis, yet other actors present for that scene recall how much of it was improvised by the actor in one single take. Blair Brown told Colby she was still angry about how Woodward ""tricked"" her in describing her and Belushi preparing for a love scene in Continental Divide. Colby notes that Woodward devotes a single paragraph to Belushi's grandmother's funeral, where he hit a low point and resolved to get clean for that film, while diligently documenting every instance of drug abuse he turned up. ""It's like someone wrote a biography of Michael Jordan in which all the stats and scores are correct, but you come away with the impression that Michael Jordan wasn't very good at playing basketball,"" he concluded.

Dan Aykroyd denounced Wired publicly. Interviewed on television by Bobbie Wygant for NBC 5 in 1984, Aykroyd responded to the question of whether Woodward had interviewed him before writing the book:

Film adaptation
The book was later adapted into a critically panned 1989 feature film also called Wired, in which Belushi was played by Michael Chiklis and Woodward was played by J.T. Walsh.

Noninfectious anterior uveitis is an inflammation of the anterior (front) part of the eye and is instigated by autoimmune or other noninfectious causes (noninfectious uveitis can also affect the posterior segments of the eye, and then is called posterior, pan or intermediate uveitis). The onset of noninfectious uveitis occurs in patients in their thirties, with up to 10% of cases diagnosed in children under the age of 16. The condition may persist as a chronic disease.

Noninfectious uveitis is the most common form of uveitis in developed countries. Approximately 30% of uveitis patients develop glaucoma as a result of the inflammation that occurs in uveitis, as a complication of steroid treatment or a combination of both.

Uveitis, as well as steroid treatment for uveitis, can cause an increased resistance to the flow of aqueous humour (the clear liquid suspended between the lens and the cornea) from the eye. This leads to an excess of fluid buildup, which exerts elevated pressure on the inside parts of the eye, or elevated intraocular pressure (IOP). Elevated intraocular pressure can in turn lead to optic nerve damage and glaucoma.

Based on epidemiological studies of uveitis, approximately 34-94/100,000 people will develop uveitic glaucoma (see Epidemiology section). Uveitic glaucoma patients are at significantly higher risk for visual field loss in the long term compared to patients who only have uveitis. Patients with uveitic glaucoma also experience a particularly high burden of care.

Signs and symptoms
Because uveitic glaucoma is a progressive stage of anterior non infectious uveitis, uveitic glaucoma involves signs and symptoms of both glaucoma and uveitis.

Patients with acute non infectious anterior uveitis may experience the following symptoms: pain, blurry vision, headache, photophobia (discomfort or pain due to light exposure), or the observance of haloes around lights.

An ophthalmologist may be able to observe the main sign of active noninfectious anterior uveitis, which is the presence of immune cells (anterior chamber cells, or ACCs) floating within the anterior segment of the eye (see ""Noninfectious anterior uveitis"" in Diagnosis section). The ophthalmologist also may observe peripheral anterior synechiae (PAS), or adhesions between the iris and trabecular meshwork, the tissue responsible for draining aqueous humour from the eye.

Patients with uveitis who also experience symptoms of glaucoma may have uveitic glaucoma.

In an eye with uveitic glaucoma, the following glaucoma signs may be observed: elevated intraocular pressure, scotomas in the field of vision, defects in the fiber layer of the retinal nerve, and/or excavation (a regional deformation or depression of the optic nerve). Pupillary blocks, or the obstruction of ""the flow of aqueous humor from the posterior chamber to the anterior chamber"" due to a ""functional block between the pupillary portion of the iris and the lens"" may also be detected. Finally, the ophthalmologist may observe peripheral anterior synechiae (PAS), or adhesions between the iris and trabecular meshwork.

The dual presence of glaucoma and uveitis symptoms points to a diagnosis of uveitic glaucoma.

Causes
Uveitic glaucoma is a progressive stage of anterior noninfectious uveitis. Patients diagnosed with anterior noninfectious uveitis may also develop glaucoma; in this case the condition is termed uveitic glaucoma. Uveitic glaucoma can arise from the inflammation that occurs in uveitis; from steroid treatment for uveitis; or a combination of both.

Uveitis inflammation 
The inflammatory response associated with uveitis may lead to glaucoma. Active anterior uveitis flare-ups may develop quickly; in these cases, the inflammation can damage the tissues in the front part of the eye. Anterior uveitis may also be chronic; in these cases, repeated inflammation can cause progressive, accumulating damage to the eye tissues.

In all cases — acute one-time episodes, recurrent chronic inflammation or acute-on-chronic inflammation — damage to the eye tissues can cause increased resistance to the outflow of aqueous humour from the eye, which then increases the pressure inside the eye. In some chronic uveitis cases, the pressure inside the eye waxes and wanes due to the uveitis flare-ups.

Elevated pressure inside the eye can lead to irreversible optic nerve damage and glaucoma.

Steroid treatment for uveitis 
Topical corticosteroids are the first-line treatment for an active flare-up of noninfectious anterior uveitis, and the only effective treatment available for active inflammation. However, steroid treatment for uveitis can lead to uveitic glaucoma. Corticosteroids increase the fluid pressure inside the eye by increasing resistance to the outflow of aqueous humour, which can cause optic nerve damage and glaucoma. Steroid treatment can therefore cause or worsen uveitic glaucoma.

Elevated pressure inside the eye typically develops 2 to 6 weeks after starting corticosteroid therapy, but can occur at any time during corticosteroid therapy and may continue for weeks after steroid use has been stopped. According to the Glaucoma Research Foundation, the risk of developing chronic steroid-induced glaucoma increases with every week of steroid use.

Around 90% of patients with open angle glaucoma experience a steroid response of elevated intraocular pressure following steroid treatment. Therefore, once uveitis patients have developed uveitic glaucoma, they should ideally avoid steroids wherever possible.

Combination of uveitis inflammation and steroid treatment 
In some cases, uveitis inflammation and steroid treatment both contribute to elevated pressure inside the eye, which leads to optic nerve damage and glaucoma.

Pathogenesis

Uveitic glaucoma as a result of recurring uveitic inflammation 
Uveitic glaucoma can develop as a complication of anterior uveitis resulting from the inflammatory response associated with the disease. The inflammatory response can be characterized by occlusion of the trabecular meshwork, or blocking of the tissue that is responsible for draining aqueous humour from the eye. Another characteristic that presents in some patients is peripheral anterior synechiae (PAS), or adhesions between the iris and trabecular meshwork. These two characteristics of the inflammatory uveitic response can lead to an increase in intraocular pressure, and consequently to irreversible optic nerve damage and glaucoma.

Noninfectious uveitis is characterized by an inflammatory process that may be acute, recurrent, chronic or acute-on-chronic. Uveitic glaucoma is associated with an aggressive disease course caused by very high levels of intraocular pressure that wax and wane. When uveitis is acute, the onset of inflammation is rapid, with obstruction of intertrabecular spaces. When uveitis is chronic, recurrent bouts lead to tissue destruction from direct inflammation. Obstruction of the intertrabecular spaces characteristic of acute onset uveitis, as well as the repeated inflammation characteristic to chronic uveitis, can lead to elevated intraocular pressure. This can consequently cause optic nerve damage and glaucoma.

Uveitic glaucoma as a response to steroid treatment of uveitis 
Uveitic glaucoma can also develop as a response to steroid treatment of uveitis. Corticosteroids cause a rise in the fluid pressure inside the eye. While the pathogenesis of corticosteroid-induced ocular hypertension is not fully understood, it likely involves swelling and remodeling (alterations to the extracellular matrix) of the trabecular meshwork, which leads to increased resistance to aqueous humour outflow and an increase in intraocular pressure. Another possible mechanism by which corticosteroids increase fluid pressure inside the eye is as follows:

 Corticosteroids inhibit (partly prevent and slow) the breakdown of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in the trabecular meshwork.
 GAGs accumulate in the meshwork.
 Fluid drainage is decreased.
 Fluid pressure in the eye is increased.

It has also been suggested that corticosteroids may be capable of modifying the trabecular meshwork cells, modulating their size as well as their cytoskeletal arrangement, which in turn could limit fluid drainage.

Diagnosis
Uveitic glaucoma is a progression stage of noninfectious acute anterior uveitis. In order to diagnose uveitic glaucoma, a dual diagnosis of non-infectious anterior uveitis and glaucoma is required. A thorough examination of the eye by an ophthalmologist is performed in order to diagnose uveitic glaucoma.

Noninfectious anterior uveitis 
[Main article: Uveitis]

The main diagnostic sign of noninfectious acute anterior uveitis is the presence of anterior chamber cells (ACCs), or immune cells, in the anterior, or front, chamber of the eye. The anterior chamber of healthy eyes does not contain any immune cells, hence the main indicator of noninfectious anterior uveitis is the presence of immune blood cells inside the anterior chamber of the eye. The more cells found floating in the anterior chamber, the more severe the uveitis.

The quantity of immune cells present in the anterior chamber can be determined via a slit lamp examination.

In 2005, an International Working Group on SUN (Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature) took steps towards standardizing the methods for reporting clinical data in the field of uveitis. One of their products was a grading scheme for anterior chamber cells.

In 2021, a new slit lamp–based ACC assessment method, TGIS (Tarsier Grading Image Scale), was developed. TGIS uses a visual analog scale to enable pattern recognition-based evaluation of ACC density during a uveitic flare-up. This is achieved by graphically representing a high-power field slit beam through the anterior chamber, from the cornea to the lens surface.

Another important clinical measurement of ocular inflammation is flare. Flare is the leakage of various proteins (such as fibrin and cytokines) into the ocular anterior chamber, as a manifestation of inflammation. It will usually have a ""milky"" appearance. Flare can also be observed via slit lamp examination.

Glaucoma 
[Main article: Glaucoma]

Glaucoma is a group of eye diseases that result in damage to the optic nerve (or retina) and cause vision loss.

Glaucoma is challenging to diagnose and relies on several different methods of assessment to determine the level of optic nerve damage. These may include tonometry, a procedure to determine pressure inside the eye; a visual field test, which assesses peripheral vision; and imaging tests of the optic nerve.

Treatment 
Treatment for uveitic glaucoma requires addressing the noninfectious anterior uveitis as well as the glaucoma present in uveitic glaucoma patients. Most urgently, the inflammation associated with uveitis must be identified and treated, to ensure as little damage to the eye as possible. Secondly, the elevated intraocular pressure associated with glaucoma must be treated. Steroid treatment may be discouraged because of the associated side effects.

Treatment of noninfectious anterior uveitis 
Topical corticosteroid eyedrops are first-line treatment for uveitis and represent the only approved topical treatment for active non-infectious anterior uveitis. They are the only effective treatment for the short term available today. Corticosteroids can also be administered via periocular injection or intravitreal (IVT) injection. In more severe cases, treatment may be administered systemically via oral or intravenous corticosteroids.

Other treatments, including systemic immunosuppressive agents — which require close monitoring — may be considered where corticosteroids are ineffective or if there are concerns regarding side effects. Immunosuppressive agents include T-cell inhibitors such as cyclosporine and tacrolimus; antimetabolites such as azathioprine, methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil, and leflunomide; alkylating agents such as cyclophosphamides and chlorambucil; and biological drugs such as adalimumab.

Most uveitis patients are treated with local steroids in the acute phase but may also need long-term treatment with lower-dose steroids as a preventive measure between flare-ups. This precaution is employed in order to minimize the use of topical corticosteroids, due to their severe ocular side effects.

Despite significant advances in therapeutics, the prevalence of blindness secondary to uveitis has not been reduced in the U.S. for the past 30 years.

Challenges related to steroid treatment of noninfectious anterior uveitis 
Steroid treatment for uveitis can lead to uveitic glaucoma. Corticosteroids increase the fluid pressure inside the eye (by increasing the resistance to the outflow of aqueous humour), which can cause optic nerve damage and glaucoma. Steroid treatment can therefore cause or worsen uveitic glaucoma.

Studies show that 40% to 50% of patients treated with the corticosteroid triamcinolone via intravitreal injection developed clinically significant ocular hypertension. Corticosteroid-induced ocular hypertension typically develops 2 to 6 weeks after starting therapy but can occur at any time during corticosteroid therapy and may persist for weeks after corticosteroids have been discontinued. According to the Glaucoma Research Foundation, ""every week of steroid use averaged over a lifetime leads to a 4% increased risk of chronic steroid[-induced] glaucoma"".

In addition, around 90% of patients with pre-existing open angle glaucoma develop an additional adverse response to steroid treatment.

Treatment of uveitic glaucoma 
Glaucoma medications, glaucoma surgery and steroids are the primary options for addressing uveitic glaucoma. Approximately 30% of uveitic glaucoma patients require surgical intervention due to insufficient intraocular pressure control while on maximum medicinal therapy.

Available surgical interventions to treat the glaucoma in uveitic glaucoma patients pose a high risk to the eye, with a lower success rate compared to glaucoma surgeries in non-uveitic eyes. Steroids for treating uveitic glaucoma patients also carry high risks.

Because of the risks inherent in steroid treatment and the ineffectiveness of surgical interventions for uveitic glaucoma, there is currently no approved treatment for uveitic patients who also have glaucoma.

A steroid-free medication for uveitis in uveitic glaucoma patients, formulated by Tarsier Pharma, is currently undergoing clinical trials [see Research section].

Challenges related to surgical treatment of uveitic glaucoma 
Uveitic glaucoma patients respond poorly to glaucoma surgery; surgery in uveitic glaucoma patients commonly has complications. These complications are caused by either the surgical wound healing improperly or unhealthy levels of pressure inside the eye.

Glaucoma surgery usually leads to increased levels of inflammation in the eyes. This is an undesirable consequence, especially in uveitis patients, who already have a high tendency to develop inflammation. Because of this, 80% of uveitis experts report that glaucoma surgeries for uveitic glaucoma patients are likely to fail. Surgery in an eye with uveitis is associated with a higher complication rate, and in some cases surgeries such as valve implantation are too complicated to perform.

Prognosis for  uveitic glaucoma patients 
About 30% of uveitis patients also develop uveitic glaucoma. Uveitic glaucoma patients are at significantly higher risk for visual field loss in the long term (>5 years) compared to patients who only have uveitis. A patient who only has glaucoma (without uveitis) will, on average, become blind in one eye within 20 years of glaucoma onset. This is especially devastating given that the majority of uveitic glaucoma patients are diagnosed with uveitis at a relatively young age (in their thirties). Thus developing glaucoma at a young age and the cumulative damage of uveitis flare-ups put these patients at high risk of losing their eyesight.

The burden of care for uveitis glaucoma patients is also higher than that of uveitis patients without glaucoma. On average, doctors report 60% more visits from uveitic glaucoma patients than non-glaucomatous uveitis patients. Doctor visits are 40% longer for patients with uveitic glaucoma than for uveitis patients without glaucoma.

Epidemiology 
According to epidemiological studies, the prevalence of uveitis is estimated at 115-316 occurrences in 100,000 people. About 30% of patients with non-infectious anterior uveitis also develop glaucoma. Accordingly, 34-94 people in every 100,000 patients with uveitis will develop glaucoma.

Research

Steroid-free medication for uveitis and uveitic glaucoma 
A steroid-free eyedrop medication for uveitis and uveitic glaucoma patients, TRS01, is undergoing clinical investigation (as of May 2022). TRS01 is intended as an anti-inflammatory medication for uveitis and uveitic glaucoma that is not anticipated to contribute to elevated intraocular pressure and glaucoma. Up to May 2022, two Phase I/II clinical trials testing TRS01 have been completed. Several dozen patients have undergone these trials. TRS01 is now being investigated in a Phase III clinical trial in patients with noninfectious anterior uveitis, including some with uveitic glaucoma.

With A.T. Hill and Aku Päiviö she was one of the key figures in the Finnish Canadian socialist movement of the early 1900s. Authorities considered Kannasto as one of the most dangerous agitators in Canada. She was also active in the Canadian suffragette movement.

Life
Kannasto was born in Ylihärmä, Grand Duchy of Finland. She emigrated to United States in 1899 and studied at the Suomi College in Hancock, Michigan. In 1905 Kannasto joined the Socialist Party of America working as a writer and speaker. Two years later she moved to Port Arthur, Ontario with her spouse J.V. Kannasto. Although Kannasto used the surname of her spouse, they were never married. Living together without marriage was a common habit among radical Finns in North America.

In 1908 Kannasto became the first paid organizer in the Finnish-Canadian socialist movement. Her job was to recruit Finnish workers to join the Socialist Party and later the Social Democratic Party. Kannasto helped establishing the Finnish Organization of Canada (FOC) in 1911. It was first associated with the Social Democratic Party and later with the Communist Party of Canada. In three years FOC had more than 3,000 members in 64 locals across the country, some 500 of them were women. Kannasto travelled across the country at least five times and made a large number of shorter journeys. She spoke to the Finns in the remote mining towns, rural areas, and lumber camps. Kannasto held also additional meetings for women guiding them on women's role in the labour movement and even discussed about more intimate issues such as marriage life and birth control. She was respected by both men and women as well as among English-speaking socialists, although she didn't speak much English.

Canadian authorities viewed Kannasto as one of the country's most dangerous agitators and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police wanted to deport her. They started to follow Kannasto and finally she was arrested in early 1920 on her way to Manyberries, Alberta. After her release Kannasto continued her work. She was later arrested at least once, in May 1925 in the United States while she was speaking in Hibbing, Minnesota. Kannasto was accused of illegal entry. She was forced to leave her political activities in the early 1930s due to the continuous harassment by the Canadian authorities. Kannasto died in Canada in 1968.

Film 
A Canadian-Finnish documentary drama Under the Red Star was released in 2011. It is a story about union organizers and Finnish refugees who fled to Canada after the 1918 Civil War. Sanna Kannasto is played by Finnish actress Elena Leeve.

Army cooperation planes combined the roles of artillery spotter aircraft, liaison, reconnaissance plane and close air support.

Details
The concept of army cooperation units was invented in France at the end of World War I. Numerous countries experimented with the idea of creating separate units tasked with close cooperation with ground units. However, in most cases the roles of observation, reconnaissance and liaison were kept separate, with each assigned to a more specialised unit. One of the few countries to actually implement the idea was Poland. By the end of the 1930s the Polish Army had 12 escadrilles of ""assisting aircraft"", usually operating as platoons of 3 to 6 aircraft attached to regiments of infantry or cavalry. Typical Polish army cooperation planes included Lublin R-XIII, PZL Ł.2 and RWD-14 Czapla. According to Polish specifications of the late 1920s, the army cooperation aircraft were capable of STOL, had folding wings and relatively small dimensions to allow them to operate from improvised airfields and improvised hangars such as barns. The folding wings also allowed for the plane to be towed by a car or truck, which was essential for the planes to operate in cooperation with the land units.

Gordon is the director of the Stockholm Resilience Centre and a professor at Stockholm University, Sweden.  She is also on the board of the EAT foundation, and often participates in public discussion of food and climate in Sweden.

Early life and education
Gordon, was born and raised in Stockholm, Sweden.  She was a high school exchange student in Northern Australia, and a university exchange student in Burkina Faso.  As an undergraduate she studied biology.  Her interest in further study in ecology was sparked by a lecture by Carl Folke on how people are connected to ecosystems, and this experience led her to contact him, and go on to study for a PhD with him at Stockholm University.

Gordon's PhD focussed on the role of water in the biosphere at local and planetary scales.
Her PhD was supervised by Carl Folke and Malin Falkenmark in Systems Ecology at Stockholm University.  Gordon spend part of her PhD in Canberra, Australia collaborating with Australian scientists at CSIRO.  The final paper from her thesis was the first assessment of how human land use change, especially deforestation and irrigation, had altered the flow of evaporative water into the atmosphere. Gordon's earned her PhD in 2003 in Natural Resources Management, Department of Systems Ecology, Stockholm University for her dissertation “Land Use, Freshwater Flows and Ecosystem Services in an Era of Global Change”. In 2004, her PhD was recognized Stiftelsen Kung Carl XVI Gustafs 50-års fond, an award for excellent PhDs.

Career and research
Following her PhD, Gordon was a postdoctoral fellow at the International Water Management Institute (IWMI)  in Colombo, Sri Lanka.  There she worked with David Molden on the Comprehensive Assessment of Water Management in Agriculture.  Following that she returned to Stockholm University where she worked as a researcher, in 2006 at the Department of Systems Ecology and then from 2007 at the Stockholm Resilience Centre.  She became an associate professor in 2012, and deputy director of the Stockholm Resilience Centre in 2013.  She has also been a visiting researcher at CIRAD in France, McGill University in Canada, and STIAS - the Stellenbosch Institute for Advanced Study in Stellenbosch, South Africa.

In 2018, Gordon became director of the Stockholm Resilience Centre. The Stockholm Resilience Centre is a partnership of Stockholm University and the Beijer Institute of Ecological Economics of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.  It is a large transdisciplinary sustainability research centre with about 150 staff, which has Masters and PhD programmes in sustainability science. In 2021, she was appointed the Curt Bergfors Professor in sustainable food systems.

Gordon's research has three main themes: research in Africa, water, and food. Gordon has had long term research engagement in Africa.  Over the past 15 years, she has conducted research in Burkina Faso, Tanzania, South Africa, Senegal, and Ghana.  Gordon's research on water has focussed on unravelling the critical roles of how evaporation of water impacts water flows.  With her PhD student Patrick Keys, she developed the concept of the precipitationshed.  From her work on agriculture, Gordon moved on to the ecology of the food system, and she has increasingly collaborated with chefs and food producers.  She is on the board of the EAT Foundation, and is one of the authors of the EAT-Lanet planetary health diet, which developed dietary guidelines that aim to provide healthy nutritious food to the world's people while limiting the damage of farming to the Earth's climate, nature, water.

Gordon's leadership on sustainable and healthy food was noted by the magazine Aktuell Hållbarhet, which considered her one of the 100 most powerful Swedish sustainability leaders, and she entered their top ten in 2021.

Notable publications
Gordon's most cited research has been on ecosystem services, food, and water.  Her work has been published across a wide variety of journals spanning topics from global change, to food, and agro-ecosystems.  Four of her most highly cited works are:

He became widely known for his work on Plato's Atlantis.

Education and early life

Rainer Walter Kühne was born in 1970 in Braunschweig, Germany. He got his diploma in physics from the University of Bonn in 1995 and the Dr. rer. nat. in 2001 from the University of Dortmund.

Research

Kühne worked on the subjects of cold fusion, cosmology, gravitation physics, and quantum field theory. His dissertation ""Thermodynamics of Heisenberg Chains Coupled to Phonons"" was on the subject of thermodynamics.

Kühne became widely known for his work on Plato's Atlantis. Kühne argued that the Atlantis story is philosophical fiction which includes historical elements. These historical elements include the Iron Age city of Tartessos and the war of the Bronze Age Sea Peoples. Kühne's theory is mainly based on the works of Adolf Schulten and Spyridon Marinatos.

A number of mass media reported on Kühne's Atlantis work. These include National Geographic, New Scientist, and BBC.

In 2006 and 2009 two archaeological and geological expeditions were performed in the Spanish Donana National Park in order to test Kühne's Atlantis-Tartessos theory. These expeditions were headed by archaeologist Sebastian Celestino Perez and historian Richard Freund. The geological results were published in three peer-reviewed journal papers. The archaeological results were published in Richard Freund's book ""Digging through History"". The National Geographic documentary ""Finding Atlantis"" (March 2011) reported about the 2009 expedition.

Main results of the two expeditions include evidence of four tsunamis between 2100 BC and 200 BC, numerous pottery sherds and geophysical evidence of an archaeological site.

The building serves as the flagship store of Cartier in New York City. It consists of two conjoined residences completed in 1905: the Morton F. Plant residence at 651–653 Fifth Avenue, designed by Robert W. Gibson, and the Edward Holbrook residence at 4 East 52nd Street, designed by C. P. H. Gilbert.

The Plant House was designed in the Neo-Renaissance style and has facades on both 52nd Street and Fifth Avenue. The 52nd Street facade of the house contains an ornate pavilion, and both facades have an attic hidden inside a frieze. The Edward Holbrook House was also designed in a neoclassical style but has a mansard roof. Both houses are five stories tall and are connected internally. The Cartier store takes up all of the stories inside the building.

The southeast corner of Fifth Avenue and 52nd Street was planned as a hotel in the early 1900s after the Roman Catholic Asylum vacated the site. After the Vanderbilts blocked the development of the hotel, the northern portion became the Morton F. Plant House, while the southern portion of the site was developed as the Marble Twins at 645 and 647 Fifth Avenue. In the late 1910s, Plant sold his house to Cartier. The Holbrook House was occupied by a variety of tenants until 1927, after which it was purchased by 653 Fifth Avenue's owners and used by various organizations and firms. The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission designated the Cartier Building as a city landmark in 1970, and it was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983 along with 647 Fifth Avenue.

Site
The Cartier Building is in the Midtown Manhattan neighborhood of New York City. It is along the southeast corner of Fifth Avenue to the west and 52nd Street to the north. The land lot is ""L""-shaped and covers , with a frontage of  on Fifth Avenue and a maximum depth of . The lot includes 651–653 Fifth Avenue, measuring 50 feet along Fifth Avenue and  on 52nd Street, and the adjacent 4 East 52nd Street to the east, measuring  on 52nd Street and  deep. The building is on the same block as 647 Fifth Avenue and the Olympic Tower to the south, as well as 11 East 51st Street and 488 Madison Avenue to the east. Other nearby buildings include 650 Fifth Avenue to the west, 660 Fifth Avenue to the northwest, Austrian Cultural Forum New York to the north, 12 East 53rd Street and Omni Berkshire Place to the northeast, St. Patrick's Cathedral to the south, and the International Building of Rockefeller Center to the southwest.

Fifth Avenue between 42nd Street and Central Park South (59th Street) was relatively undeveloped through the late 19th century. The surrounding area was once part of the common lands of the city of New York. The Commissioners' Plan of 1811 established Manhattan's street grid with lots measuring  deep and  wide. Upscale residences were constructed around Fifth Avenue following the American Civil War. In 1882, three Vanderbilt family residences were completed along Fifth Avenue between 51st and 59th Streets (the William H., William K., and Cornelius II mansions). The surrounding section of Fifth Avenue thus became known as ""Vanderbilt Row"". By the early 1900s, that section of Fifth Avenue was becoming a commercial area.

The site immediately north of St. Patrick's Cathedral was owned by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York, which used the site for the Roman Catholic Asylum. The asylum took up two blocks between 51st Street, 52nd Street, Fifth Avenue, and Park Avenue. It was once one of several public institutions on the midtown section of Fifth Avenue, but by the end of the 19th century, it was the only one remaining. The Roman Catholic Asylum site was placed for sale in 1899 after the institution had secured another site in the Bronx.

Architecture
The Cartier Building, the main New York City store of jeweler Cartier, consists of the Morton F. Plant House at 651–653 Fifth Avenue and the Edward Holbrook House at 4 East 52nd Street. The Plant House was designed by architect Robert W. Gibson in the Neo-Renaissance style for Morton Freeman Plant, a financier who was the son of railroad tycoon Henry B. Plant. The Holbrook House was designed by C. P. H. Gilbert for Edward Holbrook, who was president of the Gorham Manufacturing Company in the 1900s. The two houses comprise the Cartier Building and have been joined internally since the 1920s.

Facade

Morton F. Plant House 

The Morton F. Plant House at 651–653 Fifth Avenue has frontage on both 52nd Street and Fifth Avenue. The facade along Fifth Avenue is three bays wide and, at the ground floor, contains a large opening surrounded by blocks of rusticated limestone. The facade along 52nd Street also has a rusticated limestone facade and contains seven vertical bays, with an arched entrance in the center bay. The 52nd Street entrance was the original main entrance to the house, which was known initially as 2 East 52nd Street. The ground-story openings are square-headed, except for an arched opening at the center, which was the carriage entrance.

At the second and third stories on 52nd Street, the central three bays form a slightly projecting pavilion, with an ornate balustrade in front of the second-story windows. The center window on the second story of the pavilion has engaged columns, which support a curved pediment. The pavilion also contains four pilasters separating the windows on the second and third stories; the pilasters are fluted and contain Scamozzi capitals at their tops. The pilasters support a pediment at the fourth story.

On either side of the central pavilion, there are two windows on each of the second and third stories on 52nd Street, as well as three similarly designed windows on each story on Fifth Avenue. The second-story windows have individual balustrades at the bottom and are flanked by engaged columns that support lintels with denticulation. The center window on Fifth Avenue has a clock above it. The third-story windows are topped by denticulated lintels supported by brackets. On the fourth story, there are six windows on 52nd Street (three on each side of the pavilion) and five on Fifth Avenue. These windows are simpler in design and contain lintels above them. The fifth-story attic has a frieze within which are small window openings. A cornice with modillions, as well as a balustrade, runs above the attic. During the December holiday season, the facade of the mansion is wrapped with a large red ribbon.

Edward Holbrook House 

4 East 52nd Street comprises the Edward Holbrook House, which is internally joined to the Morton F. Plant House. This house is five stories tall and has a neoclassical design. The limestone facade is divided into three bays. At the lowest two stories, there are plate glass windows and the center bay is wider than the other two bays. There is a projecting marquee and a clock above the center bay of the first story, while the outer bays have light fixtures. The original entrance at the Edward Holbrook House was removed when Cartier moved into the building in the 1920s. The current entrance was installed in a 2000 renovation.

The third and fourth stories each contain three windows with molded surrounds. The third-story windows are topped by keystones, while a cornice with modillions, dentils, and brackets runs above the fourth story. The fifth story contains a mansard roof with a skylight and three stone dormers.

Features 
As designed, the Plant House was supposed to have a large dining room, drawing room, and smoking annex on the ground floor, as well as a library and music room on the second floor, connected by a circular grand staircase. The east side of the second story had Plant's piano room, which contained a coffered ceiling. The west side of the second story had Pierre C. Cartier's private offices.

After Cartier moved into the Plant House, it made some changes. The Cartier store occupied the first two stories of the Plant House while offices were placed on the upper floors. A second-story mezzanine, built in 1917 and demolished in 2001, had cabinet doors containing leather bindings on the edges. Following a 2016 renovation, the Cartier store was expanded to  on five floors, with an interior stairway connecting all the stories. The first floor was designed as an imitation of a residential mansion. The restored interior had a lacquered panel in the foyer, with representations of panthers in gold leaf, as well as oak paneling on the walls. The second floor contained salesrooms for fine jewelry. The third floor was designed to sell watches while the fourth floor was designed to sell perfume. In addition, a terrace facing Fifth Avenue was installed.

History 
In October 1899, the Roman Catholic Asylum sold much of the city block bounded clockwise from west by Fifth Avenue, 52nd Street, Madison Avenue, and 51st Street. The sale was valued at $2.5 million and included the lots on the east side of Fifth Avenue between 51st and 52nd Streets, as well as those on the side streets. George R. Sheldon and Charles T. Barney were reported as the purchasers. In the subsequent months, many of the lots along 51st and 52nd Streets were sold to families, though one lot was sold to the Union Club of the City of New York. The single-family lots were sold under the stipulation that they would remain in residential use for 25 years. By May 1900, only the lots along Fifth Avenue remained unsold.

Residential use

Construction
Edward Holbrook bought a  lot on the south side of 52nd Street, just east of Fifth Avenue, from Worthington Whitehouse in August 1900. That December, Holbrook bought the  lot immediately to the east from Lansdale Boardman. A group of developers led by Stewart H. Chisholm bought the southeast corner lot at 52nd Street and Fifth Avenue, measuring , from Flake & Dowling in early 1901. That October, Chisholm's syndicate filed plans for an 18-story apartment hotel, designed by William C. Hazlett, to be built on that site. To the east, Holbrook hired C. P. H. Gilbert to construct a 14-story apartment house adjacent to Chisholm's hotel on the 50-foot lot, along with a private house for Holbrook's use on the 30-foot lot.

In March 1902, after the corner site had been excavated, Chisholm sold the site to the New York Realty Corporation. The Real Estate Record and Guide described the sale as ""a peculiar transaction, and one which can hardly be called a sale"". The corporation was acting on behalf of the Vanderbilt family, which did not want to see a high-rise hotel development opposite their houses. The Vanderbilts sold the northern section of the plot, facing 52nd Street and measuring , to Morton F. Plant. However, they were unable to obtain a buyer for the southern section, which was in the middle of a city block. Holbrook canceled plans to build his apartment hotel in August 1902 after agreeing with the Vanderbilts to restrict their respective lots to private residential development. The following month, when George W. Vanderbilt announced plans for marble townhouses at 645 and 647 Fifth Avenue, the Vanderbilt family was confirmed to be associated with the New York Realty Corporation.

Holbrook did build a 5-story residence on the eastern site of the lot at 8 East 52nd Street, but he sold it to Ernest Kempton Adams. Gilbert designed a six-story residence for Holbrook on the western side of his 52nd Street lot, which would have been the site of the apartment hotel. In December 1902, Robert W. Gibson was announced as the architect for Morton Plant's residence. Gibson filed plans for Plant's house with the New York City Department of Buildings in May 1903; the plans called for a five-story limestone house to cost $300,000. Gilbert filed plans that November for Holbrook's house, which was to be a six-story limestone structure costing $95,000. Plant's residence at 651–653 Fifth Avenue was completed in 1905, and he and his wife Nellie moved into the house. The facade of the Holbrook House was finished by that April, and his house was finished the next year.

Occupancy 

When 4 East 52nd Street was completed, it was occupied by Edward Holbrook and his wife Frances. In January 1906, the Holbrook House hosted the wedding of their daughter Lilian to Count Guillaume de Balincourt. The Holbrooks sold the residence a year and a half later, in June 1907. The buyers of the 52nd Street house were initially not publicly revealed, but The New York Times announced the following month that tobacco businessman James Buchanan Duke had bought the house for $300,000. The Times reported that Duke was rumored to have been looking for a mansion on the Upper East Side. Duke had purchased a site on 78th Street by 1909, which would become his house. 4 East 52nd Street was then occupied by the family of real estate developer Harry James Luce, who had moved into the house by August 1910, when he received a mortgage on the property.

Immediately to the west, Fifth Avenue was widened in 1911, and the marble steps in front of Plant's house had to be cut back. Plant was forced to truncate his front areaway and fence. Around that time, the neighborhood was growing increasingly commercial. Plant's wife Nellie died in 1913 and the next year he remarried to Mae Cadwell. By 1916, Plant decided to move to a new mansion at Fifth Avenue and 86th Street. The new mansion was designed by Guy Lowell as an interpretation of an Italian Renaissance palazzo. The Luces retained their adjacent house for several more years; in 1922, The New York Times published a social bulletin announcing that Harry Luce's daughter was returning to the house after three years abroad. The Luce family continued to live at 4 East 52nd Street until about 1927.

Commercial use

Store conversion 
653 Fifth Avenue was resold to William Kissam Vanderbilt, who leased the house to Cartier in October 1916, thereby breaking his family's own restriction on the lot. At the time, Cartier's previous space at 712 Fifth Avenue was becoming too small for the company. The neighboring house at number 647 was sold to an art dealer the next month. According to the Real Estate Record and Guide, these sales marked ""another step in the transition of this section of Fifth avenue from the residential to the business stage"". In July 1917, Louis J. Cartier and Pierre C. Cartier decided to buy the Plant House outright. The trade consisted of $100 in cash and included a double-stranded necklace of 128 flawlessly matched natural pearls valued at the time at $1 million (equivalent to $ in ). Mae Plant had admired this necklace in the window of Cartier's 712 Fifth Avenue shop. Because of the later advent of cultured pearls causing the prices of pearls to plunge, the Cartier necklace was worth only $151,000 (equivalent to $ in ) after Mae Plant died in 1956.

William Welles Bosworth designed a conversion of the Plant House into a Cartier store. As part of the Plant House's conversion, the original front doorway in the middle of the facade on 52nd Street was removed. The Fifth Avenue Association granted its ""gold medal for altered buildings"" to Cartier in November 1917 for its alteration of the Plant House. Cartier hired Bosworth again in 1919 to make further alterations to the Plant residence.

1920s to 1950s 
The Cartier store was shared with Charvet & Fils, a gentlemen's haberdasher, until 1927. The store also hosted events such as a 1927 exhibition of old timepieces. Nicholas C. Partos took a 63-year lease on Luce's house in March 1927 and considered erecting a 12-story commercial structure on the site. Louis F. Mentz bought Luce's house that July, including a $200,000 mortgage on the property. The house was resold shortly afterward to the 653 Fifth Avenue Corporation, which owned the former Plant residence that Cartier occupied. It was likely around this time that the two houses were joined internally. In November 1928, an information bureau for the French government opened at 4 East 52nd Street.

4 East 52nd Street came to be occupied by the French Chamber of Commerce and the Alliance Française de New York, which respectively elected Pierre C. Cartier as their president in 1935 and 1938. The French Chamber of Commerce continued to occupy 4 East 52nd Street until at least 1945, when it hosted an exhibit of French craftsmanship. The houses at 653 Fifth Avenue and 4 East 52nd Street, along with the neighboring property at 647 Fifth Avenue, were all acquired in May 1950 by the Phoenix Mutual Life Insurance Company. The buyer, who reportedly paid for the buildings in cash, held the properties as an investment and continued leasing 653 Fifth Avenue to Cartier. In the late 1950s, design firm Design-Technics had a showroom at 4 East 52nd Street, though the firm moved out after 1959, when it leased another building on 53rd Street.

1960s to 1980s 
The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) designated the Cartier Building as a city landmark on February 5, 1967. Cartier officials threw a party at the Plaza Hotel to celebrate the designation. In designating the building as a landmark, the LPC assumed Cartier owned the building. Phoenix had never even been aware of the landmark status, let alone attended any hearing about it. Once Phoenix learned of the action, it asked the LPC to reconsider the landmark designation, as such a status prohibited major alterations to a building's facade without the LPC's permission. As a result, the landmark status was revoked in August 1967. LPC rules at the time prevented the agency from reconsidering the building as a landmark until 1970. The Cartier Building was re-designated as a city landmark on July 14, 1970.

In the late 1960s, Best & Co. purchased the development rights over the Cartier Building. This permitted Best's to erect a skyscraper above their store, which was two buildings south of Cartier's. Aristotle Onassis—the president of Olympic Airways, which at the time had a sales office at 647 Fifth Avenue—established a family trust called Victory Development in March 1970. Victory formed a joint venture with Arlen Realty & Development Corporation to acquire Best's store, 647 Fifth Avenue, and the Cartier Building. The Best & Co. store closed in late 1970 and it was demolished the next year to make way for the Olympic Tower. As part of the Olympic Tower's construction, a pedestrian plaza was built east of 647 Fifth Avenue and the Cartier Building. The tower was ultimately completed and dedicated in 1974.

A Ben Kahn fur salon opened at 4 East 52nd Street in November 1970; at the time, Ben Kahn and Cartier were both owned by the Kenton Corporation. Kenton sold Ben Kahn in 1972, and Cartier opened Les Must de Cartier, a watch boutique, inside 4 East 52nd Street in 1976. Cartier celebrated its 75th anniversary in early 1983 with a gala at the building, to which several LPC officials were invited. On September 8, 1983, the Cartier Building at 651–653 Fifth Avenue and 4 East 52nd Street was added to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), along with the adjacent building at 647 Fifth Avenue. The buildings were cited as examples of residences in Midtown Manhattan that were later converted to commercial use. The houses were added to the NRHP as a single listing, the ""Houses at 647, 651-53 Fifth Avenue and 4 East 52nd Street"". In 1987, Cartier asked the building's owner Olympic Tower Associates for permission to renovate the building's interior. Olympic originally declined, but a New York Supreme Court judge ruled in favor of Cartier in 1989.

1990s to present 

Butler Rogers Baskett was hired in 1998 to renovate the Cartier Building. Two years later, Cartier announced it would temporarily move to 711 Fifth Avenue while renovations were being conducted. The main entrance on Fifth Avenue was to be relocated from the northernmost bay to the southernmost bay, and a mezzanine over the showroom on Fifth Avenue would be eliminated. In addition, an entrance would be added on 52nd Street, where one of the original entrances had been removed, and window grilles facing Fifth Avenue would be duplicated on the 52nd Street facade. The architects for the renovation were Jean-Michel Wilmotte, Timothy P. Greer, and David Schwartz. Cartier president Alain Viot likened the restoration to ""a Cartier product that you redesign as it was before and make it contemporary at the same time"". A ribbon-cutting ceremony was hosted in August 2001, marking the building's reopening.

In May 2012, real estate investment firm Crown Acquisitions took a 49.9 percent stake in the Olympic Tower properties, which included 647 Fifth Avenue, the Cartier Building, the Olympic Tower itself, and a fourth building at 10 East 52nd Street. The Cartier Building received another renovation in 2014, designed by Beyer Blinder Belle in conjunction with Thierry W. Despont. During the renovation, the Cartier store was temporarily at the General Motors Building. The renovation was completed in 2016, two and a half years after it started. Guy Trebay of The New York Times described the 2010s renovation as having turned the Cartier Building into a ""thing of rational and distinctly Gallic beauty"". A writer quoted in Bloomberg News stated that the new interior was the ""single biggest signifier of wealth in Manhattan"".

) (born 31 July 1986) is a Thai singer, actor, and the winner of UBC Academy Fantasia season 2 in 2005.

Profile
Supanat ""Aof"" Chalermchaichareonkij was born at Chainat, Thailand. He is the third and the last son of the family who run one of the biggest construction material businesses in the province. He graduated with a master in Business Administration from Dhurakij Pundit University in Bangkok and hopes to return home to help the family run the family business.

Chalermchaichareonkij loves to sing since he was young and tried to participate in many singing contests. He won and failed from time to time until he was most successful in UBC Academy Fantasia Season 2, the most popular reality show in Thailand. Chalermchaichareonkij became the winner of UBC AF Season 2 with the highest popular vote from audience across the country. It was claimed that he won all hearts because of his friendly personality and his talents in Thai country (Luk Thung) songs, which he had just practiced one year before joining the contest. Apart from Luk Thung, Chalermchaichareonkij can also sing very well in other styles, pop, rock, hip-hop, etc. He is also well-known from the title Krarok Noi (Little Squirrel), which is named by his trainer from the show based on his personality.

After winning the reality show, Chalermchaichareonkij and all UBCAF II contestants released an album called Ray Khai Fun (Dream for Sale) with UBC Fantasia (Now called True Fantasia) in October 2005, following with his debut solo album Show Aof in March 2006. The album contains various styles of music including pop, hip-hop and Luk Thung, but the pop song called Plian Jai Noi Dai Mai (Could you change your mind?) climbed up to No. 1 in the SEED Chart Top 20 of 97.5 SEED F.M which is broadcast to all fans nationwide for three weeks as well as remaining No.1 in various national radio charts.

In October 2006, UBCAF I and UBCAF II contestants released an all-star album called Dream Team together and Chalermchaichareonkij can show his talent in Luk Thung songs again in the song Hua Jai Wang Wang (The Single Man's Heart), the only Luk Thung song in the album.

After the first solo album and the all-star album, Chalermchaichareonkij has realized that he would like to entertain his fans from all ages and he is most happy when he sings Luk Thung songs. Therefore, his second solo album appears to be pure Luk Thung songs instead of a combination of pop music and Luk Thung as in the first album. It is even more special because there are 4 Luk Thung super stars, including Arphaporn Nakhonsawan, Pornchita Na Songkhla, Pamela Bowden and Luk Nok Supaporn, to join and feature in this album. The song Rak Thon Rak Nan (Enduring Love, Lasting Love) featured by all four Luk Thung super stars, which is also the name of this album, went to no. 1 for six weeks in T-Top chart which is ranked by T-Channel, the most popular cable Luk Thung music station in Thailand. 500,000 copies of this album were sold and Chalermchaichareonkij was well-known among Luk Thung audience.

In December 2007, he was invited to join in a special show in Just the Two of Us, the most popular reality show on Hunan TV in China, to promote Luk Thung songs.

In 2009, Chalermchaichareonkij released another album ""Su Kho Sa Mo Sorn"" with Nim from True AF 5. This album recovered popular songs in the past and included only one new song ""Phu Chai Ngai Ngai"". Chalermchaichareonkij released an album ""Rue Doo Hang Kwam Rak"" again in early 2010 from a cooperation of True Fantasia and Sure Audio and another two singles ""Khad Kwan Aob Aun Yang Rang"" and ""Roy Yim Peun Nam Ta"" in late 2010 with other AF winners from Season 1–6.

Besides these albums, Chalermchaichareonkij also starred in drama series and movies. In October 2010, the contract with True Fantasia was expired and now Chalermchareonkij signed a 5-year contract with Grammy Gold.

The house was located approximately 1.5 miles north of the city of Lichfield.

First hall (1683-1806)

The original hall was built by Sir Michael Biddulph after his succession in 1683. This building replaced a smaller house on the site which had been occupied by his father Sir Theophilius Biddulph. The hall consisted of three storeys with a parapeted roof, seven bays wide, with three central bays projecting. Sir Michael Biddulph who was MP several times for Lichfield gained possession of the land after succeeding his father Theophilius Biddulph. The hall remained in the Biddulph family until 1765. In 1765 Elmhurst Hall and 370 acres of land (some of it in Kings Bromley) were sold to Samuel Swinfen of Swinfen in Weeford. Samuel died in 1770 and was succeeded in by his brother Thomas, who died in 1784 to be succeeded by his son John.

Francis Perceval Eliot, the army officer and later writer, moved to Elmhurst Hall as a tenant in 1790. In the same year he agreed to buy the Hall and the 352-acre estate from John Swinfen. Eliot also acquired the Stychbrook estate, the leasehold on Lea Grange and the leasehold of the land owned by the Vicars Choral of Lichfield Cathedral. Eliot eventually held 850 acres of land north of Lichfield, he borrowed heavily to buy the land and in 1797 he unsuccessfully put up the land for sale as he could not meet repayments. Eliot moved out to Lichfield and demolished the derelict hall in 1806 when it would not sell.

Second hall (1808-1921)

In 1808, John Smith of Fenton bought a large part of the estate, including the site of the Hall, from Eliot who moved back to London. Smith built a new Elmhurst Hall on his new estate. The new hall was built of brick with stone dressings in an Elizabethan style. The front was gabled with seven bays and an off-centre porch. The hall was approached from a long drive from Tewnalls Lane. In 1816, Smith became High Sheriff of Staffordshire. A small lodge was built on Tewnalls Lane in 1832. Smith lived at the hall until his death in 1840 when the hall was passed to his son, Charles. 

Charles Smith sold the hall in 1856 to Newton John Lane. Lane died in 1869. 

In 1874 his trustees sold the hall to George Fox (a retired Manchester businessman). During this time a lodge was built south of the hall, this lodge survives today and the building style matches that of the hall. In 1894 George Fox let the hall to the Duke of Sutherland so that he could entertain the Prince of Wales when he visited Lichfield for the centenary of the Staffordshire Yeomanry, which had been founded by Eliot in 1798. 

In 1895, the hall was sold to Henry Mitchell (the Smethwick Brewer). Mitchell lived in the house until his death in 1914. After Mitchell’s death, the executors of his estate put it up for sale and, after years without sale, the hall was demolished in 1921.

Today
In 1922 the estate was sold to a syndicate who split up the estate. The site of the demolished hall, the surviving farm buildings and 30 acres were sold to William Snelson, who set up Hall Farm, which survives today.

It serves as the third single from his third studio album, Perception, released on September 14, 2017. Available for digital download and streaming, it also includes an audio video.

The song is NF's highest-charting song to date, peaking at No. 12 on the Billboard Hot 100 and topping the Pop Songs chart. As well as reaching mainstream charts internationally, ""Let You Down"" charted on Billboards Hot Christian Songs and Hot Rhythmic Songs, reaching the No. 1 spot on the former chart. It is his first song to be certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America. It was later certified 3× platinum in the US, and also reached multi-platinum in several other countries, including Canada and Australia.

Song history
""Let You Down"" was produced by David Garcia and Tommee Profitt. NF wrote the song about his relationship with his father and how he did not want to disappoint him, making it the first time he had publicly spoken about his relationship with his father, who raised him as a child. His parents went through a divorce, and his mother overdosed years later.

Music video
The official music video was released on November 9, 2017, on NF's Vevo channel.

The music video was directed and produced by Nathan Feuerstein (NF's real name) and Patrick Tohill. Given the song's lyrical content, the visual focus is on the relationship between an older Nate and his younger self. The clip shows an older man, presumably his future self, standing on a dock looking at a lake, while a fully clothed NF drowns right in front of him. As he flails and tries to keep from going under, the man just looks at him, and doesn't help. Then, the same man is seen staring at NF who is trapped in a burning car. As it's engulfed in flames, the man again makes no move to help. Then we see the older man in a field, staring into a freshly dug grave. Inside the grave is a coffin, and NF is inside, dead. The older man seems upset by this, and falls to his knees. In the final shot, the older man is back on the dock, looking at NF drowning once again. The camera switches views to an identical tattoo that NF has. Then a woman approaches him on the dock and says, ""Nathan?""

Track listing

Chart performance
""Let You Down"" reached No. 1 on the Hot Christian Songs and Mainstream Top 40 charts. It also reached No. 12 on the US Billboard Hot 100, NF's first entry on the chart. The song achieved international success, charting in the UK, Australia, Belgium, Canada, Norway, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, New Zealand and Ireland.

The ""Radical Generation"" of the Liberal Party was made up of progressive young liberals. They were a kind of liberal left who hoped that through their criticisms the ruling Party could be persuaded to rectify its errors. The history of the Radical Party is, above all, the history of the newspaper campaigns inspired by Franz Tamayo Solares. In 1913 the workers engaged in bitter opposition to the liberal Federación Obrera de La Paz joined up with these young Radical politicians in rebellion against the President Ismael Montes Gamboa. This alliance resulted in the formation of the Radical Party, inspired by Franz Tamayo Solares, Felipe Segundo Guzmán and Tomás Manuel Elio.

In the Congressional election campaign of May 1916 the Radical Party proposed Tomás Manuel Elio and Franz Tamayo Solares as its candidates.

The Radicals were persistent in their efforts to portray themselves as the defenders of the workers. Felipe Segundo Guzmán claimed that the Party bears a resemblance to the socialist movement, sharing ideas aimed at protecting labour and defending it against the tyranny of capitalism.

Even at its peak the Radicals was never a major electoral force in the country. Lacking a strong popular base, political imagination and prominent personalities, the Partido Radical was incapable of really threatening Liberal predominance. The aggressive personality of Franz Tamayo, who originally entered parliament as a Liberal, was the Radical's only asset. The vacillations and its internal contradictions contributed to the eventual disappearance of the Radical Party. In their search for political ways of improving their socio-economic situation the workers turned not only to the Radicals but also to the new Republican Party, which had also broken away from the Liberals.

After the revolution of 1920 Radicals split into three factions. Franz Tamayo Solares and his followers dissolved into the Republican Party. Tomás Manuel Elio and his followers returned to the Liberal Party. A minor group continuing as the Radical Party. 
For the 1940 general elections Radicals allied with the conservative Concordance and elected the one deputy of the new National Congress (Claudio Zuazo).

After the revolution of 1943 the Radical Party disappeared.

Early life
Thomas Cheney, born about 1485, was the son of William Cheney (d.1487) of Shurland Hall near Eastchurch, in the Isle of Sheppey, Kent, Constable of Queenborough Castle and Sheriff of Kent in 1477, by his second wife, Margaret Young.

Thomas Cheney's father, William, was the eldest surviving of eight sons and a daughter, and at his death in 1487 his property in Kent was inherited by Francis Cheney (d.1512), his son and heir by his first marriage, but was in the possession of Francis Cheney's uncle, John Cheyne, Baron Cheyne until the latter's death without issue in 1499. Baron Cheyne's heir, his brother, Robert Cheney, died without issue in 1503, at which time Francis Cheney 'wrongfully took possession of their lands in Berkshire and Kent which should by an earlier settlement have passed to John, the son of a younger brother Roger'. Francis Cheney died without issue in January 1512, and Thomas Cheney succeeded to his father William's lands; however the other properties wrongfully acquired by Francis Cheney were awarded in 1515 to his cousin, John son of Roger Cheyne (d. 1499) of West Woodhay, Berkshire.

Career

Cheney was appointed Sheriff of Kent in 1515, and was Justice of the Peace for Kent from 1526 until his death.

He was a favourite of Henry VIII's mistress, Anne Boleyn, and she fought Cardinal Wolsey for his promotion in 1528 and 1529, although he later participated in bringing her down. However, it was not until 1535–40 that Cheney consolidated his authority as one of the most powerful men in the south-east of England. From Henry VIII's coming to the throne of England in 1509, Cheney served as Lord Warden, spanning the reigns of all five of the Tudor monarchs.  Cheney was present at the Field of the Cloth of Gold in 1520, and served three times as an ambassador to France, under the authority of Henry VIII and Charles V of France, between 1549 and 1553. He was Treasurer of the Household from early 1530, and he is recorded as being present at over half of the Privy Council meetings held between 1540 and 1543.

He represented Kent as a knight of the shire in every parliament from 1539 to 1558 with the single exception of the election in 1555.

Cheyne was among those councillors entrusted with the government of the realm during Somerset's Scottish campaign of 1547.<p>He was among those who sanctioned Gardiner's imprisonment in June 1548, and he was involved in the interrogation of Sir Thomas Seymour in 1549.

In 1550, he became a privy counsellor and owner of the Manor of Ospringe (in the parish of Faversham).

Cheyne opposed the plan to place Lady Jane Grey on the throne, and although he acquiesced with Northumberland's policy, he pledged his support for Mary I as soon as he felt it safe so to do. So fickle a courtier was he that the Marian Court privately distrusted his loyalty during the outbreak of a rebellion represented for Kent by his ""friend and neighbour"" Sir Thomas Wyatt in the attack on London in 1554, but the very fact that he sent men against Northumberland indicates something of his position. Cheney was initially distrusted by Mary, as she confessed to the imperial ambassador, his 'early show of support' proving shrewd as Cheney retained his position as Treasurer of the Household whilst other household officers were replaced.

As the Constable of Saltwood Castle (near Hythe), Queenborough Castle (in Sheppey),  Rochester Castle and Dover Castle, Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports and Lord Lieutenant of Kent (1551–3), Thomas Cheney was much 'involved with musters and coastal defence'. Sir Thomas Cheyne was appointed Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports on 17 May 1536 and appears to have been deprived of the office soon after Edward VI's accession, but was granted it back to him the following April.

Conspicuously in April 1545 Cheney suffered a bout of illness, and was temporarily replaced in his duties as the Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports by Sir Thomas Seymour, Hertford's brother. For the next four months Cheney delegated his responsibilities in the Cinque Ports and Kent to Seymour.

Cheney died on 16 December 1558 at the Tower of London, and was buried on 3 January 1559 in St Katherine's chapel of Minster Abbey on the Isle of Sheppey. He was survived by his son, Henry, and three daughters, Anne, Frances and Katherine. His will and the elaborate proceedings at his funeral were entirely consistent with the orthodox Catholicism of the period, showing him to have been conservative. In his will dated 6 December 1558, Cheney mentioned various properties which together gave him an annual rent of over £950, and after his death it was estimated that he maintained between 200 and 300 servants and retainers.

Marriages and issue
Cheney married firstly, by 1515, Frideswide Frowyk (died c. 1528), the daughter of Sir Thomas Frowyk, by whom he had a son and three daughters:

John Cheney, who predeceased his father
Anne Cheney (d. 1553), who married Sir John Perrot, Lord Deputy of Ireland
Frances Cheney (d. 1561), who married Nicholas Crispe (d. 1564)
Katherine Cheney (d. before 1550), who married Sir Thomas Kempe (d. 7 March 1591) of Olantigh in Wye, Kent, by whom she had three daughters, Margaret Kempe, who married William Cromer (d. 12 May 1598); Anne Kempe, who married Sir Thomas Shirley, and Alice Kempe, who married firstly Sir James Hales (d. 1589), grandson of Sir James Hales (d. 1554), and secondly Sir Richard Lee (d.1608), illegitimate half-brother of Queen Elizabeth's champion, Sir Henry Lee

According to Lennard, Anne, Frances and Katherine were all daughters of Cheney's first marriage:

Sir Henry Cheyne, knight, summoned in 1572 as Lord Cheyne of Toddington, died s.p. in 1587, having wasted his estate. His three half-sisters, daughters of the first marriage of his father Sir Thomas Cheyne of Sheppey, K.G., were his coheirs. Anne Cheyne, the third of these, was the first wife of Sir John Perrot, the lord deputy of Ireland, and mother of Sir Thomas Perrot his heir. Sir John Perrot, who was reckoned a bastard son of Henry VIII., died in 1592.

Cheney married secondly, by dispensation dated 24 May 1539, Anne Broughton (d. 16 May 1562), stepdaughter and ward of John Russell, 1st Earl of Bedford, and daughter of Sir John Broughton (d. 24 January 1518). of Toddington, Bedfordshire, by Anne Sapcote (d. 14 March 1559), and granddaughter of Sir Robert Broughton by his first wife, Katherine de Vere, said to have been the illegitimate daughter of John de Vere, 13th Earl of Oxford, by whom he had a son, Henry Cheyne, 1st Baron Cheyne of Toddington, and a daughter. There is a monument to Cheyney's second wife at Toddington.

Cheney also had an illegitimate son and daughter.

Based in San Francisco, Loverde worked with record producer Patrick Cowley on his greatest success; Die Hard Lover, released in 1982.

Early life
Loverde was born in Los Angeles, California in 1947. Frank had two brothers and two sisters. He was from a big Italian family. Born to Frances and Septemo Loverde. He was very close to his family, where music filled the rooms. In 1964, he appeared as a guest on American Bandstand in which he and 3 other panelists reviewed the Beatles single A Hard Day’s Night, and B side, I Should Have Known Better. But some time during the early 1970s he relocated to New York City to take a job as a DJ at the Yellow Fingers nightclub. Loverde continued working at this venue for four years, during this time becoming more interested in music production and playing the guitar. During the 1970s, Frank met Linda Imperial in St. Louis, Missouri while working as a guest DJ at a newly opened night club. In the late 1970s, Loverde re-located to San Francisco with partner Dan Straehorn (a dance choreographer).

Musical career
Working with Linda Imperial and her sister, Loverde made a name for himself on the San Francisco club scene as both a DJ and performer. During this time, the trio gained a record deal with Prism Records and released Iko-Iko, a record produced by Patrick Cowley and Michael Finden, in 1980. Loverde continued on the club circuit, occasionally working on studio projects, until 1982 when he was given an instrumental track by Patrick Cowley and asked to write lyrics for it. This track became ""Die Hard Lover"", which was recorded along with Linda Imperial and Peggy Gibbons. The trio, now calling themselves Loverde, had huge success with the single in 1982 and became celebrities in the Hi-NRG music community.

Loverde's second single was ""My World Is Empty Without You"", another successful release which led to television appearances and a tour. By the time of the single's release, Patrick Cowley was becoming increasingly ill, suffering from AIDS, and was unable to contribute anything more than simple synthesizer riffs. Production credits on the single went to Bill Motley and Horus Jack Tolson. Following Cowley's death in 1982, Loverde was unable to repeat its earlier success with new music produced without Cowley's input. They recorded Backstreet Romance in 1983, but the record was a commercial failure. Loverde's last works were ""Love Takes Me Higher"" and ""Manifestation of Love"", both released in 1987. After the collapse of Megatone Records in 1988, Loverde was unable to find a new contract.

Death
Sometime in the late 1980s, Frank Loverde contracted the AIDS virus. The illness had obliterated the music industry in San Francisco and many of Loverde's acquaintances had already died from the virus. He died just before Christmas on December 20, 1990 at the age of 43. His family had been with him during this heartbreaking time. ""He is now our Angel.""

The stadium is used primarily for association football matches.

History

Kim Il-sung Stadium was originally named the Girimri Stadium (기림리공설운동장) in 1926. This stadium held the annual Kyung-Pyong Football Match between Kyungsung FC and Pyongyang FC during the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s.

After the division of Korea, it was used as a venue for speeches by politicians. On 14 October 1945, it was the site of Kim Il-sung's victory speech after the liberation of Pyongyang, called ""Every Effort for the Building of a New Democratic Korea.""

Most of the stadium was destroyed during the 1950-1953 Korean War, mostly by U.S. aerial bombing of the capital city during those years. Rebuilt in 1969, it was then called Moranbong Stadium, but in April 1982 it was renovated and renamed in honour of Kim Il-sung. It is used mainly for football matches, and until the 1990s hosted the mass games  (now held in Rungnado May Day Stadium).

Present day
Today, the Kim Il-sung stadium is used as the home ground for the North Korea national football team, the North Korea women's national football team and the Pyongyang City Sports Club and Kigwancha Sports Club.

In 2008, on two occasions, a 2010 World Cup qualifying match between North and South Korea, due to be played in Pyongyang, had to be moved to Shanghai when authorities in the North refused to allow the South Korean national anthem to be played in Kim Il-sung Stadium, or the flag of South Korea to be flown, as North and South Korea have never granted each other formal diplomatic recognition.

The start and finish of the annual Pyongyang Marathon occurs at Kim Il-sung Stadium.

It consisted of the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia, as elected by the general election of May 9, 2017, and subsequent by-elections, and the Queen in right of British Columbia, represented by the lieutenant governor of British Columbia. It was the first parliament following the increase in size of the legislature from 85 to 87 seats. Immediately following the election, Christy Clark, the incumbent premier, asked the lieutenant governor to remain governing until the final votes were counted and it would be known if there would be a majority or minority government. Lieutenant Governor Judith Guichon agreed and Clark appointed a cabinet of 21 ministers and 13 parliamentary secretaries, which were sworn in on June 12, 2017.

Although the final vote confirmed that the British Columbia Liberal Party under Clark remained the largest party in the legislative assembly after the election, the British Columbia New Democratic Party under leader John Horgan and Green Party of British Columbia under Andrew Weaver combined had 44 seats (41 NDP and 3 Green) to the Liberals' 43. On May 29, 2017, the Greens announced they had agreed to a confidence and supply accord with the NDP which would allow the NDP to form a minority government.

Clark convened the Legislative Assembly on June 22, 2017, before losing a vote of confidence on June 29. As leader of the second-largest party, Horgan was then asked to serve as premier by the lieutenant governor and was sworn in along with his 22-member cabinet on July 18, 2017.

The minority parliament lasted for three and a half years despite the small combined NDP and Green working majority. The longevity of this one-seat working majority was made possible, in part, due to the expulsion of Abbotsford South MLA Darryl Plecas from the Liberal caucus after Plecas accepted his election as speaker of the legislature. The 41st Parliament ended on September 21, 2020, after Horgan requested the lieutenant governor dissolve the legislature and call a snap election for October 24, 2020, almost exactly one year ahead of the planned fixed date of October 16, 2021.

Party standings

Election and appointments
The members of the legislative assembly were elected in the 41st general election, held on May 9, 2017. The election returned 43 BC Liberals, 41 BC NDP members, and 3 BC Greens. As the leader of the largest party, Christy Clark was offered, by Lieutenant Governor Judith Guichon, the first opportunity to form a government, though the BC Green Party had announced they would support the BC NDP. Clark accepted and appointed 21 members to her Executive Council and 13 parliamentary secretaries. The cabinet was largely the same as the 40th Parliament, but with Sam Sullivan and Linda Reid, as well as newcomers Jordan Sturdy, Ellis Ross, and Jas Johal replacing ministers who had retired or were defeated in the election. This cabinet only served during the Parliament's first session in which it lost a confidence vote and Clark resigned as an MLA, triggering a by-election in the Kelowna West riding.

After the government lost a confidence vote, the Lieutenant Governor refused Premier Clark's request to call an election and offered the second largest party, the BC NDP, the opportunity to form a government. BC NDP leader John Horgan agreed and appointed an Executive Council of 22 members and 6 parliamentary secretaries, including Carole James as deputy premier and Minister of Finance, Adrian Dix as Minister of Health, David Eby as Attorney General, Rob Fleming as Minister of Education, and Michelle Mungall as Minister of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources.

First session
The first session of the 41st Parliament began on June 22, 2017, with the Speech from the Throne delivered by Lieutenant Governor Guichon on behalf of the Premier Clark and the BC Liberal government. Acknowledging the split results of the election, the speech included not only BC Liberal election promises but also some from the opposition parties, such as banning corporate and union political donations, a maximum donation limit for individuals, a referendum on electoral reform, repealing the referendum requirement for new TransLink revenue sources, eliminating tolls on the Port Mann Bridge, and raising the carbon tax to $50 a tonne. When the throne speech finally came to a vote on June 26, both the NDP and Green parties introduced and voted for a motion of no confidence, defeating the government. In the meantime, the government had attempted to introduce two bills (one that would have reduced the number of MLAs necessary to form an official party within the legislative assembly from 4 to 3, thereby allowing the BC Green Party to gain such status and another addressing corporate and union political donations) but both were refused first reading.

Second session
The second session began on September 8, 2017, and all bills were provided royal assent by November 30. On September 8, BC Liberal Darryl Plecas accepted the position of Speaker of the Legislative Assembly and a speech from the throne was delivered again by Lieutenant Governor Guichon, this time on behalf of Premier Horgan and the BC NDP government with the support of the Green Party. Plecas was expelled from the BC Liberal the following day as a consequence for accepting the Speaker position; Plecas subsequently sat as an Independent and enforced more civility in the legislative assembly.

Legislative amendments related to elections and governance, the Constitution Amendment Act, 2017 (Bill 5) reduced the number of MLAs necessary to form an official party within the legislative assembly from 4 to 2 and changed the fixed election date to October. The Electoral Reform Referendum 2018 Act (Bill 6) requires a referendum respecting a proportional representation voting system be held no later than November 30, 2018. The ban on corporate, union and foreign donations was implemented with the Election Amendment Act, 2017 (Bill 3) and Local Elections Campaign Financing Amendment Act, 2017 (Bill 15) which required all political contributions be made by a resident of British Columbia and sets new maximum donation limits, including limits to third party sponsors, and political spending limits, as well as public subsidies until the year 2022 for the political parties who achieved 5% of the vote in their electoral districts (e.g. the BC NDP, BC Liberal and BC Green parties). The Lobbyists Registration Amendment Act, 2017 (Bill 8) prohibited specified former public office holders (like former members of cabinet, deputy minister, chief executive officers, etc.) from lobbying activities for two years after leaving those positions.

Other bills that were adopted with support from all parties, included the Tenancy Statutes Amendment Act, 2017 (Bill 16) to limit the use of a vacate clause in fixed-term tenancy agreements, limit rent increases imposed at the renewal of fixed-term tenancy agreements to a specified amount (i.e. 2% plus inflation), and increase enforcement abilities against repeat and serious violators of tenancy laws; the Public Safety Statutes Amendment Act, 2017 (Bill 12) to create a system of e-Tickets for driving offences and e-Certificates of service, and validating the practice of impoundment of vehicles as a result of a roadside alcohol test; the Provincial Court Amendment Act, 2017 (Bill 11) to extend the term of judicial appointments from 10 years to 12; the Sheriff Amendment Act, 2017 (Bill 14) to enable sheriffs to collect personal information to a conduct threat or risk assessment; and the Pooled Registered Pension Plans Amendment Act, 2017 (Bill 13) to delete the requirement of print publication of new multilateral agreements.

Third session
The third session began on February 13, 2018, with a new speech from the throne. Ben Stewart joined the legislative assembly as a result of the February 14 by-election in Kelowna West to replace former-Premier Christy Clark. There were no changes to the Executive Council. The Budget Measures Implementation Act, 2018 amended the property transfer tax to cover bare trusts and exempt bankruptcy transactions while increasing the rate paid on the portion of a real estate transaction that is beyond $3million; created an additional school tax applicable to residential properties assessed above $3million; created the means for municipalities to issue ""revitalization school tax exemptions"" for newly constructed rental housing; made online accommodation platform subject to the Provincial Sales Tax and the hotel tax; eliminated the education tax credit and expanded the film incentive tax credit include to scriptwriting; exempted marine diesel fuel used in inter-jurisdictional cruise ships from the motor fuel tax; increased the PST rate payable on passenger vehicles priced over $125,000; increased the tax on tobacco, and made requirements for additional information regarding residency to claim homeowner grant and property tax deferrals for the purpose of better enforcement. The budget passed on a vote of 44 in favour, 41 opposed. Another budget bill, Bill 44, created – on a 44 to 38 vote – a new payroll tax, on payrolls over $500,000, to replace the Medical Services premium. In a 43 to 42 vote, Bill 51 was adopted to update and modernize the Environmental Assessment Act. In a 43 to 31 vote, the Insurance (Vehicle) Amendment Act, 2018 was passed to limit ICBC accident benefit coverage for minor injuries and to increase the maximum payable limit for other injuries, including adding new coverage for various health care services. Related to the ICBC reforms, Bill 22 expanded the jurisdiction of the Civil Resolution Tribunal to include certain ICBC claim disputes.

Legislative amendments related to housing included Bill 45, which created the Speculation and Vacancy Tax, applicable to unoccupied residential properties in Metro Vancouver, the Capital Regional District, parts of the Fraser Valley Regional District and several other municipalities. Bill 12 addressed ""renovictions"" by extending the mandatory notice of eviction from 2 to 4 months, legally giving evicted tenants the right of first refusal for the renovated unit, increasing compensation a landlord found guilty of a bad-faith eviction must pay from 2 to 12 months' rent, as well as increasing compensation evicted tenants of manufactured home parks receive from 12 months pad rental to a prescribed sum related to the cost of moving the dwelling. Bill 25 amended the Real Estate Development Marketing Act to address pre-sale condo flipping by requiring developer consent to such activity and making it subject to property transfer tax. Amendments affecting local governments were contained in Bill 18, which requires local governments to collect and report information on housing, such as the available housing stock, and Bill 23, which gives local governments the ability to require, under a zoning regulation, that rental be the only form of occupancy permitted in specified units of multifamily residential developments.

In preparation of the impending legalization of recreational cannabis by the federal government, the Cannabis Control and Licensing Act, the Cannabis Distribution Act, and the  Motor Vehicle Amendment Act, 2018, created a legal framework, including a minimum age of 19 for possession, the province acting as the sole wholesale distributor, sales being accommodated in either public or private retail stores, prohibition of smoking in all the same areas where tobacco smoking is prohibited as well as within vehicles, provisions to deal with drug-affected driving, and the establishment of a new provincial cannabis safety unit. Other legislation related to health included the creation of the Voluntary Blood Donations Act (Bill 29) to prohibit payment for blood donations, subject to certain exemptions; related to the opioid epidemic, the Pill Press and Related Equipment Control Act (Bill 27) to limit who can lawfully own a pill press and to allow for a registry of equipment to be maintained by the government; the Opioid Damages and Health Care Costs Recovery Act (Bill 38) to allow the provincial government to launch an aggregate action lawsuit against opioid manufacturers and wholesalers who misled the public concerning the addictive and harmful nature of opioids; and the Workers Compensation Act was amended to add a new mental disorder presumption for first responders and, at the request of the federal government, extended cancer presumptions to federally employed firefighters.

Without division, Bill 47 repealed the 37th Parliament's Health and Social Services Delivery Improvement Act and the Health Sector Partnerships Agreement Act which enabled contract-flipping in the healthcare sector, Bill 50 re-established the Human Rights Commission for British Columbia which had been abolished by the same Parliament, and Bill 41 repealed the 37th Parliament's Public Education Flexibility and Choice Act which had removed the BC Teachers' Federation ability to negotiate class size and composition, and had led to teacher strikes, but was mostly struck down by the Supreme Court of Canada. Bill 55 created provisions to allow all types of vehicle for hire companies to operate in British Columbia. The Public Interest Disclosure Act (Bill 28) was adopted to protect whistleblowers as recommended in the  Ombudsperson's Misfire report concerning the inappropriate employment terminations within the Ministry of Health – Bill 13 was also implemented a recommendation of the same report, in this case to allow for the Merit Commissioner to review the process used in any dismissal within the public service. Bill 26 amended the Child, Family and Community Service Act to provide indigenous communities with the opportunity for greater involvement in child welfare decisions and to create a right, that must be considered in decision-making, for an indigenous child to learn about the practice of the child's indigenous traditions, customs and language. Bill 34 renamed the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Targets Act to the Climate Change Accountability Act and replaced the 2020 emission reduction target of 33 percent with a 2030 reduction target of 40 percent below 2007 levels.

Other significant legislative amendments, adopted with all party support, included the Employment Standards Amendment Act, 2018, which created a job-protected leave of absence that parents of a child who has gone missing can take (52 weeks unpaid leave) and extended the leave of absence parents of a child who has died can take from 3 days to 104 weeks, as well as amendments in response to expansions of compassionate care, maternity and parental benefits by the federal government. The Temporary Foreign Worker Protection Act (Bill 48) created a licensing program for recruiters and employers of foreign worker and allows for the recovery of unauthorized fees charged by recruiters. Bill 11 modernized the province's International Commercial Arbitration Act by bringing it in line with guidelines of the UN Commission on International Trade Law and Bill 21 brought the province's legislation concerning opting in or out of class action lawsuits into line with the Uniform Law Conference of Canada's guidelines.

Fourth session
The fourth session began on February 12, 2019, with a new speech from the throne. There were no changes to the Executive Council. Sheila Malcolmson joined the legislative assembly as a result of the January 30 by-election in the Nanaimo electoral district to replace Leonard Krog, who resigned to run for Mayor of Nanaimo. BC Liberal Ben Stewart sat as an independent for the two month he was being investigated for an irregular political contribution.

New legislation, adopted with all-party support, included the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Act (Bill 41) to implement the UNDRIP, the Protection of Public Participation Act (Bill 2) to address strategic lawsuits against public participation; the Ticket Sales Act (Bill 27) to ban the use of automated ticket-purchasing software, mandate secondary ticket sellers disclose the additional fees added to the original price, and provide refunds for cancelled events or unusable (e.g. counterfeit) tickets; the Zero-Emission Vehicles Act (Bill 28), to create a framework with targets for increasing the proportion of new zero-emission light-duty motor vehicles that are sold or leased in BC; and the Fuel Price Transparency Act (Bill 42), to require businesses involved in the transporting, marketing and supplying of gasoline and diesel to provide data to the BC Utilities Commission on how fuel prices are set.

Other significant legislative amendments included Bill 7, which amended the Business Practices and Consumer Protection Act to separately regulate ""High-Cost Credit Products"" and lower their maximum fees; Bill 4, which amended the Interpretation Act to allow for the ending of daylight saving time; and Bill 14, which created a duty to report discoveries of sites or objects with potential heritage value. Addressing employment and labour standards, Bill 8 raised the minimum work age from 12 to 14, prohibited employers from withholding or deducting tips from wages, and created a new allowance of unpaid leave for victims of domestic violence or critical illness, while Bill 30 removed teachers from the list of essential services and further addressed contract-flipping by extending protections to re-tendered service (janitorial, security, transportation, health) contracts. Both on a 44 to 38 vote, Bill 15 amended the administrative procedures of the Agricultural Land Commission and Bill 22 amended the Forest Act to require ministerial approval for companies to transfer a timber licence and to require public interest be considered in the disposition of forestry agreements. Based on the government's comprehensive review of BC Hydro, Bill 19 amended several acts to, among other things, reinstate the BC Utilities Commission's authority to review BC Hydro's electricity supply and demand forecasting (Integrated Resource Plan), disapply the Utilities Commission Act from Powerex, and require BC Utilities Commission approval of new purchase agreements with independent power producers and feed-in tariffs. Based on the coastal ferry services review, Bill 25 amended the Coastal Ferry Act to add that the BC Ferry Authority must consider the public's interest in safe, reliable and affordable service in addition to the other factors.

Fifth session
The fifth session began on February 11, 2020, with a new speech from the throne. The legislature convened until March 5 before entering a recess which was interrupted by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the province. It reconvened for one day, March 23, with 10 MLAs in attendance, when they adopted a $5-billion aid package and amendments to the Employment Standards Act to create an unpaid ""COVID-19-related leave"". The legislature re-convened in July and August. Additional COVID-19-related legislation included Bills 18 and 19 which postponed penalties for non-payment of several taxes, created a $1,000 supplement to the Canada Emergency Response Benefit, and allowed provincial budget deficits for the next 3 years. Legislative amendments arising from the 2020 budget (Bill 4) included the creation of a new top tax bracket that starts at $220,000, exempting electric aircraft from PST, three year extensions of the farmers' food donation tax credit and BC training tax credit, removing the PST exemptions that had applied to soda beverages and online streaming services, and making heated tobacco products subject to the Tobacco Tax Act.

Other legislation adopted included Bill 2 to, among other things, allow ICBC to require training courses as a pre-licensing requirement for certain classes of licenses; Bill 5 to amend the fourth session's creation of a 10-day unpaid leave regarding domestic violence to instead be 5 paid and 5 unpaid days for workers claiming to be experiencing domestic or sexual violence; Bill 8 to allow school boards to operate a before and after-school child care programs; Bill 9 as the government's response to Crowder v. British Columbia (Attorney General) regarding the role of expert witnesses in a vehicle injury lawsuits; and Bill 11 moving ICBC to moves a system of no-fault insurance. The fifth session ended on September 21, 2020, after Premier Horgan called a snap election for October 24, therefore dissolving the 41st Parliament. The Parliament was ended nearly one year ahead of the fixed date of October 16, 2021.

Even a sampling from his extensive filmography attests to his versatility as a supporting actor and his reliability as a bit player. His roles are at times credited, but more often they are uncredited, consisting of peripheral characters who have limited dialogue or appear briefly in a wide range of occupations such as newspaper reporters, hotel clerks and bellhops, taxi drivers, salesmen, police officers, military personnel, waiters, and bartenders.

Early life and stage work
Harry Lester Dorr was born in Massachusetts in 1893, the oldest of 11 children of Mary E. (née McGinnis) and Edward Peter Dorr. Documents in Cambridge record that Dorr was born there, but his parents soon moved to the nearby town of Lynn, where his father worked as a shoemaker or ""laster"". By 1900, the growing Dorr family moved from Lynn into Boston. Little more is known about Lester's early life until 1917, when the United States entered World War I and Dorr registered for the military draft. He was living then in Chicago, and on his registration papers he identified his occupation as ""Theatre Producer"", indicating that he was already involved in or was pursuing a career in entertainment by that time. Dorr's identification of himself, however, as a producer might be attributed to youthful exaggeration or was an unrealized intention, for no subsequent references have been found that credit him or even mention him in that behind-the-scenes occupation during his career.

Dorr married in 1920 and during the late 1920s—before moving to California to act in films—he worked in stage productions in New York, including in Broadway dramas and musicals. He performed, for example, assorted roles in the 1927 revue Rufus LeMaire's Affairs; and the following year he portrayed Captain DeJean in the operetta The New Moon, which premiered at the Imperial Theatre in Manhattan on September 19, 1928.

Films
The federal census of 1930 documents that Dorr was in Los Angeles by April that year, working there as an ""actor/motion pictures"" and residing in a rental house with his wife and mother-in-law. He soon was cast in two Hollywood comedy shorts, both released by Pathé Exchange (RKO) in 1930: All Stuck Up and Ride 'em Cowboy. For the remainder of the 1930s, Dorr demonstrated his abilities at portraying an array of characters, such as hotel clerks, police officers, reporters, office workers, elevator operators, salesmen, bank employees, cowboys, mob henchmen, prisoners, truck drivers, train crewmen, soldiers, sailors, and hospital personnel. He was cast, often under contract as a ""day player"", in more than 250 films in just the 1930s alone, remarkably averaging a different role in a different film every two weeks for ten straight years. A very small sampling of those motion pictures include Riders of the Purple Sage, Union Depot, Central Airport, Helldorado, The Mighty Barnum, Murder in the Clouds, The Case of the Missing Man, Show Them No Mercy!, She Gets Her Man, Love Before Breakfast, Sinner Take All, Snowed Under, The Firefly, Expensive Husbands, Big City, Criminals of the Air, Dangerous Holiday, It's All Yours, Captains Courageous, Missing Witnesses, Pardon Our Nerve, The Cisco Kid and the Lady, Test Pilot, Penitentiary, The Main Event, The Crowd Roars, Coast Guard, Sued for Libel,  Gone with the Wind, and Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. He also performed in several installments of the 1939 serial Mandrake the Magician, portraying Gray, one of many criminals battling the title character.

Dorr continued to appear regularly in studio productions throughout the 1940s, but with reduced frequency when compared to the preceding decade; nevertheless, he still added more than 140 Hollywood films to his résumé in that decade. His work on the ""big screen"" decreased even further in the 1950s as acting opportunities increased on television. He was, though, cast in at least 45 feature films and shorts during the 1950s, including small roles in some notable productions, such as Ace in the Hole, The Greatest Show in Earth, and East of Eden. In another, far more modest film-noir production from that period, Quicksand, Dorr portrays ""Baldy"", a smooth-talking jeweler. His on-screen sales pitch in that role, in which he convinces the story's leading character Dan (Mickey Rooney) to buy a wristwatch, is typical of the concise, quick-study performances that defined Dorr's career and made him so popular in cost-conscious studio casting offices. Dorr's film work, however, began to draw to a close by the 1960s, when he served in bit parts in only five films. Then, in 1975, he appeared in his final role, playing a doorman in the musical romantic comedy At Long Last Love.

Television
By the late 1940s and early 1950s, programming in the rapidly expanding medium of television attracted the talents of many experienced personnel in the film industry, including Dorr. His earliest work on television was in two 1951 episodes of the televised crime drama Boston Blackie, starring Kent Taylor. Dorr's supporting role as Tommy in an episode of that series titled ""Blind Beggar"" is formally credited, although his other role in ""Oil Field Murder"" is uncredited. As with his film career, Dorr's 15 years of being cast in television series consisted predominantly of brief appearances on screen and portraying characters who had relatively few lines. Yet, his characterizations on television, like in films, were highly diverse and can be seen in at least 84 episodes of Westerns, crime and detective series, courtroom and hospital dramas, adventure programs, and sitcoms of the period. 

Examples of Dorr's television appearances can be viewed today in video copies of full episodes from classic series, as well as clips from related productions that are available online. Among those are his performances on Bat Masterson in 1960 (as a murdered Land Office Clerk in ""Six Feet of Gold""), and on The Jack Benny Program in 1961. In a sketch in an episode titled ""Main Street Shelter"", he plays a weathered, finicky ""patron"" of a homeless shelter who complains that the facility has only doughnuts as free snacks and stresses his preference for cinnamon buns and crullers. Five years after that appearance on The Jack Benny Program and subsequent work on several other series, Dorr made his last television performance on the sitcom Green Acres in ""I Didn't Raise My Pig to Be a Soldier"". He has a considerable speaking part in that episode as ""Mr. Collins"", a local draft board official.

Personal life and death
Dorr was married to Grace L. Painter, a native of Louisiana, Missouri. They were wed in Lucas, Ohio, on June 28, 1920 and remained together for 60 years, until Lester's death in Los Angeles in 1980. His remains were cremated, and his ashes were scattered at sea.

Selected filmography
As noted in his career profile, Dorr performed in hundreds of productions on stage, in films, and on television. The following is a sampling from a list of his screen appearances that is available in the catalog of the American Film Institute (AFI) in Los Angeles.

The InStep Series are composite racing singles designed with   
Levator's innovation: the ergonomic InStep system that increases   
stability and reduces the amount of tuck required to get in and out  
of the shell. Levator Boatworks successfully developed the INstep 
system in 1996.  This award-winning innovation changes  the
cockpit design by lowering the centre portion of the seat deck to   
the keel to lower the center of gravity of the rower stepping into   
the boat. The INstep project was a collaboration between Levator and 
the University of Waterloo-Faculty of Architecture.

The Mahogany Series are  advanced hybrid  wooden shells, which combine 
modern  carbon/kevlar/ with mahogany veneers. Levator Boatworks is one 
of the remaining commercial wooden rowing shell manufacturers 
remaining in the world.

In 2007, the Levator Boatworks moved production facilities to   
Dorchester, Ontario, east of London.

It is set in Washington, DC and focuses on homicide detective Gus Ramone, and ex-cops Dan ""Doc"" Holiday and TC Cook as they investigate the possible return of a serial killer.

The book was a finalist for the Los Angeles Times Book Prize for Mystery/Thriller.

Plot introduction
Set in the 1980s, a trio of murders is linked to a single suspect. All three victims have palindromic first names and are found shot through the head in community gardens. The media dubs the crimes the ""palindrome murders"". TC Cook was the lead investigator at the time, and two young officers, Gus Ramone and Doc Holiday, were with him at the third crime scene. 20 years later Cook is retired, and Holiday has left the police force. Ramone is a veteran homicide detective and becomes involved in a case which has all the hallmarks of a palindrome murder. Also realizing the similarities, the others are again drawn into the investigation.

Explanation of the novel's title
The perpetrator of the palindrome murders was nicknamed ""The Night Gardener"" by detectives.

Characters

Gus Ramone is a veteran of the homicide unit and a family man married to Regina, with two children, Diego and Alana. Gus is Italian-American while Regina is African-American. Regina works as a teacher, but when she met Gus she was a police officer. Diego's friends include Shaka Brown, Ronald and Richard Spriggs, and Asa Johnson. Their neighbours include Marita Bryant, and Asa's parents Terrance and Helena Johnson. Diego has recently changed schools and is often in trouble for minor infractions with the assistant principal Mr. Guy and principal Ms Brewster. His old principal, Ms. Cynthia Best, and teachers, Robert Bolton and Andrea Cummings, continue to work with his friends.

TC Cook is a retired homicide detective, lives alone, and is recovering from a stroke. He remains obsessed with the palindrome murders and his primary suspect Reginald Wilson.

Dan ""Doc"" Holiday is a bachelor, and since leaving the police has started a chauffeur and security firm. He left the police force under the cloud of impending morals charges being investigated by Ramone. Holiday is a regular at Leo Vazoulis' bar, and his drinking associates include salesman Jerry Fink, freelance writer Bradley West, and residential contractor Bob Bonano. Doc remains friends with officer James Ramirez.

Rhonda Willis, Ramone's partner, is a single mother and devout Christian.

The homicide squad includes detectives Paul ""Bo"" Green, Anthony Antonelli, Mike Bakalis, Eugene Hornsby, George Loomis, and Bill ""Garloo"" Wilkins. They work with Assistant U.S. Attorneys Margaret Healy and Ira Littleton. The squad is also working on the murder of Jacqueline Taylor; their main suspect is Tyree Williams. Rhonda is the primary on the murder of Jamal White. Her investigation includes his friend Leon Mayo, his girlfriend Darcia Johnson, and her roommate Shaylene Vaughn. Shaylene and Darcia work for a pimp called Dominique Lyons.

Crooks: Conrad Gaskins and Romeo Brock are stick-up men who make their living robbing drug dealers. Gaskins is a parolee and is dubious about his lifestyle. Brock is young, arrogant, and motivated entirely by the prospect of building his reputation. They use drug addict Ivan ""Fishhead"" Lewis for information. Fishhead is also a confidential informant for corrupt police officer Grady Dunne. Brock and Gaskins' next target is drug dealer Tommy Broadus. Broadus' girlfriend is named Chantel Richards. Broadus is supplied clandestinely by kingpin Raymond Benjamin. He uses drug mule Edward Reese to bring Broadus his supply. Reese is the son of Benjamin's sister, Raynella. Benjamin also employs enforcers Michael ""Mikey"" Tate and Ernest ""Nesto"" Henderson.

Plot

The novel opens in 1985 at the scene of the discovery of a third victim of the ""Night Gardener"" so called by the homicide investigators, and establishes Cook as the lead investigator with Ramone and Holiday as rookies. All three victims of the killer were found in community gardens, shot in the head after being similarly assaulted.

Twenty years later Holiday has left the force and Ramone has become a homicide detective. Ramone is working with his squad on the murder of Jacqueline Taylor. They manage to arrest and extract a confession from her boyfriend Tyree Williams which is backed by physical evidence. At home Ramone enjoys a happy family life and tries to mentor his son through the prejudices of his new school.

Holiday now works as a chauffeur, drinks in a bar and is unmotivated. One night after cruising, drinking and getting lost, Holiday falls asleep in his car near a community garden. He witnesses some events before sleeping again and awakes to find the body of Asa Johnson with a gunshot wound to the temple. Holiday makes an anonymous call to the police.

Bill ""Garloo"" Wilkins is the primary investigator on the Johnson case. Ramone becomes involved because of the boy's friendship with his son. He begins to notice similarities to the palindrome murders but says nothing. The Johnson family pressures Ramone to find a suspect. Evidence and the autopsy show a link with the palindrome murders. Wilkins uncovers evidence that Johnson was homosexual on his home computer. Ramone recognises Holiday's voice on the tape of the anonymous call and tracks him down.

Holiday also realises the similarity to the palindrome murders and contacts Cook. Now retired and afflicted by a small stroke, Cook continues to trail the early suspect Reginald Wilson. Wilson went to prison shortly after the last murder in the 80s and Cook still believes Wilson is the ""Night Gardener"". He is invigorated by the possibility of another chance to prove his theory and eagerly joins Holiday in an unofficial investigation.

Ramone arranges to meet with Cook and Holiday. Holiday is truthful about everything he saw on the night of Johnson's death and Cook tells Ramone about his suspicions over Wilson but it turns out that Wilson has an alibi for the night in question.

The night after the Johnson killing Ramone's partner, Rhonda Willis becomes the primary investigator on a new case, the murder of Jamal White. They find that the same gun was used in the deaths of White and Johnson. Through a tangled chain of connections detectives trace and arrest Aldan ""Beano"" Tinsley who, under pressure, confesses to finding the gun when walking through the gardens - after Asa Johnson shot himself.

Remembering the number of the patrol car from his night near the gardens, Holiday manages to identify the officer driving as Grady Dunne without Ramone's help. Ramone meets Holiday and tells him that Johnson's death was not related to the palindrome murders. Ramone convinces Holiday to identify Tinsley as the man he saw in the gardens on the night of Johnson's death in order to strengthen the White case because he abused Tinsley's rights in order to get the information he needed. Holiday is surprised to find that Ramone is not as straight as he believed.

Ramone returns to the gardens and finds Asa Johnson's journal hidden near where his body was found. He reads the diary in full and finds that Johnson had a relationship with a man who used the pseudonym ""RoboMan"". Ramone believes this was Johnson's math teacher Robert Bolton. Ramone resolves to trace the origins of the gun Johnson used, finding it belonged to Terrance Johnson which he remains quiet about. Instead he passes the information about the teacher on to the Morals Unit.

Holiday keeps the information about Johnson's suicide from Cook as he is worried it will demoralise him. Holiday and Cook follow Dunne to the gas station where Wilson works and are excited at the potential connection. They split up and Holiday confronts Dunne and realises that while he is corrupt he was not involved in Johnson's death.  Holiday resolves to tell Cook the truth. Cook follows Wilson and then goes to his home with plans to break in.  Cook approaches the house but becomes suddenly unwell and passes away in his car outside.

Holiday tells Ramone that Cook is missing and eventually finds his body. Holiday moves it to another location to avoid the press saying that Cook was still obsessed with the palindrome case.  Blaming himself for Cook's death, he resolves to break into Wilson's home himself. In an unrelated drug shootout, Dunne is on the take, and in the melee, Brock, Benjamin and Dunne are killed and Henderson flees.

The novel closes with a return to 1985 and the revelation that Wilson was responsible for the palindrome murders, hiding trophies from each victim in his record collection.

Her first name is easily misspelt and she is sometimes wrongly credited as Sybille Blanc.

Personal life

Blanc is the daughter of Pierre-Alain Blanc who is a former mayor of Aubonne and a teacher of physical education.   Sport is important to her father who organised a triathlon in Aubonne every year. As part of her fitness routine she regularly plays badminton with her father.

She lives in a charming sixth floor apartment in a building without an elevator.  ""C'est pratique, j'ai trouvé un appartement avec fitness intégré! (It's practical, I've found an apartment with fitness built in!)"" she said jokingly in an interview with Wladimir Bianchi  She first came across her apartment when she went there to read for her first professional theatrical role as Cordélia in King Lear.  She fell in love with it immediately.  Several years later she saw in a newspaper, next to an article about herself, an advertisement that the apartment was available.

As well as fitness Blanc also takes her diet very seriously and eats primarily fruit and steamed vegetables and tries to drink two litres of tea every day.

Career

Blanc studied dramatic arts at the Ecole Supérieure d'Art Dramatique (ESAD) in Geneva graduating in 1996.  Early in her professional career she appeared on several children's TV programs produced by the TSR including Smash and Bus et compagnie.  Her first major role came with the TSR produced sitcom Bigoudi where she played Laura for 50 episodes from 1996 to 1998.  Since that time she has frequently appeared on television programs produced by the French-language Swiss national TV station, TSR.

She has a tremendous ability to play a diverse range of roles which was brought out in her portrayal of the various female characters in Matt Cameron's play Ruby Moon and in the numerous comedy cabaret shows (La Revue 2000, Les nouvelles brèves de comptoir and La Revue de Cuche et Barbezat) which she has performed in.  In the latter and in the musical Irma la Douce she was able to display her strong talent for singing and dancing.  She has played numerous classical characters in plays by such authors as Shakespeare, Wilde, Miller, Beckett, Labiche and Pagnol as well as more modern roles in plays by authors such as Ruccello, Cameron and Dear. Blanc is fluent in both English and French and has even played an American in Hazanov's film Salade(s) Russe(s).

She was the lead singer in an innovative local Geneva based band, Booty Machine, between 2008 and 2009.

On top of acting and singing she has also co-hosted the morning radio shows Le 6-9 on Radio NRJ in 2001 and Les Matinales on Lausanne FM from 2006 to 2007.  Since its formation in 2008 she has been the voice of Lausanne based radio station LFM and she has appeared numerous times on the Radio Télévision Suisse comedy show Les Dicodeurs.

She has hosted many events.  Notable amongst these are GRAND (Grand Prix Romand de la Création - an award ceremony for outstanding work in the field of communications in the French part of Switzerland)  in 2011 and 2013 and the second largest stage (originally called Le Chapiteau and presently called Les Arches) at the Paleo Festival between 2000 and 2017.

Since turning 40 she has earned her bachelor's degree in Linguistics and Psychology and her master's degree in Speech Therapy at the University of Geneva.  She also announced at a showing of the film ""Sam"" in 2015 that she was working on a script for a future film.

The following information has been compiled from Blanc's agent's website, the Swiss French actor's website Comedien.ch, the International Movie Database. and from the Swiss Films website.

He is sometimes erroneously credited as the originator of the Enigma machine, although this has been shown to be the work of German engineer Arthur Scherbius.

Koch filed for his rotor machine patent on 7 October 1919, and was granted Netherlands patent 10,700 (equivalent to ), held by Naamloze Vennootschap Ingenieursbureau Securitas in Amsterdam. No machine was built from his patents, and, in 1927, he assigned the rights to Arthur Scherbius, the inventor of the Enigma machine. Scherbius had developed the idea of rotor machine encryption independently from Koch, and had filed for his own patent in 1918. Bauer (1999) writes that Scherbius bought Koch's patents ""obviously not because he did not own patents before; presumably he wanted to protect his patents"".

874,['Most voters never read moreed than the title and summary of the text of initiative proposals .'],"A ballot title is the official, short, summary of a referendum that appears on the ballot.  The goal of a good ballot title is to be a neutral summary that accurately conveys to voters the gist of what the proposed new law says or would do. The National Conference of State Legislatures says, ""The ballot title and summary are arguably the most important part of an initiative in terms of voter education. Most voters never read more than the title and summary of the text of initiative proposals. Therefore, it is of critical importance that titles and summaries be concise, accurate and impartial.""

United States

Differences between states
One way that states differ in laws governing the initiative process has to do with whether the ballot title is determined before signatures are collected, or after.

Another way that states differ has to do with whether the ballot title is determined by the government (which could be a commission, a ballot title determination board, the Secretary of State, or some other election official) or whether the ballot title is determined by the political organization that is advocating for the measure.

Pre-circulation ballot titles
States where the ballot title is set prior to circulation include:

Alaska, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Idaho, Maine, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, North Dakota, Ohio, Oregon (In Oregon, the ballot title is set after 1,000 initial sponsorship signatures have been submitted) and Washington.

Post-circulation ballot titles
States where the ballot title is determined by the government after the signatures have been collected are:

Arizona, Michigan, Nebraska, Nevada, Oklahoma, Utah, Wyoming.

The destruction of Tiberias by the Druze resulted in abandonment of the city by its Jewish community, until it was rebuilt by Zahir al-Umar in early eighteenth century. Altshuler however attributes the destruction of Tiberias in 1660 to an earthquake. The destruction could have also been a combination of both events.

Tiberias in the sixteenth century
As the Ottoman Empire expanded along the southern Mediterranean coast under sultan Selim I, the Catholic Monarchs began establishing Inquisition commissions. Many Conversos, (Marranos and Moriscos) and Sephardi Jews fled to the Ottoman provinces, settling at first in Constantinople, Salonika, Sarajevo, Sofia and Anatolia. The Sultan encouraged them to settle in Palestine. In 1558, a Portuguese-born marrano, Doña Gracia, was granted tax collecting rights in Tiberias and its surrounding villages by Suleiman the Magnificent. She envisaged the town becoming a refuge for Jews and obtained a permit to establish Jewish autonomy there. In 1561 her nephew Joseph Nasi, the Sultan-appointed Lord of Tiberias, encouraged Jews to settle in Tiberias. Securing a firman from the Sultan, he and Joseph ben Adruth rebuilt the city walls and laid the groundwork for a  textile (silk) industry, planting mulberry trees and urging craftsmen to move there. In 1624, when the Sultan recognized Fakhr-al-Din II as Lord of Arabistan (from Aleppo to the borders of Egypt), the Druze leader made Tiberias his capital.

The 1660 destruction
The destruction of Tiberias by the Druze resulted in the Jewish community fleeing entirely. Unlike Tiberias, which became desolate for many years, the nearby city of Safed recovered from its destruction by Arabs in 1660 relatively quickly, not becoming entirely abandoned, remaining an important Jewish center in the Galilee.

Aftermath
In the 1720s, Zahir al-Umar a Bedouin ruler of Ottoman Galilee, fortified the town of Tiberias and signed an agreement with the neighboring Bedouin tribes to prevent looting. Richard Pococke, who visited Tiberias in 1738, witnessed the building of a fort to the north of the city, and the strengthening of the old walls, attributing it to a dispute with the pasha (ruler) of Damascus. Under Zahir's patronage, Jewish families were encouraged to settle in Tiberias. He invited Chaim Abulafia of Smyrna to rebuild the Jewish community.

Amnesty International

Jacobs' consulting work led to a project at Amnesty International that changed the course of her life and career. In 2004 she wrote the Stolen Sisters Report, a ground-breaking document that exposed the racialized and sexualized violence suffered by Indigenous women in Canada, and the failure of law enforcement to protect them or to prosecute their attackers. It helped catalyze the founding of the Sisters In Spirit movement, which worked to push government, police, and media to pay attention to the growing number of missing and murdered Indigenous woman in Canada, and the large number of unsolved cases.

Native Women's Association of Canada

In 2004 Jacobs entered the world of Indigenous politics, running and winning the election for President of the Native Women's Association of Canada (NWAC), largely on her work with families of missing and murdered aboriginal women. Jacobs was re-elected for a second term as President of NWAC in 2006.

As president of NWAC Jacobs negotiated $10 million in funding from the federal government to support research into 500 of the missing and murdered Indigenous women, to create a national registry, a hotline, and public education programs.

Vigils became a hallmark of the Sisters in Spirit movement. Families of the missing and murdered would gather with pictures of the missing women, sometimes lighting candles or releasing balloons all as a means of trying to attract media attention to their cause. Bridget Tolley, an Algonquin woman whose mother was killed by Quebec police in 2001, is credited with proposing the idea to NWAC as a media strategy.  

In her role as president, Jacobs attended the 2008 meeting at which Prime Minister Stephen Harper formally apologized to survivors for abuses under the residential school system.

Jacobs chose not to run in the 2009 election. Her pregnant cousin went missing in January 2008; her murdered body was found three months later. The perpetrator was prosecuted and convicted.

Families of Sisters in Spirit

After Jacobs left NWAC, the Conservative federal government, led by Stephen Harper, cancelled the Sisters in Spirit project. They said they would not fund any future projects if NWAC used the name Sisters in Spirit in any of its programming.

But families who had met through the Sister in Spirit campaign formed Facebook groups, and stayed in touch, and continued to hold vigils, forming a new social movement. In 2012 alone, 163 vigils were held across Canada. Families also began pushing for a National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Women. The federal Conservative government refused to consider an inquiry. After they were unseated in 2015, the newly governing Liberal Party quickly announced they would hold an inquiry.
 
Jacobs continued to practice law on a part-time basis. She also completed an interdisciplinary PhD in Law, Sociology and Aboriginal Health at the University of Calgary, Alberta. She remained involved with the movement Families of Sisters in Spirit at the grassroots level, and joined the voices advocating for a national inquiry.

Ending Violence Association of British Columbia
By 2014 Jacobs was working with the Ending Violence Association of British Columbia. This province has had a high rate of missing and murdered indigenous women. In June 2014 leaders of civil and aboriginal governments signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) ""to end all forms of violence against Aboriginal women and girls. It was signed by leaders from the provincial government, including Premier Christy Clark, and Aboriginal leadership across British Columbia, including the BC-AFN, the First Nations Summit and Metis Nation-BC.""

The B.C. government had already committed $400,000 to the Giving Voice Initiative, intended to ""help Aboriginal communities speak out and take action on the issue of domestic violence"". In addition, the government released the Provincial Domestic Violence Plan in February 2014, attaching $5.5 million to a 3-year project to tackle this problem. It includes $2 million for programs for Aboriginal peoples affected by domestic violence.

Awards and honours
In October 2008, Jacobs was honored by Canadian Voice of Women for Peace, Canadian Department of Peace Initiative, and Civilian Peace Service Canada for furthering a culture of peace in Canada. 
In November 2008, she received the Governor General's Award in commemoration of the Persons Case, for her role in advancing women's equality.
 In May 2010, she received a Circle of Honour Esquao Award from the Institute for the Advancement of Aboriginal Women in Edmonton, Alberta.  
On December 1, 2016, she received a Franco-German Prize for Human Rights and the Rule of Law from the Governments of France and Germany for her human rights fight on issues relating to Missing and Murdered Indigenous women and girls in Canada.

Blake was Home Secretary in the British government. He was regularly in contact with Harry Pearce, regarding National Security.

History
He was introduced as part of the security council siding with then National Security Coordinator Juliet Shaw. He was opposed to the plans of a senior MI6 agent Michael Collingwood, Collingwood was leading a coup attempt and had a bomb planted in Blake's car. Blake survived the assassination attempt.

Blake was seen again at the beginning of Series 6 when he covertly ordered the Tehran train bomb, however, he was acting on false intelligence provided by Bob Hogan. Soon after a biological virus released from the train infected a man named Mehan Asnik. The virus was brought back to the UK. MI5 stopped this and meanwhile Blake was in negotiation with the Russians over a solution. He was then seen again later in the series when he ordered the false assassination of Section D to keep the team busy while his Policy Advisor, Jason Belling reassured Iranian Special Consul Bakshi about the team's death. Belling then convinced Bakshi about buying safe nuclear reactors which could not make nuclear bombs.

Blake reappears in Series 7, Episode 3 when Section D are tracking an active Al-Qaeda cell that is planning an attack on crowded places in London, mostly markets. Blake at first refuses to raise the national threat level, stating that the British public need good news due to the housing and financial crisis. He is seen in the House of Commons, proposing a British Day as a national holiday. Harry Pearce reveals to Ros Myers that Blake is extremely patriotic and feels proud to be British. After the Al-Qaeda crisis is resolved, Blake meets with Sir Richard, Harry's new boss, Harry and Ros. Sir Richard attempts to scapegoat Ros but Ros states that she doesn't care about what people think of her. This seemingly impresses Blake, who agrees to raise the national threat level to Severe. Blake is last seen in the House of Commons again, thanking MI5 for stopping the attacks with no civilian casualties, albeit two SO19 officers being killed. He makes a resounding speech attacking Al Qaeda, being met with roaring approval from MP's.

He also appears being briefed by Harry and Ros in Episode 4 when Al-Qaeda's number three wanted to negotiate. He was forced to allow a pardon and release of two prisoners from Guantanamo Bay prison. He is last seen in that Episode watching the TV as a House of Commons restaurant is destroyed by Al-Qaeda, however the people inside had been evacuated by Section D and the explosion was staged.

In Episode 7, where he is informed that Harry Pearce has supposedly been passing secrets to the Russians. He enters the Grid and is briefed by Director-General, Sir Richard Dolby on Harry's supposed deception. Blake talks to Harry in the interrogation room and angrily tells him he will lose everything for his betrayal. When Harry is proved innocent by Lucas North and Ros Myers, Harry is released. Soon after, he and Blake meet and share a conciliatory handshake; on Harry's recommendation, Blake awards Ben Kaplan a Distinguished Service Order (Kaplan died trying to stop the actual mole, analyst Connie James from escaping).

Finally in Episode 8, Blake is told by Harry of an imminent Russian nuclear threat with a suitcase bomb. With less than three hours until it goes off, Harry tells Blake to expect a phone call from either Harry or someone from Section D at 2:45pm. Blake was told that if he received the call, then he should evacuate Parliament, Buckingham Palace and Whitehall.

Blake received the phone call from Jo Portman at that time, after a brief conversation Jo ends the call. Blake then calls the Cabinet Office and says he is invoking Protocol Landslide, an emergency evacuation of the government and royal family to deep-level nuclear shelters. Seconds after Blake ends the call, alarms ring inside the Home Office for personnel to be evacuated. Blake is last seen, however, electing to remain at his desk, privately willing Harry to find the bomb in time.

Blake was approached by Ros Myers when she is trying to find out the truth behind Harry's disappearance. He declares that he counts Harry as a friend but that he can't do what Ros wants him to do. After the events of Episode 2, Blake approached Harry with intelligence of a meeting taking place in Basel of corrupt intelligence officers, Blake had Harry investigate this.

In Episode 6, Blake was forced to resign when the Nightingale operation falsely provided information to the media that Blake had done dodgy deals with the Mafia. Although Blake's actions throughout the day had managed to prevent Britain from going bankrupt, he resigned after a long conversation with Harry, who offered his support. He was seen pushing through press to get to his car and then being driven away. Soon afterward, Harry said of his ally's downfall: ""I might have known it couldn't last – a decent politician.""

He was featured in the first episode of the ninth series, being revealed as a senior member of Nightingale who ordered the hotel bombing during the Pakistan-India summit, resulting in the death of Ros Myers and Blake's successor Andrew Lawrence at the end of the Series 8 with Blake's resignation being a smokescreen to cover up his Nightingale affiliation. Harry Pearce visited him at his home in Scotland, poisoning him with tainted whisky which caused Blake to appear to die from a heart attack; before Blake died he expressed regret and sadness about Ros' death and commented that by being a member of Nightingale, he had a chance to change the system for good.

Synopsis
A sorcerer would take the form of a beggar to abduct young women as his would-be brides. After bringing the eldest sister of a family back to his home, he assured her she would be happy with him.  Eventually, the sorcerer leaves but not before handing her the keys to all the rooms in the house and an egg to look after that was to be on her person at all times. However, he forbade her to enter one particular room in the house under the penalty of death. Ultimately, the sister did investigate the forbidden room out of curiosity and discovered a basin of blood at its center. Shocked at the dismembered body parts that existed within it, she dropped the egg.

Once back home, the sorcerer could tell by the bloodied egg that the sister had gone against his will in his absence and had her suffer the same fate as the others from the room. Subsequently, a second sister from the family was carried off only for the same outcome to occur as that of the first. It then came to be that the youngest sister found herself in the very same situation. But unlike her sisters, the youngest had put aside the egg before exploring the house.  In the forbidden room, she found and assembled her sisters' remains which united and brought the sisters to life again.

Finding her egg unstained upon his return, the sorcerer was ready to marry the youngest sister. Freed from his power, she had the sorcerer carry a basket of gold back to her family without rest. She indicated that she would be watching from a window at his progress while she would make preparations for a wedding. Unbeknownst to the sorcerer, the voice that would scold him whenever he tried to take a break on his journey came from one the two sisters hidden inside the gold-brimmed basket and not his bride.

Meanwhile, the youngest sister dressed up a skull and let it rest at the garret window, looking outwards; and covered herself with honey and feathers, so she looked like a strange bird. She left the house intending to reunite with her family. Along her way, she is addressed as ""Fitcher's Bird"" by passing guests to the wedding and the sorcerer returning from his delivery and asked of the whereabouts of the bride. As the bird, she replied that the bride had cleaned the entirety of the house and was now looking out from the window. Once the guests and sorcerer had all entered the house, the three sisters' brothers and relatives barred the doors and set the house ablaze.

Etymology
Regarding the meaning of Fitcher, the Grimms wrote in the notes to the tale that ""The Icelandic fitfuglar (swimming-bird), which looked as white as a swan, will help to explain Fitcher's Vogel,"" and although this ""swan"" theory was endorsed by , later commentators merely gloss  as ""web-footed bird,"" which is the Cleasby-Vigfusson dictionary definition. Others scholars advocate the view that the word derives from German  ""feather"" or Fittich ""wings"".

Literary analogues
Modern folklorists classify the tale under AT 311 ""Rescue by the Sister."" A large comprehensive list of analogues to Fitchers Vogel, spanning many languages, can be found in the companion volume to the Grimms' KHM, the Anmerkungen edited by Johannes Bolte and Jiří Polívka, although this list is not culled down to contain only the AT 311 types.

A Norwegian analogue, The Old Dame and Her Hen (in the AT 311 tale group) was noted as analogue by the Brothers Grimm. This Asbjørnsen and Moe folktale shares some essential features, such as the rescuer being of female gender, the other sisters being restored to life, and the villain being tricked into carrying the revived sisters back to their home. However, it lacks the ""forbidden chamber"" element, and she is merely confined to her captor's dwelling.

The Italian tale How the Devil Married Three Sisters belongs in this group. Here, the forbidden door is not bloody but leads to fiery hell. There are at least ten published Italian variants, e.g. Il diavolo dal naso d'argento ""The Devil with the silver nose"", more fully listed in the article for the Italian counterpart.

Another tale of similar plot and setting is the Scottish ""The Widow and her Daughters"", Campbell's Popular Tales, No. 41.

Insofar as the ""Fitcher's Bird"" is a tale of a serial-killing husband who compels his brides to the rule of the ""Forbidden Chamber"" (motif C611), it is closely similar to the Bluebeard (AT 312) type tales. And just as in Grimm's tale the bloodied egg gives away the misconduct of the elder sisters, the bloody key is the telltale sign that Bluebeard's wives have peeked in the forbidden chamber (motif C913 ""Bloody key as sign of disobedience"").

Among Grimm's fairy tales, the forbidden door features here and in Mary's Child (AT 710), as have been remarked in the notes to that tale.

Some European variants of the ballad Lady Isabel and the Elf Knight, Child ballad 4, closely resemble this tale.

Modern adaptations
 Gregory Frost sets the tale among the doomsday religious cults of 19th century New York in his 2002 novel Fitcher's Brides.
 In 2007, the theatre group BooTown adapted a short play based on the Brothers Grimm fairy tale, called Fitcher's a Bastard, but his bird's alright.
 American artist Cindy Sherman adapted the story in a photographic spread for Vanity Fair.

898,"['The colour blood red ised a dark shade of the colour red mean to resemble the colour of human blood ( which is composed of oxygenated red erythrocytes , white leukocytes , and yellow blood plasma ) .', 'The colour "" blood reded "" , therefore , covers both these states : the darker deoxygenate colour and the brighter oxygenated one .']","The colour blood red is a dark shade of the colour red meant to resemble the colour of human blood (which is composed of oxygenated red erythrocytes, white leukocytes, and yellow blood plasma).  It is the iron in hemoglobin specifically that gives blood its red colour.  The actual colour ranges from crimson to a dark brown-blood depending on how oxygenated the blood is, and may have a slightly orange hue.  Deoxygenated blood, which circulates closer to the body's surface and which is therefore generally more likely to be seen than oxygenated blood, issues from bodily veins in a dark red state, but quickly oxygenates upon exposure to air, turning a brighter shade of red.  This happens more quickly with smaller volumes of blood such as a pinprick and less quickly from cuts or punctures that cause greater blood flows such as a puncture in the basilic vein: all blood collected during a phlebotomy procedure is deoxygenated blood, and it does not usually have a chance to become oxygenated upon leaving the body. Arterial blood, which is already oxygenated, is also already a brighter shade of red— this is the blood see from a pulsating neck, arm, or leg wound, and it does not change colour upon exposure to air.  The colour ""blood red"", therefore, covers both these states: the darker deoxygenated colour and the brighter oxygenated one.  Also, dried blood often has a darker, rust-coloured quality: all dried blood has been oxygenated and then desiccated, causing the cells within it to die.  This blood is often darker than either shade of red that can be seen in fresh blood.  

In the RGB colour spectrum blood red often consists only of the colour red, with no green or blue component; in the CYMK colour model blood red has no cyan, and consists only of magenta and yellow with a small amount of black.  It is frequently darker than either maroon or dark red.

Variants
Different sources have proposed different color schemes for the color blood red.  Below are some of these.

Together with its nearby military fortress, Presidio La Bahía, the mission upheld Spanish territorial claims in the New World against encroachment from France. The third and final location near Goliad, Texas is maintained now as part of Goliad State Park and Historic Site.

Establishment
Established on 1722 on Matagorda Bay near La Salle's Fort Saint Louis on Garcitas Creek, as the mission and complementing presidio the fort was intended to secure the Texas coastline from the French and to gather the local Cocos, Copanes, and Cujanes. Being unable to attract the Indians to stay at the mission and due to violence with the Spanish soldiers, the mission was relocated only four years later, to a more favorable location on the Guadalupe River. Artifacts from this settlement are currently on display at the Museum of the Coastal Bend in Victoria.

Moved in 1726 near Victoria, the mission was established among the Tamique and Aranama Indians in Mission Valley. Dams and stone acequias were built to carry water from the river to the mission. A ranching outpost was also built of mortar and stone at Tonkawa Bank, on the river about 12 miles below. The presidio also followed and was built at what was later to become Fernando de León's Ranch. The establishment prospered for 26 years, producing enough grain and hay to trade with other Spanish settlements. It was at this time that the foundation for cattle and horse ranching started. Although prosperous, Spanish officials recommended moving the mission to secure the area between Béxar and East Texas from the encroachment of the French and English.

Relocation to Goliad
Mission La Bahía moved in 1749 to what is now Goliad, Texas on the San Antonio River. Temporary ""jacales"" housing was built from log and clay (waddle and daub), with construction of stone and mortar outer defensive walls and interior buildings initiated—but not reaching completion until 1758. The mission facilities inside the surrounding stone walls included rooms to house the priests and the Indian families, a granary, workrooms, and a separately located forge.  Just across the river the complementing fortress Presidio La Bahía was built.  The mission found success educating and serving the tribes Aranama, Piguique, Manos de Perro, Tamique, Tawakoni, and Tonkawa in the area, but by the early 1830s was facing opposition from raiding Apaches and Comanches.

The mission became the first large cattle ranch in Texas, with near 40,000 free-roaming cattle at the height of production in about 1778. The large herds of Texas longhorns and mustangs were cared for by the vaquero Indians from the mission. The mission inhabitants also grew large crops of grain, fruit, and vegetables to support themselves and for trade with others. Cattle and livestock were also driven to and traded with the other missions in east Texas and western Louisiana.

Closing and restoration
The mission was to be secularized in 1794, but La Bahía remained in service until Mexican Independence in 1821. However, two Franciscans refused to leave and remained as parish priests. In 1830 the mission was finally secularized. With most Indians having already left, the premium lands of the mission were acquired by the local Mexican and American colonists. The mission itself devolved to the City of Goliad. The old mission's stones were also allowed to be removed and used for local construction. The city leased the site between 1848–1856, first for a Baptist school and then a Presbyterian school, but the building gradually fell into ruin.

The mission ruins became part of the newly created Goliad State Park in 1931. In 1933, the Civil Works Administration began reconstruction of the stone chapel and granary following drawings from the National Park Service and San Antonio architect Atlee Ayres. Civilian Conservation Corps Company 3822(V), with funds provided by the Works Progress Administration, finished restoring the mission between 1935 and 1941. Additional construction in the 1960s and 1980s brought the mission back its 1749 appearance.

The mission was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on August 22, 1977. The park is currently operated by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department.

Intended for use as a weapon for the disruption of enemy bomber formations, it failed to find favor among Air Force planners and did not undergo development.

Development
The Sky Scorcher project was proposed by the Convair Division of General Dynamics to the United States Air Force in 1956. The missile was intended to be carried by an advanced, enlarged version of Convair's F-106 Delta Dart interceptor, which had, at the time, not yet entered flight testing even in its baseline form.

Sky Scorcher was a very large missile, which was projected to be capable of carrying a thermonuclear warhead with a yield of two megatons. The oversized warhead would be used against attacking formations of supersonic bombers; it was anticipated that fourteen such initiations, at a distance of approximately  from the bombers' target, would be sufficient to disrupt an attack. A force of eighty of the advanced fighters were proposed for carrying the weapon.

Despite Convair's sales pitch and the anticipated effectiveness of the weapon, the Air Force was unenthusiastic about the concept; aside from the expense of developing the aircraft and weapon, the Sky Scorcher missile also suffered from the fact that there would be significant effects on the ground below the location of an airburst of a multi-megaton nuclear warhead. As a result, the project was abandoned before any significant work was undertaken.

The Tirukkural is divided into three sections known as books. Book One deals with aram or fundamental ethics of life, with conscience and honor; Book Two discusses porul or political or social realities or facts of life; and Book Three dwells on inbam or the human love. The first book has 38 chapters, the second has 70 chapters and the third has 25 chapters. Each chapters consists of 10 couplets or kurals, thus making 1330 couplets in total. The work emphasizes non-violence and moral vegetarianism as virtues for an individual. Tirukkural is one of the literary works in the world translated the most number of times. According to Institute of Asian Studies, Thiruvanmiyur, more than 40 translations are available.

The Security Council noted proposals from resolutions 661 (1991), 687 (1991) and 715 (1991) for the United Nations Special Commission and director of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to develop a mechanism to monitor Iraqi imports and exports of weapons in a letter received on 7 December 1995.

Acting under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, the security council approved the proposals in the letter subject to the provisions of the current resolution. It was affirmed that the mechanism would not impair the operation of future or existing non-proliferation agreements, and that requests for sales to Iraq made by countries or Iraqi requests to export items should be addressed to the commission established in Resolution 661.

All countries were asked about arms supplies to Iraq and to submit information to the joint unit of the commission and the IAEA, and to notify the joint unit of any attempts by companies to circumvent the mechanism, and also cases where Iraq has not followed procedure. Within 45 days, member states were to be provided with the relevant information from the special commission and director general of the IAEA regarding the implementation of the procedures of the mechanism. The security council demanded that Iraq meet all its obligations under the mechanism.

Commencing on 11 April 1996, the Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali and the director general of the IAEA were required to report periodically on progress every six months.

He held the WBA and WBC titles from 1971 and 1974, he regained the titles in January 1975 that included The Ring title but lost it right away on June of the same year. He once again won the WBA and The Ring title in 1976.

Childhood and early career 
Wajima was born in Karafuto, (current Sakhalin) which became Soviet territory when Wajima was three years old. He and his family moved to Shibetsu, Hokkaidō, but barely managed to make a living, Wajima was put up for adoption. He lived with his stepfamily while his parents worked in Shibetsu.

Wajima began to work as a fisherman with his stepfamily. He was still in middle school, but had to work from sunset all the way to daybreak. The only time he had to sleep was during class. He was a fighter from a young age, having to work tirelessly each day, and often picking fights with other kids.

After graduating from middle school, he traveled to Tokyo, where he worked briefly as a truck driver before joining the Misako Boxing Gym. He made his professional debut in March, 1968, at the age of 25.

Professional career 
Wajima captured the Japanese light-middleweight title in September, 1969. He defended the title 9 times before returning it. He got his first shot at the world title against Carmelo Bossi for the world light middleweight title on October 31, 1971, in Tokyo, winning by 15-round split decision to capture his first world title. He made his first defense in May, 1972, taking less than 2 minutes to knock out his opponent. He would defend the title a total of 6 times. He quickly became one of the most popular boxers in Japan for his peculiar ""Frog Jump"" uppercut punch.

He lost his 7th defense to Oscar Albarado in 1974 by KO in the 15th round. He got a rematch with Albarado 7 months later, on January 21, 1975, and managed to avenge his loss with a 15-round decision win to regain the Lineal, WBC and WBA titles. He was stripped of the WBC title in March, and lost to Jae-Doo Yuh to lose his Lineal and WBA light middleweight titles as well. However, he regained his Lineal and WBA titles in February, 1976, with a 15th-round KO over Yuh.

Wajima lost to Jose Manuel Duran in his first defense, losing the world title for the third time in his career. He fought his final match In June, 1977, challenging Eddie Gazo for the WBA super welterweight title, but lost by 11th-round KO. This was the last fight of his career. His record was 31-6-1 (25KOs).

Professional boxing record

Post retirement 
Like many other Japanese boxers, Wajima became a successful television personality after retiring, and has appeared on game shows and television dramas. He became the head of the Eastern Japan Boxing Council, and has founded his own boxing gym in Tokyo. His brother-in-law also runs a successful dumpling store in Kokubunji, Tokyo. He also claims that condemned prisoner Iwao Hakamada is innocent. Hakamada was later released after 45 years in prison, due to new evidence and discovery of the prosecution's reliance on falsified evidence.

The spelling of Steven Walls’s name was changed to “Stephen” in the movie.

Johnny Ashcroft and Gay Kayler performed the vocals on the movie sound track, also a specially recorded version of the Little Boy Lost hit song, which is played at the end of the film.

Scenes were shot on location in Guyra, Tubbamurra and Narrabeen, New South Wales, Australia.

The World Premiere was held in Armidale, New South Wales. 
 Johnny Ashcroft and Gay Kayler sang the Little Boy Lost song from the movie live on stage to Nathan Dawes and his stand-in, Toshi Bourke, son of Terry Bourke (movie director).

Synopsis
The film is based on the true story of a missing Australian child, Steven Walls (played by Dawes). After his disappearance, a massive search is organized across the Guyra area as its citizens spring into action.

The problem in finding Steven is that he was taught not to speak to strangers, and is afraid of those who attempt to speak to him. He does not know that the crowds of people attempting to make contact are not enemies, but have volunteered to find him.

Four days elapse and hope of his rescue diminishes. A group of searchers finally spot the boy and are able to convince him that they are there to help him get back home to his family.

Production
The original director was John Powell and the budget was $150,000. Two weeks into the film in April 1978 the film was running into difficulties; $75,000 had been spent already and cheques to the crew were bouncing. Producer Allan Spiers called in Phil Avalon, who had just made a successful low budget film with Summer City. Avalon looked at the budget, felt that $200,000 was required to finish the film, and succeeded in raising the additional funds from the investors, who he says were state government senators from Brisbane. Avalon negotiated with the actors to reduce their fees, which he felt were too excessive for a low budget film. Avalon says ninety percent of the cast agreed to do this. He then tried to do this with the crew, and several of them left, including the cinematographer. Unions threatened to shut down the film but Avalon managed to keep it afloat.

Avalon hired Terry Bourke, who had directed him on Inn of the Damned, to rewrite the script and direct the rest of the movie with Powell. The rest of the film was completed in nine days.

Steven Walls, who inspired the story, plays a small role as one of the men at the bar, who are asked to join in the search. Johnny Ashcroft has a brief cameo as one of the searchers by the camp fire at night. Steven's grandmother and many of the original searchers acted as searchers in the movie.

Release
The film premiered in Armidale, NSW.

Avalon says he and Bourke fell out over the editing of the film and that Bourke ""refused to listen. I could have fired him but rather than go through the process I walked and took my name off the film."" Avalon quit the film industry for the next five years.

Terry Bourke later sued producer Alan Spires, production company John Powell Productions and distributors Filmways for $6,130 in unpaid wages.

Avalon says the film ""was a very unhappy experience. The film didn't do any real business. The day-to-day pressure of dealing with finance, unions, crew and talent who had not forgiven me for the reduction in their salaries, saw me lose weight and keep to myself. When it finished I decided to break from the film industry. Under pressure I also sought help from a crew member, which was a mistake. After the movie, Karmen [his wife] and I decided to separate. It was one of the worst years of my life.""

Legacy
Terry Bourke published a book titled Little Boy Lost that was based on his screenplay. 

Steven Walls died on his Guyra property in April 2020.

The Guyra Historical Museum’s Steven Walls / Little Boy Lost display opened on 3 October 2020. A poster and details of the movie are featured.

The Johnny Ashcroft and Gay Kayler Legacy Collection was presented to the Australian Country Music Hall of Fame in Tamworth (Gamilaraay Country) on 28 May 2022, with a Welcome to Country and Smoking Ceremony.

The segment, Little Boy Lost, the Search, Song, Movie and Beyond, with one hundred and three items in its catalogue, was part of this impressive Collection. Tamworth Regional Council news report

He is known as a member of Sechs Kies, which was a rival band to the top boy group in the 90's, H.O.T. and reunited in 2016. When Sechs Kies disbanded in 2000, he started a new band, J-Walk with Jang Suwon, also from Sechs Kies. Kim is known for his Busan accent and his nickname is ""Ducky"" as a reference to his name.

Career

Early years and formation of SechsKies 
Kim and fellow Busan native Lee Jai-jin  formed a dance crew called Quicksilver, and was selected as a trainee in Lee Juno's company. Lee Juno was famous as Seo Taiji and Boys' member. At that time Lee Ho yeon, Daesung Entertainment's CEO, asked him to recommend an idol group member.  That is how he became a Sechs Kies's member. 
In 2016, Kang Sung-hoon said that he had watched the audition tape and chosen Kim as a member for his superior dancing skill. The duo moved to Seoul to finish high school while training at Daesung Entertainment.

1997–2000: SechsKies 
SechsKies made their debut in April 1997 and quickly came to be seen as a rival of H.O.T, who had debuted a year earlier and were considered the first K-pop idol group to achieve mainstream recognition and success. Kim and Lee, who were the main dancers and choreographers, were largely responsible for some of the group's most memorable dances. Kim was not given many singing parts and was instead known for rapping in the Busan dialect. SechsKies went on to establish themselves as one of the most popular boy bands of the late 1990s, scoring a string of #1 hits on music programs. However they suddenly disbanded in 2000 and performed for the final time at the Dream Concert that May at the Seoul Olympic Stadium.

After SechsKies disbanded 2000 when the members announced they wanted to split ways, Kim was set to become a dance instructor for Sechs Kies label Daesung Entertainment but he ended up joining with his former Sechs Kies member Jang Su-won to form a new duo J-Walk in 2002 under a new label, Kiss Entertainment.

They released their first album, entitled Suddenly in March 2002, and the title track, Suddenly, became a huge hit. They released second album Someday at the same year. Both two albums were well received and acclaimed and they took SBS Gayo Daejeon Popularity Award with former Sechs Kies member Kang Sung-hun in 2002.

Their first EP Sun Shower(여우비) was delayed until 2007 when they signed with Vitamin Entertainment. J-Walk released their third album My Love in 2008 and Eun Ji-won helped them by participating in the music video and featuring in the title song. Since Kim Jae-duck entered the military shortly after, Su-won had to promote the album by himself.

After Su-won was discharged from army, J-Walk has signed under A&G Modes and released some digital songs. They returned with mini album ""Love...Painfully"" with main track ""Strive"" in December 2013.

2016–present: SechsKies reunion 
In 2016, Kim reunited with his former bandmates through the variety show Infinite Challenge. There had already been prior speculation about a reunion as Kim himself, leader Eun Ji-won and vocalist Jang Su-won had cautiously hinted that all members were in discussions except vocalist Ko Ji-yong, who had completely left the entertainment industry to start his own business and was already married. During the ""Totoga"" segment of Infinite Challenge, the five members organized a guerrilla concert, the first time they had stood together on stage as SechsKies in over fifteen years. Ko made a surprise appearance backstage to reunite with the five members and during the concert for an emotional rendition of their award-winning hit ""Couple"". SechsKies (except Ko Ji-yong) signed with YG Entertainment for all group activities while Kim and other members remained with their individual management agencies. It was decided that they would promote as a group and temporarily postponed solo activities.

Outside of SechKies, Kim has appeared on several variety shows, usually with his friend Tony An. He co-hosted the restaurant touring show Delicious Man''' with An. He also appeared on Mom's Diary - My Ugly Duckling, a reality show that An was participating in.

 Personal life 
Kim is currently housemates with former H.O.T. member Tony An. The arrangement had caused a stir amongst their contemporaries as both groups were regarded as one another's fiercest industry rivals during the late 1990s and largely avoided any contact with one another despite crossing paths many times. They had met and befriended one another during their mandatory military service. In 2014 Kim became a director of the entertainment agency which Tony An founded, TN Nation Entertainment.

She is best known as the founder and first executive producer of Studio D of the National Film Board of Canada, the first government-funded film studio in the world dedicated to women filmmakers.

Career

Early career 
Shannon began her career in the Canadian film industry cataloging music for Crawley Films in Ottawa after dropping out of high school at the age of 16. She later joined the National Film Board (NFB) as an  editor in 1956 when she was 21. In her early years at the NFB Shannon worked as a sound, music, and picture editor. After Shannon had some 200 films to her credit as an editor she directed her first film, Goldwood in 1970. Goldwood was based on her childhood memories of one of the mining towns in Northern British Columbia where her father, a mining engineer, had worked.

From 1974 to 1975, Shannon produced and directed eleven short films that made up the Working Mothers film series. The films delve into the experiences of working mother's throughout Canada, with some of the films focused on an individual women, including Our Dear Sisters, whose subject was Indigenous filmmaker Alanis Obomsawin. The series was created as part of the NFB's Challenge for Change Program (1967-1980), which was a government funded initiative to bring the art and practice of film making to communities across Canada in an effort to incite social change. Initially meant to be one film, Shannon and distributive consultant Doris Mae Oulton proposed a format change of several short films and held small test screenings across different communities to try convince the NFB and the projects federal government sponsor of the new format's potential for success. With the new format approved, the Working Mother's series became arguably one of the most important achievements of Challenge for Change, and its success paved the way for Shannon's proposal for a women's studio within the NFB.

Studio D 
Shannon was the driving force behind the creation of Studio D. She lobbied the unenthusiastic NFB to create a women's film production unit that would produce feminist documentaries created by and for women. When the studio was launched in 1974, it was housed in the basement of the NFB headquarters in Montreal with a budget of $100,000 and three women on staff; Shannon, Margaret Pettigrew, and Yuki Yoshida.  Shannon became the first executive producer and remained in the role for 12 years before stepping down in June 1986.

In an interview with The Christian Science Monitor, Shannon outlined in what her opinion was the five objectives of Studio D: ""providing employment opportunities for women, providing training opportunities for women, meeting the information needs of women, creating an environment that would facilitate 'exploring our creativity in our own way', [and] bringing the perspective of women to bear 'on all social issues.'""

While executive producer, Shannon oversaw the creation and production of over 80 films, including Not a Love Story: A Film About Pornography (1981), and the Academy Award-winning documentaries I'll Find a Way (1977) and If You Love This Planet (1982).

Legacy 
In 1996 Studio D was closed due to decreased government funding and NFB layoffs. One of the last films produced by Studio D before it was shut down was a biographical documentary about Shannon entitled Kathleen Shannon: On Film, Feminism, and Other Dreams, directed by Gerry Rogers. The film includes personal interviews with Shannon as well as archival footage and photography. In the film Shannon reflects on various topics: from childhood, aging, and alcoholism, to the work-life balance, and her experiences during her time at the NFB and Studio D.

The NFB also established a documentary prize in Shannon's name, the ""Kathleen Shannon Award"" which is awarded annually at the Yorkton Short Film and Video Festival.

Personal life 
Shannon was married twice and had one son. After Shannon retired, she moved to the Kootenays where she opened a guest house for women and worked as a therapist.

In 1986, Shannon was awarded the Order of Canada because, ""Under her leadership, the National Film Board's Studio D - which she founded in 1974 - succeeded in producing award-winning socially and culturally committed films which have made Canada and the studio internationally known for the excellence and relevance of its work."" Shannon was also bestowed three honorary degrees: a Doctor of Laws from Queen's University in 1984, a Doctor of Letters from York University in 1996, and a Doctor of Humane Letters from Mount Saint Vincent University in 1997.

Shannon died on January 9, 1998 at the age of 62. She had been diagnosed with lung cancer two weeks prior, and died during surgery to remove a tumor in Kelowna, British Columbia.

For eight years he studied philosophy as a Jesuit and then became a podsędek (supply judge) in legal cases against the Jesuits concerning estates. He wrote a treatise entitled On the non-existence of God and was later executed on charges of atheism. His trial has been criticised and is seen as a case of legalised religious murder in Poland.

Life

Education and work 

Kazimierz Łyszczyński was born in Łyszczyce, in what is now Brest District, Brest Region, Belarus. He became a nobleman, landowner, philosopher, and soldier in the service of the Sapieha family. For eight years he studied philosophy as a Jesuit, but left the order and then became a supply judge (podsędek) in legal cases against the Jesuits concerning estates. He was also member of the Sejm of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

Łyszczyński had read a book by Henry Aldsted entitled Theologia Naturalis, which attempted to prove the existence of divinity. But its arguments were so confused that Łyszczyński was able to infer many contradictions. Ridiculing Aldsted, Łyszczyński wrote in the book's margins the words ""ergo non-est Deus"" (""therefore God does not exist"").

This was discovered by one of Łyszczyński's debtors, Jan Kazimierz Brzoska, who was the nuncio of Brest in Poland or a Stolnik of Bracławice or Łowczy of Brześć. Brzoska, reluctant to return a great sum of money lent him by Łyszczyński, accused the latter of being an atheist and gave the aforementioned work as evidence to Witwicki, bishop of Poznań. Brzoska also stole and delivered to the court a handwritten copy of De non-existentia Dei, which was the first Polish philosophical treatise presenting reality from an atheistic perspective, and which Łyszczyński had been working on since 1674.

Trial 
Witwicki along with Załuski, bishop of Kiev, took up this case with zeal. King John III Sobieski attempted to help Łyszczyński by ordering that he should be judged at Vilnius, but this could not save Łyszczyński from the clergy. Łyszczyński's first privilege as a Polish noble, that he could not be imprisoned before his condemnation, was violated. The Łyszczyński case was brought before the diet of 1689 where he was accused of having denied the existence of God and having blasphemed against the Virgin Mary and the saints. He was condemned to death for atheism.

Execution 

The sentence was carried out before noon in the Old Town Market Place in Warsaw, where his tongue was pulled out followed by a beheading. After that, his corpse was transported beyond the city borders and cremated.

Bishop Załuski gave the following account of the execution:

De non-existentia Dei
Łyszczyński wrote a treatise, De non-existentia Dei (On the non-existence of God), stating that God does not exist and that religions are inventions of man.

On the basis of a public denunciation, a trial was conducted before a Sejm commission. There is an actual transcript of the proceedings at the Kórnik library, including a speech by the Grand Duchy of Lithuania Instigator Regni Szymon Kurowicz Zabistowski, citing fragments of De non-existentia Dei. The treatise itself was destroyed by the Sejm, but the surviving cited fragments are as follows:

I – we beseech you, o' theologians, by your God, if in this manner do you not extinguish the light of Reason, do you not oust the sun from this world, do you not pull down your God from the sky, when attributing to him the impossible, whereof the characteristics and attributes contradict themselves.

II – Man is the creator of God, and God is a concept and creation of Man. Hence people are the architects and engineers of God, and God is not a true being but a being existing only within the mind; being chimeric by its nature, because a God and a chimera are the same thing.

III – Religion was constituted by people without religion, so they could be worshipped although the God is not existent. Piety was introduced by the unpietic. The fear of God was spread by the unafraid so that the people were afraid of them in the end. Devotion named godly is a design of Man. Doctrine, be it logical or philosophical, bragging to be teaching the truth of God, is false, and on the contrary, the one condemned as false, is the very true one.

IV – simple folk are cheated by the more cunning with the fabrication of God for their own oppression; whereas the same oppression is shielded by the folk in a way, that if the wise attempted to free them by the truth, they would be quelled by the very people.

V – nevertheless we do not experience within us and within any other such an imperative of reason, which would ensure us of a truth of divine revelation. Alas if they were present in us, then everyone would have to acknowledge them and would have no doubts and would not contradict the Writings of Moses and the Gospels – which is not true – and there would be no different congregations and their followers as Mahomet etc. Such an imperative is not known and there are not only doubts, but there are some who deny a revelation, and they are not fools, but wise men, who with a proper reasoning prove what? the very contrary, what I also prove here. Concluding, that God does not exist"".During his trial, Łyszczyński claimed that the work was to be about a Catholic and an atheist having a debate, in which the Catholic would eventually win (he told the diet that the work would have had a different title from De non-existentia Dei). The atheist was to speak first followed by the Catholic. He claimed that he only wrote the first half of the work (that is only the atheist's argument) and then stopped writing at the advice of a priest.

Status in modern Poland
Regardless of whether Łyszczyński was genuinely an atheist, in communist Poland he came to be celebrated as a martyr to the atheist cause. In a series of papers, the philosopher Andrzej Nowicki presented a romanticized view of Łyszczyński, stating that ""in terms of breadth of intellectual horizons, thoroughness of philosophical erudition, and boldness of thought, he was beyond doubt the most eminent Polish mind of the age.""

According to Pomian, ""It appears that Łyszczyński was sentenced to death for writing a treatise entitled 'De non-existentia Dei' ... and all that remains are a few notes which were made during the trial. Apart from this and also the fact that his execution caused some controversy at the time on account of his being a member of the gentry, next to nothing is known about Łyszczyński. Łyszczyński's importance as a martyr of the atheist cause has led to his romanticization by Nowicki and to his rescue from a murky cell in the obscure by-ways of history. A copious amount of writing has appeared concerning both what is not known about him and what the content of his thought might have been. Nowicki writes boldly: 'Polish intellectual life cannot boast of any one figure who could compare with Łyszczyński in terms of breadth of intellectual horizons, the thoroughness of philosophical erudition and the boldness of thought. He was beyond doubt the most eminent Polish mind of the epoch.' What a pity that no one knows what the content of his thought was. According to the notes made at the trial, Łyszczyński, was curiously 'modern', even to the point of incongruity, in his critique of religion: all of his remarks might have been made by Marx or Lenin ... Łyszczyński clearly states his disbelief in God. The incongruity of this idea, however, lies in an inability to understand its genesis in the context of Polish society at that time ...  there is no independent or clear evidence of other individuals with similar inclinations during Łyszczyński's time. To say that Łyszczyński was simply ahead of his time means nothing: it is an admission of the unavailability of an explanation.""

In March 2014, his persona and ideas were the key theme in a public performance during the 2014 Procession of Atheists in Poland, during which his execution was reenacted.

He attended Lord Wandsworth College in Hampshire, where he was a member of a band called Cirrus with Nick Ryall (guitar and flute) and Ray Coop (bass).

Career
Fisher's early bands were Whitewing (1975–1978) and the Xtians (1978), both during his time at the University of Bath.  In 1979, he joined up with Pete Byrne to form Neon, whose first single ""Making Waves/Me I See in You"" was released on their own 3D Music label. The band later went on to recruit Neil Taylor, Manny Elias, Curt Smith, and Roland Orzabal before they finally broke up in December 1981.  In 1982, Fisher and Pete Byrne, who were key figures in the early days of synth-pop, formed the duo Naked Eyes, while in 1981 Smith and Orzabal formed Tears for Fears.

Naked Eyes' two biggest hits were their rendition of the Burt Bacharach song ""Always Something There to Remind Me"", and the self-penned ""Promises, Promises"". They had two more US top 40 hits, ""When the Lights Go Out"" and ""(What) In the Name of Love"", before going their separate ways.  They resumed their writing partnership after a five-year break, and some of the songs written during this period appeared on the 2001 Pete Byrne album, The Real Illusion.

In 1987, Fisher re-emerged as one half of the pop duo Climie Fisher with singer-songwriter Simon Climie.  Together they took ""Love Changes (Everything)"" to the UK No. 2 spot, while the hip-hop inspired ""Rise to the Occasion"" also cracked the top 10 in the United Kingdom.

After the break-up of Climie Fisher, Fisher collaborated on several songs with Rick Astley and Jules Shear.  For some years, Fisher owned his own studio, The StoneRoom, in Shepherd's Bush, where, until shortly before his death, he had been working with Pete Byrne on a new Naked Eyes studio album.

Death
Fisher died on 25 August 1999, aged 42, following bowel surgery for cancer.

The station was started by Radio New Zealand as Radio Forestland, broadcasting on 1420AM with the call sign 1ZO. The station was started in the mid 1970s and in 1978 moved to 1413AM after the frequency spacing on the AM band in New Zealand was changed from 10 kHz to 9 kHz. Local content on the station was limited to mornings only, and outside this time the station broadcast the 1ZH Hamilton programme.

In July 1996 the New Zealand Government sold off the commercial arm of Radio New Zealand, the sale included Radio Forestland. The new owner was The Radio Network, a subsidiary of APN News & Media and Clear Channel Communications, which operated as a division of the Australian Radio Network.

In 1998, Radio Forestland became part of the Community Radio Network with all programming outside of the breakfast show being fed from a central studio originally based in Taupo. In 2001 all Community Radio Network stations became part of the Classic Hits FM network with programming outside of the breakfast show based from Auckland. At this point the station became known as Classic Hits Radio Forestland. In 2013 the local breakfast was replaced with a feed of the breakfast show from Classic Hits in Hamilton.

On April 28, 2014, all stations part of the Classic Hits network were rebranded as The Hits. A networked breakfast presented by Polly Gillespie and Grant Kareama was introduced to almost all The Hits stations with the former breakfast announcer moved to present a 6-hour show between 9am and 3pm. The Hits in South Waikato contains the same local programming as Hamilton.

He was a signatory to the Mayflower Compact, and died with his wife in the first Pilgrim winter in the New World.

Life in England 
John Tilley was baptised on 19 December 1571 at Henlow in Bedfordshire, England. He was the eldest child of Robert Tilley and his wife Elizabeth. John had a younger brother, Edward, who also came on the Mayflower with his wife. John Tilley, his brother Edward and their wives all perished that first winter in the New World.

There are few records of John Tilley's life in England. His name appears in the will of George Clarke of Henlow, dated 22 September 1607, which notes that Thomas Kirke, then residing with Tilley, owed money to him. There is a record of a John Tilley, yeoman, residing at Wooton, Bedfordshire, who made a disposition on 7 April 1613 with his age stated as 40 years, which would probably make him the Mayflower passenger of that name.

Additionally, October 1617 Robert Tilley was apprenticed by his father John Tilley to Bedford tailor John Jones for eight years.  (This information was also printed in The Howland Quarterly Howland Quarterly v71 #1 Mar 2006, “The Tilley’s of England and New England: Part 1” by Gail Ann Adams.)

Robert Tylly son of John and Joan was baptized 25 Nov 1604 in Henlow. Nearby Bedford was the residence of Joan Rogers Hawkins, Robert’s half sister (from his mother Joan’s first marriage). Joan Rogers married Edward Hawkins in St Paul church in Bedford 27 Jun 1620. Robert married Edward’s sister Mary at the same church in 27 Jun 1632. 

It has been suggested that John Tilley moved at some point prior to 1620 to Leiden, Netherlands with the Pilgrims (or “saints” as Plymouth Governor William Bradford later referred to them). This is called into question if he arranged an apprenticeship for his son in Bedfordshire in Oct 1617. It’s possible that Robert aged 12 was living with a guardian in Oct 1617 or perhaps John travelled back from Leiden to arrange the apprenticeship.

There is evidence that Edward Tilley, John’s brother, agreed to take on an apprentice for five years in Leiden 25 Apr 1618. This apprentice did not travel on the Speedwell or Mayflower, so perhaps the agreement was set aside.

If John Tilley was not with Pilgrims in Leiden, then he would have been one of Bradford's ""strangers"" who joined the expedition in Southampton where the Mayflower met up with the Speedwell in July 1620. (The Speedwell having left Leiden 22 July with Pilgrims on-board. It was abandoned at Plymouth on 27 August after multiple attempts to repair leaks failed and the ship was deemed not safe to make the crossing.) 

There is little information about the lives of John Tilley and his wife Joan.  John Tilley was documented as a member of the Leiden Separatist congregation as well as his brother Edward. Edward's ward Henry Samson may also have been a member.

On the Mayflower and in the New World 
 
Per William Bradford's later recollection of this family on the Mayflower: ""John Tillie, and his wife; and Elizabeth, their daughter.""

The Mayflower departed Plymouth, England on 6/16 September 1620. The small, 100-foot ship had 102 passengers and a crew of about 30–40 in extremely cramped conditions. By the second month out, the ship was being buffeted by strong westerly gales, causing the ship's timbers to be badly shaken with caulking failing to keep out sea water, and with passengers, even in their berths, lying wet and ill. This, combined with a lack of proper rations and unsanitary conditions for several months, attributed to what would be fatal for many, especially the majority of women and children.  On the way there were two deaths, a crew member and a passenger, but the worst was yet to come after arriving at their destination when, in the space of several months, almost half the passengers perished in cold, harsh, unfamiliar New England winter.

On 9/19 November 1620, after about three months at sea, including a month of delays in England, they spotted land, which was the Cape Cod Hook, now called Provincetown Harbor. After several days of trying to get south to their planned destination of the Colony of Virginia, strong winter seas forced them to return to the harbour at Cape Cod hook, where they anchored on 11/21 November. The Mayflower Compact was signed that day. John Tilley was a signatory to the Mayflower Compact, as was his brother, Edward.

In the New World 
Both John Tilley and his brother Edward were involved in the early exploring expeditions of the Cape Cod area in November and December 1620, with both suffering the effects of being ill-clad and wet in freezing temperatures. It may be that they died from the effects of the exploration weather.

One such extensive exploration in which the John and Edward Tilley are named as having taken part began on Wednesday, 6 December 1620 in freezing weather using the ship's shallop – a light, shallow-water boat with oars and sails navigated by two pilots and crewed by a master gunner and two sailors. The Pilgrims on board for this expedition, in addition to the Tilleys, were John Howland, Stephen Hopkins and his servant Edward Doty. Senior members on the expedition included John Carver, William Bradford, militia captain Myles Standish and Edward Winslow. The number of persons on this exploration was less than half of a prior expedition due to many having been felled by illness. As was recorded: ""...very cold and hard weather... in which time two were sick... the gunner also sick unto death.."" This exploration would not turn out well for the English in their first encounter with Indians as they found that slow-firing muskets were no match for rapid-fire arrows. This Indian challenge to the Pilgrims was later known as the ""First Encounter.""

John Tilley and his wife Joan both died the first winter, as did his brother Edward and his wife Ann. The only Tilley surviving from the Mayflower was John's thirteen-year-old daughter, Elizabeth, who went on to marry John Howland and raise a large family.

Family and children 
John Tilley married Joan (Hurst) Rogers, widow of Thomas Rogers (no relation to the Mayflower passenger of that name) on 20 September 1596 at Henlow in Bedfordshire. Joan Hurst was the younger daughter of William Hurst, and was baptised on 13 March 1567/8 at Henlow making her a little older than John. Joan came to the marriage with a daughter Joan, born of her marriage to Thomas Rogers, whom she married on 18 June 1593. Joan was baptised 26 May 1594, and Rogers seems to have died shortly afterwards.

Child of Joan (Hurst) and Thomas Rogers
Joan Rogers was baptised on 26 May 1594. There is no further record and she may have died young, likely sometime after her mother's 1596 marriage to John Tilley. Updated from Bedfordshire local parish records, Joan Rogers relocated to the county town of Bedford. Joan Rogers married Edward Hawkins 27 June 1620 in Bedford, Bedfordshire, England where they continued to live and raise a family.
 
Children of John and Joan Tilley – all baptised in Henlow, Bedfordshire

They had five children baptised in the parish of Henlow between 1597 and 1607. Of their children, only Elizabeth, baptised 30 August 1607, and who accompanied them on the Mayflower, is a known survivor. The fate of the others is unknown.

 Rose Tilley (1) was baptised on 23 October 1597 and may have died young. No further record.
 John Tilley was baptised on 26 August 1599, died 1636 in Saybrook, New Haven, Connecticut, British Colony
 Rose Tilley (2) was baptised on 28 February 1601/2 and may have died young. No further record.
 Robert Tilley was baptised on 25 November 1604 and may have died young. No further record. Updated from Bedfordshire local parish records, their son Robert Tilley and his half sister Joan Rogers from Joan Hurst‘s first marriage, relocated 13 miles from Henlow to Bedford, where Robert Tilley became a Tailor’s apprentice. Joan married Edward and Robert married Mary both from the same Hawkins family who came from Bedford.
Robert Tilley married Mary Hawkins (who was born in Bedford in 1605) on 1 November 1632 at St. Paul’s Church, Bedford, England. Their first child, Mary Tilley was baptised on 11 August 1633 in St. Mary’s parish Bedford, England. Robert Tilley died 8 November 1639 in Bedford, Bedfordshire, England.   
 Elizabeth Tilley was baptised on 30 August 1607 and died in Swansea on 22 December 1687. She married John Howland in Plymouth Colony about 1624 and had ten children.

Elizabeth (Tilley) Howland's family is described in a later recollection of William Bradford: (Gov. Carver's) ""..servant John Howland, married the doughter of John Tillie, Elizabeth, and they are both now living, and have *10* children, now all living; and their eldest daughter hath *4* children. And ther *2* daughter, one, all living; and other of their children mariagable. So *15* are come of them.""

Death, burial and memorial of John Tilley and wife Joan 
William Bradford described the demise of John and Joan Tilley: ""John Tillie and his wife both dyed a little after they came ashore; and their daughter Elizabeth married with John Howland, and had issue as is before noted.""

John and Joan Tilley died sometime in the winter of 1620/1621, possibly after coming ashore, per Bradford, to the new Plymouth settlement. They were buried in Cole's Hill Burial Ground in Plymouth, most likely in unmarked graves as with so many who died in that first winter. Their names, along with others who perished that winter, are memorialised on the Pilgrim Memorial Tomb on Cole's Hill as ""John Tilley and his wife.""

Crittenton. It attempted to reform prostitutes and unwed pregnant women through the creation of establishments where they were to live and learn skills.

History
The first of the organization's homes was located in New York City. Seven years later, in 1890, the second Florence Crittenton Home was opened in San Jose, California. Shortly thereafter, pioneering female physician Dr. Kate Waller Barrett joined Charles Crittenton as the driving force behind the organization and helped expand the Crittenton movement into a network of affiliated homes that at its peak included 76 homes across the U.S., in addition to homes in China, France, Japan and Mexico.

This turn of the 20th century social welfare movement helped shape the professionalization of social work, and changed social attitudes about motherhood and the role of women in society. Dr. Barrett's views on the education and training of women were considered radical at the time, but these ideas were adopted into the services provided to young women and girls at many Crittenton homes.

A special act of Congress in 1898, signed by President McKinley, granted a national charter in perpetuity to the National Florence Crittenton Mission, and was the first U.S. national charter ever given to a charitable organization. The headquarters of the national mission was in Washington, D. C.  The largest work of the mission was carried out in New York City.

In 1950, there were two organizations associated with the original mission: the National Florence Crittenton Mission and the Florence Crittenton Homes Association, which had its headquarters in Chicago, Illinois. In 1976, the Florence Crittenton Association of America merged with the Child Welfare League of America. The Florence Crittenton Mission continued to provide financial support to the Crittenton Division of the Child Welfare League.

In 2006, The National Florence Crittenton Mission adopted a new name: The National Crittenton Foundation. The organization separated from the Child Welfare League of America and returned to being a stand-alone organization affiliated with dozens of Crittenton-affiliated agences around the country. The National Crittenton Foundation's headquarters are located in Portland, Oregon.

Past criticism
The National Florence Crittenton Mission's approach to adoption and to unwed pregnancy has been criticized largely due to policies used decades ago. In the past, rather than to aid pregnant women, families sent them to Crittenton homes to hide them from public view and avoid shame. Women in these homes were required to give up their children for adoption. The coercive practices of these homes were detailed in The Girls Who Went Away. This mirrored a practice found in Europe generally and in Italy specifically occurring from the Middle Ages to its full flowering in the 19th century. (See Kertzer, David I. Sacrificed for Honor: Italian Infant Abandonment and the Politics of Reproductive Control. Boston: Beacon Press, 1993.)

He was the president and founder of Elite Hotels of Sweden and The Bishop's Arms. He was counted as one of the richest men in Scandinavia.

Biography
Chakraborty came to Sweden from Calcutta, India in 1966 to study Sociology at the University of Stockholm. He saw that student dormitories were empty over the summer and began pushing the dorm Domus as a discount hotel to rent out those who were located near Stureplan in Stockholm. Chakraborty managed to acquire these properties from the student association in private hands and they became due plate in his hotel empire. Later he went on to buy the rundown city hotel (sv) and rehabilitate it. In 1980, he bought Hotel in London, a historic city hotel from 1858. At this time there were several run down city hotels around the country. Swedish hospitality was most focused on motels near urban areas. Chakraborty saw this opportunity to revive the ancient city hotel tradition, but in a more modern form. Bicky Chakraborty owned and operated the hotel chain Elite (sv), which covers several historically important city hotels in the country, including Hotel Knaust (sv) in Sundsvall, Hotel Mollberg (sv) in Helsingborg, Hotel Savoy (sv) in Malmö and the City Hotel in Västerås. Bicky Chakraborty's hotel business is the only Swedish-owned hotel chain in Sweden.

Awards and recognition
In 2008, Chakraborty was awarded the Royal Patriotic Society Business Medal for having contributed to the development of Swedish industry. He was also the winner of the Pravasi Bharatiya Samman awarded by the Government of India. Chakraborty was also member of the Jönköping University Foundation.

Personal life
Chakraborty married Ylva Lindberg, the sister of Princess Marianne Bernadotte.

963,"['The fort defend the Coled de Jougne at Vallorbe , one of the few points in the Jura that could be easily traversable by an invading force .']","The Fort de Pré-Giroud, also known as the Fort de Vallorbe, is a 20th-century Swiss fortification located in the Jura Mountains near the Swiss border with France. The fort defended the Col de Jougne at Vallorbe, one of the few points in the Jura that could be easily traversable by an invading force. It was a component of the Swiss Border Line of defenses. Built between 1937 and 1939, the fort covers the Swiss end on the Mont d'Or railroad tunnel and the Joux valley. It is armed with three artillery blocks for 75mm guns and two machine gun blocks.  All are camouflaged, the artillery blocks as rock formations, and the machine gun blocks as houses. Deactivated as a military post in the 1980s, it is operated as a museum.

Description
The Fort de Pré-Giroud is located to the east of Vallorbe, in a steep hillside facing north, towards the Jougnes gap. It is part of the Border Line defenses built by Switzerland in the late 1930s, prior to a shift in Swiss priorities to the National Redoubt in the Alps.

The fort is laid out in a roughly triangular shape, with the base of the triangle at the bottom of the steep slope. Three multi-level artillery casemates containing 75mm guns are located near the middle, flanked by machine gun blocks. To the rear, deeply buried in the hillside, are ammunition magazines, utility areas and underground barracks. The barracks are at a depth of . The main fort is surrounded by four smaller bunkers, unconnected to the main fort system.

Armament includes:
 C1: casemate with one 75mm Model 1939 semi-automatic gun
 C2: casemate with one 75mm gun, one 47mm semi-automatic anti-tank gun, observation post
 C3: as C1
 M1: machine gun casemate with one 7.5mm Model 1911 water-cooled gun, observation post and emergency exit
 M2: machine gun casemate with two machine guns
 M3: as M2
 M4: as M1
The perimeter blockhouses are each armed with two machine guns. Infantry for exterior protection were further armed with 24, and 47mm anti-tank weapons, two 81mm mortars, four machine guns and eight automatic rifles. These were added in 1941, along with barbed-wire entanglements, stated to be lessons learned from the successful German assault on the Belgian Fort Eben-Emael. 

The machine gun blocks are covered by wood superstructures in the shape of chalets, while the artillery blocks are covered in rough rock-shaped shells, with metal branch-like camouflage. Unlike contemporary French fortifications of the Maginot Line, which are sited to avoid prominent exposures and which are positioned to fire obliquely, along the defensive lines, the Pré-Giroud fort is relatively exposed and fires directly ahead.

The fort was manned by more than 200 men.

Present situation
The Fort de Pré-Giroud was decommissioned in the 1980s, on grounds that its levels of protection and armament were inadequate and obsolete. It was sold in 1988. It is now operated as a museum.

It includes the title track single which became the biggest hit of Brooks' career. Both the album and single peaked at No. 5 on the UK charts in early 1987.

Overview
Having been released from her contract with A&M Records in early 1986, Brooks struck a new deal with smaller label Legend Records, which was distributed by Island. Impressed with their enthusiasm and willingness to promote this new album, Brooks was excited about the project and worked with songwriter Russ Ballard who had had a number of hits to his credit. Ballard had been working on a song called ""No More the Fool"" which he had earmarked for Kim Wilde, but on hearing it, Brooks' husband and engineer Trevor Jordan instantly claimed the song for her. Ballard wrote some other songs for the album, while Brooks composed two as well as choosing cover versions of ""We've Got Tonight"" and ""Only Women Bleed"". The album was completed by ""Hold the Dream"" which had been the theme to the TV mini-series of the same name.

Gathering together a team of trusted musicians, Brooks recorded the album at her home studio in North Devon, except for the title track which was recorded at Ballard's own studios. It was recorded during May and June 1986 just as Brooks discovered she was pregnant. Because of this, pre-promotion was pulled forward to October with live and personal appearances being undertaken while heavily pregnant, Legend Records meanwhile heralded the album with advertising on buses and in tube stations. 
   
Released a month later, the album marked the peak of Brooks' career. The lead single ""No More the Fool"" was a big comeback hit for her, reaching No.5 in the UK Singles Chart in January 1987. This album also reached No. 5 at the same time, while a compilation album, The Very Best of Elkie Brooks, was at No. 10 in the charts. Brooks had given birth in late December and therefore was back to performing on TV including appearances on Top of the Pops soon afterwards. A promotional tour in Germany was also undertaken at this time. Brooks later recalled that having a baby boy at this time meant that she did not fully appreciate the success she was experiencing. Two more singles were released from the album, a remixed version of ""Break the Chain"" and ""We've Got Tonight"", which became more modest hits peaking at numbers 55 and 69 respectively. No More the Fool remained on the UK album chart for 23 weeks.

A cruel twist emerged from the album however as when 18 months later Brooks was to release the follow-up album, she discovered that despite huge earnings from the album, she still had not received any royalties. Looking into it, the profits showed up as zero. The record company had shipped production of the album out to Germany, which then linked to a separate account held in Panama, meaning that the UK account of the record company showed only a debt of £132,000 in recording costs. To add to this, Legend Records later sold the rights to Polydor Records for £500,000 - which was declared at covering the cost of recording and other extras. Brooks looked into the matter with solicitors but reluctantly bowed down due to the cost of legal proceedings against the chances of winning. She later remarked ""This was the business end of it, which I've always hated and I still do to this day"". Although aware that these things happen quite often in the music business, she declared that the artist is an innocent party and ""it should be stopped because it's totally wrong"".

Tracks from the album (along with the follow-up) have been re-issued several times on various compilation CDs (Original Recordings in 1993, Love Is Love in 1994, We've Got Tonight four times and No More the Fool twice).

In 2003, a compilation album with the same title was released by Delta Music on compact disc at a budget price following Brooks' appearance on ITV's Reborn in the USA.

The practice of collecting pearl shells existed well before European settlement. Coastal dwelling Aboriginal people had collected and traded pearl shell as well as trepang and tortoise with fisherman from Sulawesi for possibly hundreds of years.  After settlement, Aboriginal people were used as slave labour in the emerging commercial industry in a practice known as blackbirding.  Pearling centred first around Nickol Bay and Exmouth Gulf and then around Broome, to become the largest in the world by 1910.

The farming of cultured pearls remains an important part of the Kimberley economy, worth  million in 2014 and is the second largest fisheries industry in Western Australia after rock lobster.

History

The first stage of the European pearling industry: Wading for shell  

Pearls were first gathered in Western Australia by Aboriginal Australians. The European pearling industry began in the 1850s at Shark Bay where pearls (called the  'Oriental, or Golden' Pearl)  were found in the Pinctada albina oyster in relatively large numbers. The industry soon folded however.

At Nickol Bay, decorative pearl shells (Riji) made by local Aborigines from Pinctada maxima, were noted by European explorers. The industry began in the mid-1860s with pastoral workers who collected shell in shallow waters, either from shore or in small boats. In 1866, a former shareholder of the defunct Denison Plains Company, WF Tays (who apparently had some prior knowledge of pearling) proved very successful as a full-time pearler. Others followed and in these instances, the boat provided transport for personnel and shell to and from remote beds, or across deeper water to drying banks and reefs. There was no diving at this time, as the shallow waters initially provided enormous returns to the Europeans and their Aboriginal labourers, who waded and recovered shell as the tide receded.

During the late 1860s many more boats left Fremantle and the pearling industry at Torres Strait, Queensland for the new fishery at Nickol Bay with its port of Tien Tsin Harbour (later known as Cossack). Walter Padbury, the noted Perth-based merchant, pastoralist and ship owner, then sent a large boat north up to the early pastoralist John Withnell in partnership with others. They also proved successful, as did many others, including (to name but a few) Charles Harper, who built his own boat, the Amateur; Charles Edward Broadhurst a noted entrepreneur and at least two sons of Government Resident RJ Sholl.

This led the industry into its second stage and a transition took place from wading in the shallows into the use of ""skin divers"" (unassisted by the emerging technology of breathing apparatus). In most cases, however, the transition from wading to diving took place during 1868. While Broadhurst and a few other proprietors experimented, during the 1860s, with the use of breathing apparatus by professional divers, it proved at the time to be expensive, unreliable and dangerous.

While local Aborigines were excellent swimmers, known to have covered great distances over water, sometimes to escape imprisonment, unlike their counterparts in some other parts of Australia they had no cause to dive in conditions where the tidal range provided all they needed. Many were also succumbing to diseases to which they had not previously been exposed, as well as accidents. This led to recruitment from the convicts on the ""Native Prison"" on Rottnest Island. Broadhurst was criticised for harsh treatment of at least one indigenous employee, while some pearlers abducted and/or forcibly retained their divers.

Experiments with  alternative labour sources and with Diving Apparatus (The 'Hard Hat' )
In the meantime, 'naked diving' continued with most producing exceptional results, especially at the Flying Foam Passage where they used the tides to allow themselves to travel over great distances. As the demands on the local Aboriginal populations increased, many died due to disease and maltreatment.

The Shark Bay pearling industry   
Frank Cadell was also operating at Shark Bay in this period and in this era 'dredging' rapidly became  the most efficient means of obtaining the shell, which was noted more for the pearls rather than the shell as was the  situation further north.  When SS Xantho sank beneath him late in 1872, Broadhurst joined Cadell at Shark Bay there, proving extremely successful at one stage recovering over 200 ounces of pearls. The publicity  surrounding the successes resulted in a virtual gold rush centred on  Wilyah Miah (Place of the Pearl).

The Broome era
'Diving apparatus' (standard dress or 'hard hat') was used. Soon the Japanese divers came to dominate the industry. By 1910, nearly 400 pearling luggers and more than 3500 people were fishing for shell in waters around Broome, making it the world's largest pearling centre. The majority of the workers were Japanese and Malaysian, but also included were Chinese, Filipino, Amborese, Koepanger (Timorese) and Makassan, as well as Indigenous Australians and people from Europe.

In 1910, two schooners from Koepang were reported to be at work harvesting beche-de-mer near the Walcott Inlet, within Collier Bay, after a ""phantom ship"" had been spotted off Cape Farquhar some days before.

By the 1930s, pearl luggers were mainly motorised and the use of mechanical air pumps allowed boats to use two divers.  The industry suffered from a high death toll, with hazards from shark attack, cyclones and frequently, the bends.  Four tropical cyclones hit the area between 1908 and 1935 and over 100 boats and 300 people were lost during that time, as evidenced by the numerous graves in the Japanese cemetery in Broome.

At the time of the World War I the price of mother-of-pearl plummeted with the invention and expanded use of plastics for buttons and other articles which had previously been made of shell. Broome had been the centre of an industry that supplied up to 70% of global demand for the shell.  Concerns regarding over-harvesting by the industry led to the voluntary Northern Territory Pearling Ordinance in 1931. Pearlers such as Jiro Muramats continued to operate out of Cossack.  By 1939 only 73 luggers and 565 people were left in the industry and during the World War II, pearling virtually stopped. Japanese divers discreetly went home or were interned and Broome was bombed, destroying many of the remaining luggers. After the war, as few as 15 boats employing around 200 people remained.

Post WW2: indentured labour
After World War II, workers were brought from Malaya and Indonesia on bonds to work in the pearl shelling industry and returned to their country of origin when no longer needed. Sumatran-born Samsudin bin Katib was a pearl diver who was recruited and deployed in the Z Special Unit Commandos in the Australian Army and worked behind enemy lines. Returning to work in Broome, Samsudin protested at a 10% cut in wages and poor conditions for the migrant labourers, organising a general strike. He also applied to be allowed permanent residence, but this was against the provisions of the White Australia policy. Despite the backing of some unions and individuals, he was deported in 1948.

Legacy of the 19th century

In April 2019, the skeletons of 14 Yawuru and Karajarri people which had been sold in 1894 by a wealthy Broome pastoralist and pearler to a museum in Dresden, Germany, were brought home. The remains, which had been stored in the Grassi Museum of Ethnology in Leipzig, showed signs of head wounds and malnutrition, a reflection of the poor conditions endured by Aboriginal people forced to work on the pearl luggers.

Pearling luggers
The boats used for pearling from the 1870s, known as pearling luggers, were unique to Australia. There were at least two types: the Broome or North-West lugger, and the Thursday Island or Torres Strait lugger. The styles are each adapted to their respective areas and modus operandi. Around Broome, the boats had to cope with the extreme tidal range and the shallow sandy shore, on which they had to spend extended periods lying on their sides. The Torres Strait luggers spent longer periods at sea, based around schooners as mother ships.

The design of these two types changed after the engines were developed for the boats, and over time they began to look more alike.  The last of the pearling luggers were built in the 1950s, and were over  long. They were some of the last wooden sailing vessels in commercial use in Australia.

Michael Gregg, curator of maritime history at the Western Australian Museum says there were four different types, and also pointed out that the Broome pearling lugger was not actually a lugger. The name derived from the first boats used for pearling in Australia, which were often ship's boats, and used a lugsail, and so they were called luggers. But as boats began to be designed specifically for pearling, they kept the name luggers though they stopped using lugsails, and were actually gaff-rigged ketches.

At the peak of the pearling industry, in the early 1900s, there were 350 to 400 pearling luggers operating out of Broome each year. By 2005, there were just two still afloat in Broome. In 2007, one of them, Ida Lloyd, sank off Cable Beach, and in 2015, Intombi, built in 1903, was burnt. However as of 2019, there were still about 40 luggers of various types still afloat around Australia, and there is a collection of luggers at the Australian National Maritime Museum.

Cultured pearls
Due to the prospect of an adverse reaction in the natural pearling industry, the Australian government through the Pearling Act 1922 prohibited anyone in Australia from artificially producing cultivated pearls.  The Act was repealed in 1949.  In 1956, a joint Japanese-Australian venture was set up at Kuri Bay,  north of Broome as a cultured pearl farm, named Pearls Proprietary Ltd. The company was owned by Male and Co, Broome Pearlers Brown and Dureau Ltd, and the Otto Gerdau Company (New York). The Japanese-owned Nippo Pearl Company handled distribution and marketing. The principal was Tokuichi Kuribayashi (1896–1982) who became highly influential following the death of Kōkichi Mikimoto (1858–1954). Mikimoto, Kuribayashi and another man, Tatsuhei Mise (1880–1924) had all been involved in the invention of cultured pearls around 1900.  Kuri Bay was named after Mr Kuribayashi.

By 1981, there were five pearl farms operational: Kuri Bay, Port Smith, Cygnet Bay, and two in Broome's Roebuck Bay.

The industry today includes 19 of Australia's 20 cultured pearl farms and generates annual exports of  million and employs approximately 1000 people.

Etymology
The specific epithet refers to the pubescent (downy) hairs on the outer surface of the spathe.

At least one seed vendor has used the name broom jelly palm for this species.

Taxonomy
Butia pubispatha was discovered, and the type specimen and live plants collected, by Harri Lorenzi and Kelen Pureza Soares in 2008. In 2009 Lorenzi was growing and studying the plants in his Plantarum Institute  and Larry R. Noblick and Lorenzi described B. catarinensis, B. matogrossensis and B. pubispatha in 2010 in the Flora brasileira: Arecaceae (palmeiras) by Lorenzi et al. (Noblick also described B. lepidotispatha in 2010).

Description
This is a palm with a solitary, underground trunk 5-20cm in diameter. The trunk is usually subterranean, but it may occasionally breach the ground with age. 

It has 4-13 leaves; these have a 5-18cm long unarmed petiole which has margins fringed with fibres. The rachis of the leaf is 25-65cm long and has 16-28 pairs of pinnae (leaflets) arranged regularly down its length and inserted in a single plane per side of the leaf, a pair of pinnae thus forming a neat 'V'-shape. The pinnae in the middle of the leaf blade are 20-32cm long and 0.4-1cm wide. In the wild the leaves are recorded as coloured greyish-green, the petioles yellowish. In cultivation the leaves are bluish-green, and young leaves are very finely coated in a white wax. 

The inflorescence is branched to a single degree. The developing inflorescence is protected within a 20-33cm long spathe with an enlarged portion which is 10-18cm long and 1.4-3cm wide. The spathe is coloured green, has a woody consistency and the outer surface is covered in short, rusty-coloured, pubescent (downy) hairs that fall off easily and as the spathe matures. The inflorescence is finely coated in pale-coloured wax. The rachis of the inflorescence is only 1-4cm long, with 1-5 rachillae (branches) which are 6-15cm long. The flowers are coloured purple or purplish-yellow. The staminate (male) flowers are 9mm long; the pistillate (female), 7-8 by 7-8mm. 

The ripe fruit are coloured greenish-purple, ovoid-shaped, 2-2.5cm long and 1.8-2.9cm wide. The flesh is yellow and sweet-sour. The nut within is hard, 1.5-1.8cm long and 1-1.2cm wide, and usually contains a single seed. The shape of the nut has been said to be ovoid or elliptic-shaped, or globose (round).

The plants look like a clump of grass.

Similar species
Soares considers it most similar to Butia microspadix, differing from that species by the spathes being covered in short pubescent hairs that fall off, whereas those of B. microspadix have long and persistent hairs upon their stem. It also grows much faster and is more robust than B. microspadix.

In a key to the genus provided in 2014, Noblick contrasts it to B. marmorii, but the spathe in that species is papery, smooth or scaly, and the inflorescence has a much shorter peduncle and rachillae.

It grows in the same region as B. eriospatha and B. microspadix.

Distribution & habitat
This plant is extremely rare. As of 2017 it has not been found anywhere except the type locality in the east of the state of Paraná in southeastern Brazil. It was discovered and collected in 2008 along a highway in the municipality of Jaguariaíva.

It grows in sunny high altitude grassland, near a river, in sandy soils.

Cultivation
Seeds have been offered for sale. It has been grown by at least two collectors as of 2014.

Conservation
As of 2018 the Centro Nacional de Conservação da Flora has not yet rated the conservation status for Brazil, and it is listed as 'not evaluated'. It was grown ex situ in the Jardim Botânico Plantarum in Nova Odessa, São Paulo, Brazil, by 2009. As of 2017 the locality is protected within a conservation area, the geological park Área de Preservação Ambiental da Escarpa Devoniana, but much of the nearby area has been converted to soya cultivation.

This species is extremely rare, the least known of the Brazilian Butia species, known only from a single locality and rarely grown in cultivation. It is so rare or little studied that in a 2017 study attempting to calculate population abundance it was deemed 'data deficient' (along with B. witeckii, which has been collected in two localities).

History 
It is the first composition he entered into a notebook of his music he then kept for the next seven years, marking down main themes, dates of completion, and other important information. From this notebook we have the information that he completed the concerto on February 9, 1784.

In the same year, he wrote several concertos in succession, and in a letter to his father that May, wrote of the 15th and 16th concertos (K. 450 and 451) that he ""could not choose between them"" but that ""the one in E flat [No. 14] does not belong at all to the same category. It is one of a quite peculiar kind..."". The 14th is regarded as being the first of the mature series of concertos Mozart wrote, and indeed, commentators such as Girdlestone and Hutchings valued it as one of the best, particularly as all three movements are of the highest standard.

Movements

This concerto has three movements:

Works written in 1784 include, besides this concerto, the five piano concertos 15–19,  the Quintet in E for Piano and Winds, and several piano works – the Sonata in C minor being the most noteworthy—one string quartet (the ""Hunt""), and several sets of orchestral dances. Works by other composers who were known to Mozart from around this time include the 80th symphony (in D minor) and second cello concerto of Joseph Haydn. Michael Haydn had published two sets of quartets the year before, and Carl Stamitz and Ignaz Pleyel each wrote another set of six quartets (Pleyel released a further set in 1784.) A Pleyel cello concerto (in C) was also released at some point between 1782–84 (Pleyel being a composer whose quartets, at least, Mozart rated highly.)

I. Allegro vivace

The first movement begins in a  time signature, an unusual feature among Mozart's 27 piano concertos. Among them only this, the fourth, the eleventh, and twenty-fourth open with a movement in . It is also traditional, in the tutti of a classical concerto, for there to be little key adventuring.  There are several reasons for this, but the upshot is that, the less this is true, the harder it becomes to distinguish the tutti from the opening of a classical-era symphony.

The first phrase of this concerto begins ambiguously. A unison E followed by a C, then a G, is followed by the dominant chord's leading tone (A) trilled up to the dominant, B. It's interesting that this progression seems to suggest a dominant cadence in the dominant key of B. In other words, Cmin to F to B (ii – V – I in B). There is an immediate modulation, through a fiery C-minor passage, into B major. Here a possible second theme is heard, played by strings, winds not coming in until its later strain (near the modulation back into E).

Also interesting about this concerto is that the first movement ventures off from the normal conception of the concerto. Usually, when it comes time for the cadenza at the end of the recapitulation, the soloists will have a cadential trill on the tonic after which the orchestra will play part of the ritornello leading to the I 6/4 at which point the soloists performs the cadenza.  However, instead of the trill being accompanied by strings, it is interrupted by them on the second beat and ends up resolving to c minor.  Shortly thereafter, however, the I arrives and the cadenza begins and everything continues on as normal.

III. Allegro ma non troppo
Girdlestone (p 187, Mozart and his Piano Concertos) writes that the gait of this finale is ""neither that of a gallop, nor of a race, nor even of a dance, but just of a swinging walk, swift and regular, and the virtue of its refrain, with its sketchy outline and its 'sillabato' diction... rests in its rhythm rather than in its melody."" Further, he notes that while this rondo can be divided into contrasting sections, the appearance on the page is very different from what falls on the ear, which is almost monothematic: ""When, score in hand, one notes each return of the first subject... it is possible to pick out the four expositions of the [rondo] refrain and the three couplets... but on hearing it one's impression is that the refrain never leaves the stage"".

Historically part of Cheshire, it is  east of Manchester city centre and  north-west of Glossop.

When a water-powered cotton mill was constructed in 1776, Stalybridge became one of the first centres of textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution. The wealth created in the 19th century from the factory-based cotton industry transformed an area of scattered farms and homesteads into a self-confident town.

History

Early history
The earliest evidence of human activity in Stalybridge is a flint scraper from the late Neolithic/early Bronze Age. Also bearing testament to the presence of man in prehistory are the Stalybridge cairns. The two monuments are on the summit of Hollingworthall Moor   apart. One of the round cairns is the best-preserved Bronze Age monument in Tameside, and is protected as a scheduled monument. A branch of the Roman road between the forts at Manchester (Mamucium) and Melandra Castle (Ardotalia) is thought to run through Stalybridge to the fort of Castleshaw.

The settlement was originally called Stavelegh, which derives from the Old English , meaning ""wood where the staves are got"". The medieval Lords of the manor took de Stavelegh as their name, later becoming Stayley or Staley. The lordship of Longdendale was one of the ancient feudal estates of Cheshire and included the area of Stalybridge. Buckton Castle, near Stalybridge, was probably built by one of the earls of Chester in the 12th century. William de Neville was the first lord of Longdendale, appointed by the Earl of Chester between 1162 and 1186. The lordship of Longdendale included the manors of Staley, Godley, Hattersley, Hollingworth, Matley, Mottram, Newton, Tintwistle and Werneth; the manor of Staley was first mentioned between 1211 and 1225.

The first records of the de Stavelegh family as Lords of the Manor of Staley date from the early 13th century. Staley Hall was their residence. The present hall was built in the late 16th century on the same site as an earlier hall of the Stayley family which dated from before 1343.

Sir Ralph Staley (descendant of the de Stavelegh family) had no male heirs but an only daughter, Elizabeth Staley, who married Sir Thomas Assheton and united the manors of Ashton and Staley. Elizabeth and Thomas had two daughters and no sons. Margaret, the eldest of their two daughters, married Sir William Booth of Dunham Massey. The younger daughter Elizabeth was widowed and without children, and continued to live at Staley Hall until her death in 1553. In her will her share of the lordships of Staley and Ashton were left to the Booths.

The manor of Staley remained in the possession of the Booth family until the death of George Booth, 2nd Earl of Warrington on 2 August 1758. Upon his death, the Earldom of Warrington became extinct. His only daughter, Lady Mary Booth, the wife of Harry Grey, 4th Earl of Stamford, inherited all the Booth estates. The manor of Staley was owned by the Grey family until the extinction of the Earldom of Stampford on the death of Roger Grey, 10th Earl of Stamford in 1976. At this point, the family estates were dispersed. Stamford Street, Grey Street, Groby Street, Stamford Park, Stamford Golf Club and the two Stamford Arms public houses in Stalybridge are all named after the Grey family.

Industrial Revolution

As Stayley expanded in the 18th century, it reached the banks of the River Tame. After the construction of a bridge in 1707, the settlement was commonly referred to as Stalybridge, meaning the bridge at Stayley. By the mid-18th century Stalybridge had a population of just 140. Farming and woolen spinning were the main means of subsistence at this time.

In 1776, the town's first water-powered mill for carding and spinning cotton was built at Rassbottom. In 1789, the town's first spinning mill using the principle of Arkwright's Water Frame was built. By 1793, steam power had been introduced to the Stalybridge cotton industry; by 1803 there were eight cotton mills in the growing town containing 76,000 spindles. The Huddersfield Narrow Canal was completed in 1811 and still runs through the town.

The rapid growth of industry in Stalybridge was due to the introduction of machinery. This was, however, met with violent opposition. After the arrival of the Luddites in the area the doors of mills were kept locked day and night. Military aid was requested by the mill owners and a Scottish regiment under the Duke of Montrose was sent to the town. It was led by Captain Raines who made his headquarters at the Roe Cross Inn. Gangs of armed men destroyed power looms and fired mills. The disturbances in Stalybridge culminated with a night of violent rioting on 20 April 1812.

The social unrest did not curb the growth of Stalybridge. By 1814, there were twelve factories and, by 1818, the number had increased to sixteen. The Industrial Revolution led to a rapid increase in the town's population in the early part of the 19th century. The population of the town by 1823 was 5,500. In the following two years, partly because of an influx of Irish families seeking better wages, the population rose to 9,000. Stalybridge was among the first wave of towns to establish a Mechanics' Institute with a view to educating the growing number of workers. Only a year after the establishment of Manchester Mechanics' Institute, Stalybridge founded an Institute of its own. Its doors opened on 7 September 1825 on Shepley Street with a reading room on Queen Street.

On 9 May 1828, the Stalybridge Police and Market Act received Royal Assent, establishing Stalybridge as an independent town with a board of 21 Commissioners. Every male over the age of 21 who was the occupier of a rateable property under the act was entitled to vote at the election of the Commissioners. On 30 December 1831, Stalybridge Town Hall was officially opened. In 1833, the Commissioners set up the Stalybridge Police Force, the first of its kind in the country. By this year, the population of the town had reached 14,216 with 2.357 inhabited houses.

In 1834, a second bridge was built over the Tame. It was downstream of Staley Bridge and constructed of iron.

The second Chartist petition was presented to Parliament in April 1842. Stalybridge contributed 10,000 signatures. After the rejection of the petition the first general strike began in the coal mines of Staffordshire. The second phase of the strike originated in Stalybridge. A movement of resistance to the imposition of wage cuts in the mills, also known as the Plug Riots, it spread to involve nearly half a million workers throughout Britain and represented the biggest single exercise of working class strength in 19th century Britain. On 13 August 1842, there was a strike at Bayley's Cotton Mill in Stalybridge and roving cohorts of operatives carried the stoppage first to the whole area of Stalybridge and Ashton, then to Manchester, and subsequently to towns adjacent to Manchester, using as much force as was necessary to bring mills to a standstill. The movement remained, to outward appearances, largely non-political. Although the People's Charter was praised at public meetings, the resolutions that were passed at these were in almost all cases merely for a restoration of the wages of 1820, a ten-hour working day, or reduced rents.

In writing The Condition of The Working Class in England (1844), Friedrich Engels used Stalybridge as an example:

... multitudes of courts, back lanes, and remote nooks arise out of [the] confused way of building ... Add to this the shocking filth, and the repulsive effect of Stalybridge, in spite of its pretty surroundings, may be readily imagined.

John Summers first established an iron forge in Stalybridge in the 1840s. Later, he and his sons developed this into a major business and employed over 1,000 local men in their factory, the largest in the town.

The Ashton, Stalybridge and Liverpool Junction Railway Company was formed on 19 July 1844 and the railway was connected to Stalybridge on 5 October 1846. On 9 July 1847, the company was acquired by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway. On 1 August 1849, the Manchester, Stockport and Leeds Railway connected Stalybridge to Huddersfield and later to Stockport. This line later became part of the London and North Western Railway.

The cotton famine
On the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861, the Stalybridge cotton mills rapidly ran short of cotton. Thousands of operatives were laid off. In October 1862, a meeting was held in Stalybridge Town Hall that passed a resolution blaming the Confederate States of America and their actions in the American Civil War, rather than U.S. blockades of seaports, for the cotton famine in Lancashire. By the winter of 1862–63, there were 7,000 unemployed operatives in the town. Only five of the town's 39 factories and 24 machine shops were employing people full-time. Contributions were sent from all over the world for the relief of the cotton operatives in Lancashire; and at one point three-quarters of Stalybridge workers were dependent on relief schemes. By 1863, there were 750 empty houses in the town. A thousand skilled men and women left the town, in what became known as ""The Panic"".

In 1863, the relief committee decided to substitute a system of relief by ticket instead of money. The tickets were to be presented at local grocery shops. An organised resistance was organised culminating on Friday 20 March 1863.

In 1867, Stalybridge was disturbed by the arrival of William Murphy. Records of this man indicate that his sole interest was to sow the seeds of dissent between Roman Catholics, who by this time had grown to significant proportions, and Protestants. He succeeded in this goal only too well for a full year. During 1868, there were a number of violent disturbances and rioting created by this man who described himself as a ""renegade Roman Catholic"". In his lectures to the public, ""pretending to expose the religious practices of the Roman Catholic Church"", he became a master at whipping up a crowd into a frenzy. Newspaper reports of the time told of his common practice of waving a revolver in the air in ""a most threatening manner"". On one occasion, he incited a riot of such proportions that Fr. Daley, the parish priest of St. Peter's, took to the roof of the church to defend it. A man was shot. The parish priest was tried but eventually acquitted at the Quarter Sessions. Following this incident, the community began to settle down and Murphy chose to extend his political activities elsewhere.

In 1867, the Victoria Bridge on Trinity Street was built. Victoria Market Hall was constructed in 1868 and the public baths were opened in May 1870. The baths were presented as a gift to the town by philanthropists and benefactors Robert Platt (1802–1882), born in Stalybridge, and his wife Margaret Platt (1819–1888), born in Salford.

Stalybridge Borough Band was formed in March 1871, holding its first rehearsals and meetings at the Moulder's Arms, Grasscroft Street, Castle Hall. The band was known as the 4th Cheshire Rifleman Volunteers (Borough Band) until 1896. The founder and first conductor was Alexander Owen, who conducted the band until at least 1907.

20th century
The character of Stalybridge altered over the 20th century. At the turn of the century, the cotton industry was still strong, and the population of the town reached its peak in 1901, at 27,623, but as trade dwindled the population began to decline, and despite the intensified employment of the war years, the main industry of Stalybridge continued to fail.
There were floods in Millbrook in May 1906.

Mrs Ada Summers was elected first woman mayor of Stalybridge in November 1919. At that time, mayors of boroughs were justices, as well as chairmen of borough benches, by right of office. However, it was not until the Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act 1919 came into force on 23 December 1919 that women could become magistrates. Sitting ex-officio Ada Summers became the first woman magistrate in the country and was sworn in on 31 December. Ada Summers was, probably, the first woman to officially adjudicate in court. Ada Summers photo appeared in the weekly journal Great Thoughts, 5 June 1920, alongside an interview on ""The First Woman JP"" on her work. Ada Summers was the widow of a local ironmaster. She was an active suffragist and Liberal and used her wealth and position to support a number of schemes designed to improve conditions in the town. These included a maternity and child welfare clinic, clinics for the sick and poor and an unofficial employment centre. She later became an alderman and was appointed MBE. On 31 May 1939 she was awarded the Honorary Freedom of the Borough.

In 1929, with no room for expansion at Stalybridge, the Summers sheet rolling and galvanising plants were transferred to Shotton in North Wales, having devastating effects on local employment; the new plant later became a  component in the British Steel Corporation. By 1932, seven of the town's largest mills had closed and unemployment reached 7,000. In 1934, the borough council set up an Industrial Development Committee for the purpose of encouraging new industries to settle in the town. The committee purchased Cheetham's Mill and rented it out to small firms engaged in a wide variety of enterprises. By 1939, unemployment in the town had almost disappeared.

1939–2000
Stalybridge experienced intensive black-out periods and frequent air-raid warning during the Second World War. Bombs dropped by enemy aircraft mainly landed in open country and there were no civilian casualties. On 19 July 1946, King George VI and Queen Elizabeth visited Stalybridge. The town's war memorial was extended after the war, to bear the names of an extra 124 men from the town; it was unveiled on 23 April 1950.

In the post-war period council housing was provided by the local authority as separate council estates. The Buckton Vale estate was built between January 1950 and March 1953, and the Stamford Park estate between January 1953 and January 1955; the Copley estate commenced building in August 1954 and the Ridgehill estate in January 1956.

In 1955, after the adoption of the first post-war slum clearance plan, new housing estates were built to replace the slums and, gradually, redundant textile mills were occupied by firms in the various light industries. New applications of engineering principles, the manufacture of rubber goods, plastics, chemicals and packaging materials were all introduced, as well as the addition of synthetic fibres to the textile trade, reducing unemployment. The plastics industry origin and growth are described by Craig and Bowes  in ""Cotton Mills to Chemical Plants"" (2013).

The early 1970s saw the development of private semi-detached and detached housing estates, particularly in the Mottram Rise, Hough Hill, Hollins and Carrbrook areas; the redevelopment of Castle Hall was also completed. The construction of the Buckton Vale overspill estate also took place in the early 1970s.

The early 1980s saw the closure of the public baths after the completion of Copley Recreation Centre. One of the symbols of the late-19th century civic improvement, the baths were subsequently demolished.

In 1991, for the first time since 1901, there was an increase in the population of Stalybridge to 22,295. The 1990s saw the proliferation of Mock Tudor style estates at Moorgate and along Huddersfield Road, close to Staley Hall; this continued into the 21st century with the completion of the Crowswood estate in Millbrook.

21st century

The Huddersfield Narrow Canal, which had been culverted in the early 1970s, was reinstated to the town centre between 1999 and May 2001 as part of a two-year multimillion-pound refurbishment. The canal now runs under the legs of an electricity pylon. The market hall closed on New Year's Eve 1999 and became the Civic Hall in 2001. Four years later, the area designated for retail space became exhibition space. There were plans to reopen the market and let the retail hall out to private contractors, though this came to naught. The town's cinema, the Palace, closed on 31 August 2003, with the last film being American Pie 3: The Wedding. The cinema has since been converted to become Rififi Nightclub and Amber Lounge Bar & Restaurant, which itself was closed down late in 2012 after two violent incidents on the same night.

In 2004, the Metropolitan Borough Council announced that they had granted permission for a developer to build 16 homes next to Staley Hall. A condition of the planning consent was that the hall be restored. As of 2008, the hall is still deteriorating. It is now listed as being in ""very bad"" condition on the English Heritage buildings at risk register. As of 2015 Staley Hall has been renovated and redeveloped into apartments.

Stalybridge suffered from Storm Angus on 21 November 2016 when  of rain fell on Tameside in five hours. Mottram Road and Huddersfield Road, Millbrook were flooded by water from a stream leading from the Walkerwood Reservoir.

In late June 2018, many properties in Stalybridge were threatened by a large wildfire advancing from Saddleworth Moor. 50 properties in the Carrbrook area of Stalybridge were evacuated on 26 June as the wildfire advanced towards them.

Governance

Civic history

The Municipal Borough of Stalybridge received its charter of incorporation on 5 March 1857, having been formed from part of Ashton-under-Lyne parish in Lancashire and parts of Dukinfield and Stayley parishes in Cheshire.  The Royal Charter declared that the council should consist of a Mayor, 6 Aldermen and 18 Councillors. The Borough was divided into three wards: Lancashire; Staley and Dukinfield. A list of Burgesses was published on 21 April 1857 and the first election of councillors was held on 1 May 1857. The contesting parties were the ""whites"" and the ""yellows"". The council met for the first time on 9 May and elected the first six Aldermen, from among those councillors the first Mayor, William Bayley, was elected.

The Arms of Stalybridge were granted by the College of Arms after the town received its charter of incorporation. The arms incorporated features from the coat of arms of the Stayley, Assheton, Dukinfield and Astley families who had all been land owners in the town. The motto, absque labore nihil, means ""nothing without labour"".

Under the terms of the Public Health Acts 1873 and 1875 Stalybridge corporation, like other municipal boroughs governed under the Municipal Corporations Act 1835, was designated as the authority governing the urban sanitary district.

The borough, both on the Lancashire and Cheshire sides of the river, was placed wholly within the administrative county of Cheshire in 1889, under the Local Government Act 1888, and Cheshire was adopted as the postal county for the entire town. The town is now part of the SK postcode area.

On 1 April 1936 Stalybridge was enlarged by gaining part of Matley civil parish, which had previously been part of Tintwistle rural district.

Stalybridge was twinned, in 1955, with Armentières, France.  In 1974 the area and assets of the Municipal Borough were combined with those of others districts, to form the Metropolitan Borough of Tameside. Stalybridge is currently represented by the occupants of nine of the 57 seats on the local Metropolitan Borough Council. These seats are spread over three wards: Stalybridge North, Stalybridge South and Dukinfield Stalybridge. Stalybridge currently has four Labour councillors and five Conservative councillors. Since 1998 the nine Stalybridge councillors have held meetings on a bimonthly basis, as the Stalybridge District Assembly.

Parliamentary representation

As a county palatine Cheshire was unrepresented in Parliament until the Chester and Cheshire (Constituencies) Act 1542. From 1545 Cheshire was represented by two Knights of the Shire. On the passage of the Great Reform Act of 1832, the area of Stalybridge south of the Tame was included in the North Cheshire constituency.

Between the passing of the Second Reform Act in 1867, and the general election of 1918, the town was represented in its own right through the Stalybridge Borough constituency. Since the 1918 general election the town has been represented in Parliament by the member for the Stalybridge and Hyde county constituency. The current Member of Parliament is Jonathan Reynolds, a former Tameside Councillor.

Geography

At  (53.483, −2.040) Stalybridge lies in the foothills of the Pennines, straddling the River Tame. The river forms part of the ancient boundary between Lancashire and Cheshire. On the boundary of the Peak District national park. The highest point in the town is the summit of Wild Bank at . Harridge Pike is the second highest peak at . Buckton Hill, the site of the mediaeval Buckton Castle, is another prominent landmark. The town centre itself is situated along the banks of the river between Ridge Hill to the north and Hough Hill  to the south. Stalybridge Weather Station is voluntarily manned and has been providing statistics since 1999. The local bedrock is millstone grit, covered by a thin layer of soil over clay, with surface rock outcrops.

Over the course of the 20th century the population of the town declined, after the demolition of the mid-19th century high-density housing. At the 2001 census Stalybridge had a population of 22,568. The town includes the localities of Heyheads, Buckton Vale, Carrbrook, Millbrook, Brushes Estate, Copley, Mottram Rise, Woodlands, Matley, Hough Hill, Castle Hall, Hollins Street, Hydes, Rassbottom, Waterloo, Cocker Hill, the Hague, Springs, Ridge Hill and Heyrod.

Demography

According to the Office for National Statistics, at the time of the United Kingdom Census 2001, Stalybridge had a population of 22,568. The 2001 population density was , with a 100 to 95.0 female-to-male ratio. Of those over 16 years old, 29.2% were single (never married) and 41.6% married. Stalybridge's 9,331 households included 29.1% one-person, 38.3% married couples living together, 9.7% were co-habiting couples, and 12.0% single parents with their children. Of those aged 16–74, 31.7% had no academic qualifications, below the average for Tameside (35.2%) but slightly higher than England (28.9%).

Population change

Environment

Much of the upland areas of the town are grouse moors. Boar Flat is part of the Dark Peak Site of Special Scientific Interest, as classified by Natural England. The slopes below the moors, particularly beneath Harridge Pike, are used for sheep grazing by the hill farms. The Stalybridge Country Park centres on two areas. Firstly, the Brushes Valley, with its four reservoirs running up into the Pennine Moors, and secondly Carrbrook, lying in the shadow of Buckton Castle. Linking the two areas, although outside the country park boundaries, is a good rights of way network, and areas of designated access land which take visitors into the Tame Valley, Longdendale and the Peak District. The country park affords views of the Cheshire Plain, Jodrell Bank and on very clear days the mountains of Snowdonia. Buckton Castle and Stalybridge cairn, a round cairn, west of Hollingworthhall Moor are both scheduled monuments.

The town's two parks are the main open spaces in the town centre. Cheetham Park was opened in June 1932 to a crowd of 15,000 people. The park was left to the town under the will of John Frederick Cheetham along with his house, Eastwood, and his collection of paintings, which now form part of the Astley Cheetham Art Gallery collection. The park is landscaped informally with large areas of woodland. Adjacent to Cheetham's Park lies the Eastwood Nature Reserve. Eastwood was one of the first reserves to be owned by the RSPB. It is managed by Cheshire Wildlife Trust. The reserve is a cut-over, lowland, raised mire SSSI, surrounded by a woodland fringe. Characteristic bog plants include sphagnum mosses, cotton grass and cross-leaved heath. Nine species of dragonfly and damselfly have been recorded on the reserve, along with the green hairstreak butterfly. The steep-sided broad-leaved woodland is bisected by Acres Brook and contains several old mill ponds. The geology is shale and sandstone, with a rich variety of plants and animals typical of woodland habitat on an acid soil. Access is from the A6018 Mottram Road. Car parking is available in Stalybridge Celtic FC's car park. The reserve occupies .

Stamford Park is registered by English Heritage as being of special interest. In 1865, local mill owner Abel Harrison died and his home, Highfield House, and its extensive grounds, on the border with Ashton were bought by the two towns. Neighbouring land was donated by George Harry Grey, 7th Earl of Stamford and 3rd Earl of Warrington. The whole area was landscaped to become Stamford Park and opened by the Earl on 12 July 1873. The former mill reservoir, known as Chadwick Dams, was incorporated into the park in 1891. The reservoir was divided in two by an embankment, with the southern section becoming the present boating lake. This area includes waterfalls cascading over rock faces and gargoyles built into the bridges and walls. The park has tennis courts, bowling greens, a children's playground, The park is the venue for the annual Tulip Sunday Festival.

Culture

Music
Stalybridge has an established musical tradition. Stalybridge Old Band was formed in 1809, perhaps the first civilian brass band in the world. The band currently contests in the second section. Carrbrook Brass currently contests in the fourth section and represent the town annually at the Armentières festival. An annual brass band contest has been held in the town on Whit Friday, since at least 1870. Other contests have been held on the same day in the surrounding villages of Millbrook, Carrbrook and Heyrod. There is now an established tradition of holding brass band contests on this day around Stalybridge, Mossley and Saddleworth. Bands travel by coach from all over the United Kingdom, and sometimes from other countries, to contest in as many different locations as possible on the day.

The song It's a Long Way to Tipperary was created in the Newmarket Tavern, by the composer Jack Judge, in 1912, after being challenged to write, compose, and produce a song in just one night;. It was first sung in public by him in the Grand Theatre on Corporation Street on 31 January 1912. On 31 January 1953 a memorial tablet was unveiled by Jack Hylton on the wall of the old Newmarket Tavern, where the song was composed. To coincide with the ceremony a wreath was laid on Jack Judge's grave, by the mayor of Oldbury. Jack Judge is now also commemorated by a statue in Lord Pendry Square outside the Old Victoria Market Hall.

More recently a live folk music tradition has developed in the town. The Buffet Bar Folk Club meets every Saturday at 9 pm and the Free and Easy folk club meet at 9 pm on alternate Thursdays at the White House public house in the town centre. Some members of the Fivepenny Piece who sang traditional North Country music in the 1970s were from Stalybridge. and the band performed songs such as ""Stalybridge Station"" and ""Stalybridge Market"". They also took ""In Bowton's Yard"", the work of local poet Samuel Laycock, and put it to music.

Art
Built as a gift to the town of Stalybridge by John Frederick Cheetham and his wife Beatrice Astley, the Astley Cheetham Art Gallery originally opened to the public as a lecture theatre on 14 January 1901. The space was turned into a gallery to house the Astley Cheetham Collection, bequeathed in 1932. This collection has grown with gifts and donations throughout the 20th century and is one of the most interesting small regional collections of 15th century Italian paintings. The collection of work by Italian old masters includes 'Portrait of a Young Man' by Alessandro Allori. Also, British art of the 19th and 20th centuries is represented by artists such as John Linnell, Richard Parkes Bonington, George Price Boyce, Burne-Jones, Mark Gertler and Duncan Grant. Aske Hall by J. M. W. Turner is also part of the gallery's collection. Alongside exhibitions of the collection, the gallery also hosts a programme of temporary exhibitions by regional artists.

During the earlier part of the 20th century, Stalybridge was artistically captured by the painter L. S. Lowry. Some of his paintings were of the people of Stalybridge. Lowry continued painting pictures until his death in 1976. His house is marked with a blue plaque on Stalybridge Road, Mottram in Longdendale. There is also a statue of him, holding his sketch pad, on a bench near the Stalybridge Road bus stop. Sheila Vaughan is a Stalybridge artist working in oils and acrylic. Her work and that of other Stalybridge artists such as Keith Taylor are displayed at the Peoples Gallery on Melbourne Street.

Literature
As well as being described by Engels, Stalybridge was featured in Disraeli's Coningsby. The children's author Beatrix Potter visited Gorse Hall many times as a child as it was the home of her maternal grandmother. Samuel Laycock (1826–93) was a librarian at the Mechanics' Institute for two years. His poetry presents a vivid impression of the mid-19th century, working-class life, and he drew on his personal experience in the cotton industry. His best-loved poems are ""Bowton's Yard"" and ""Bonny Brid"" – both written in Stalybridge. Tim Willocks, author of Bad City Blues, Green River Rising and Bloodstained Kings is from Stalybridge. Dolores Gordon-Smith, author of the Jack Haldean murder mystery series (published by Constable & Robinson and currently by Severn House) and Frankies' Letter (on Kindle) is from Stalybridge and currently resides there. M. John Harrison describes Stalybridge in his short story ""The Ice Monkey"" as a place ""where nothing is clear-cut and there is neither town nor country, just a grim industrial muddle of the two"".

Traditions

Whit Friday
Whit Friday is the name given to the first Friday after Whitsun in areas of northeast Cheshire, southeast Lancashire and the western fringes of Yorkshire. The day has a cultural significance in Stalybridge as the date on which the annual Whit Walks were traditionally held. It is also the day on which the traditional annual Whit Friday brass band contests are held.

Wakes Week
The wakes were originally religious festivals that commemorated church dedications. Particularly important was the Rushcart festival associated with Rogationtide. During the Industrial Revolution the tradition of the wakes was adapted into a regular summer break in the mill towns of Lancashire, where each locality would nominate a wakes week during which the cotton mills would all close at the same time. Stalybridge Wakes occurs in the third week of July. Wakes Week became the focus for fairs, and eventually for holidays where the mill workers would go to the seaside, eventually on the newly developing railways.

Food and drink
Stalybridge has the public house with the longest name in Britain – The Old Thirteenth Cheshire Astley Volunteer Rifleman Corps Inn, which closed in June 2016 but reopened in April 2019 – and also the one with the shortest, Q. The railway station is one of the last in Britain to retain its original buffet, the 1998 refurbishment of which won awards from CAMRA and English Heritage.

The restoration of the canal between 1999 and 2001 attracted new commercial ventures such as riverside cafés and boat trips. The reopening of the canal and the fact that the Tame runs through the town centre resulted in the nickname ""Little Venice"". Stalybridge has in recent years acquired another nickname, ""Staly Vegas""; the nickname became popular and was used ironically after the controversial conversion of premises in the shopping area into nightclubs and bars, the proliferation of takeaways and the refurbishment of some of the more traditional pubs.

The town's traditional foods include Tater Hash (Potato Pie, or Meat and Potato Pie), a variation on Lancashire Hotpot, black peas, today mainly eaten on Whit Friday, and tripe. Stalybridge is the location of the region's last remaining tripe shop.

Media
The Stalybridge Reporter weekly newspaper was established in 1855. With The North Cheshire Herald it now serves the wider district under the name The Tamesider Reporter. Its office, and that of The Glossop Chronicle is at Park House, Acres Lane. The weekly free newspaper The Tameside Advertiser was established in 1979 and is now owned by Trinity Mirror and distributed throughout Stalybridge. The town has been used for location shoots for various film and television series. The most notable of these was the John Schlesinger film Yanks which featured Richard Gere and was released in 1979. The opening sequence of the film features Stalybridge War Memorial on Trinity Street and the US army camp scenes were filmed at Stamford Golf Club in spring 1978.

In 1986 the BBC children's TV series Jossy's Giants was filmed in the town. In 2009 the BBC3 Comedy Show We Are Klang was filmed at the Victoria Market Hall, and around the town centre. Scenes from Coronation Street, Making Out, Common As Muck and The League of Gentlemen have also been shot there.

Religion
Until the 18th century the Manor of Staley formed part of the parish of St Michael and All Angels, Mottram. The first church to be built in Stalybridge was Old St George's Church, Cocker Hill which was consecrated by the Bishop of Chester on 25 July 1776. The church collapsed on 15 May 1778. After the Industrial Revolution, the rising population and the settlement of people from various parts of the country meant that Stalybridge became a centre for a wide range of denominations and sects. The history of these churches in the town is complex, with some churches having occupied many different sites. The influence of the churches in the town remained strong well into the 20th century and formed part of the basis of Stalybridge's sense of identity.

The first Methodist chapel was erected in 1802 on the corner of Chapel Street and Rassbottom Street. The Baptist chapel on King Street, was opened by the Particular (Ebenezer) Baptists. This chapel was subsequently occupied by the Congregational Church on 3 October 1830. The Particular (Ebenezer) Baptists moved to a new chapel on Cross Leech Street on 28 October 1828.

Churches

There are two Roman Catholic parishes – St Peter's, Stalybridge, the foundation stone of which was laid on 8 June 1838 and St Raphael's, Millbrook. Both parishes are in the Diocese of Shrewsbury.
Methodist
The octagonal Stalybridge Methodist Church on High Street opened in 1966.

Congregationalist
Stalybridge Congregational Church is to be found in a modern building on Baker Street, just off Acres Lane, behind the Organ public house. Its original building, which opened for worship in 1861 and was demolished around the turn of the 21st century, was situated between Melbourne Street and Trinity Street in the town centre.
Unitarian
The Unitarian Church on Forester Drive was established in 1870 and is part of the East Cheshire Union of Unitarian and Free Christian Churches.
Evangelical/Non-denominational
Stalybridge Revival Church, on Mount Street, formerly known as Stalybridge Evangelical Church, was established in 2009. The church has since moved to Millbrook but retains use of the building on Mount Street.

Education
Before 1910, primary education was provided by the church schools. In 1910 the borough opened its own school on Waterloo Road. In 1927, West Hill School, a central school for boys was opened. The central school for girls opened in 1930. Until 1980 secondary modern education was provided by schools in the town itself; and grammar school education by Hyde Grammar School. For Roman Catholic pupils, grammar school education was provided by Harrytown, Bredbury and Xaverian, Rusholme. Catholic secondary modern education was available from 1963 at St Peter and St Paul, Dukinfield.

In 1977 the Local Education Authority appealed to keep its grammar schools rather than be forced by the government to adopt a comprehensive system. The Lord of Appeal Lord Lane was personally critical of Fred Mulley, the Secretary of State for Education and Science for being ""far from frank"" about his reason for intervening in Tameside and joined in the judgement which found for Tameside and brought a halt to comprehensivisation. However, following the election of a Labour council in 1980 the local grammar schools were abolished and all the secondary modern and grammar schools in Stalybridge, Hyde and Dukinfield became comprehensives.

Gray (née Gantz; October 11, 1926 – March 28, 2014) was an American Democratic politician from Framingham, Massachusetts. She represented the 39th Middlesex district from 1973 to 1974, the 56th Middlesex district from 1975 to 1978, and the 6th Middlesex district from 1979 to 1996 in the Massachusetts House of Representatives. She was first elected as a Republican, but switched parties in October 1990.

Early life 
Gray was born in New York City on October 11, 1926. Her father, Gerald Gantz, was a Republican stockbroker and her mother, Marcella Gantz (née Beck) was described as a ""closet Democrat"". She was rebellious in high school until her parents enrolled her in a more rigorous private school.

After graduation, she attended Connecticut College where she met Richard Gray. She received her B.A. in 1948 and, after turning down Richard's first marriage proposal, travelled around Europe with a friend, where she attended the Institute of International Education at the University of Oxford. After she returned to Massachusetts, she agreed to marry Richard and they moved to Framingham. She later graduated from Western New England College with a Masters of Public Administration.

Gray worked in public relations for the American Association for the United Nations, as a columnist and editor for a newspaper in Hartford, Connecticut, and in advertising for Esquire.

Political career 
Gray was first elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives in 1972, serving in the 168th Massachusetts General Court as a Republican representative of the 39th Middlesex district. She was one of only eight women out of a total of 240 legislators. In 1974, she was re-elected to the House, serving as representative for the 56th Middlesex district until 1978. She would serve on the Ways and means committee from 1974 to 1992. In 1979, Gray was elected as a representative in the House for the 6th Middlesex district, a position she would hold until 1996. She served on the Rules committee in 1992, as Chair of the Counties committee in 1993, as Chair of the Local Affairs committee in 1994, and as Chair of the Natural Resources and Agriculture committee from 1995 to 1996.

In 1990, she lost the Republican primary and so she switched to the Democratic Party and won the general election to hold her seat. She advocated for women's and children's rights, environmental protection, health and safety, and land use. She focused on legislation relating to mandatory seat-belt laws, river protection, and zoning. She supported gay rights and proposed legislation after Harvey Milk's 1978 assassination. In 2002, she published a memoir on her time in the legislature, titled A Woman's Ways & Means.

Gray was heavily involved in local politics outside her position in the Massachusetts House of Representatives. In the 1970s, she worked with other activists to create the Wayside Youth and Family Support Network, a regional social services agency, and in 1985, she helped found WIN Haven, the first shelter for abused women in the region. She also served on the Framingham Planning Board (which she was the first woman elected to), the Charter Commission, and the Metropolitan Area Planning Council. She helped found the Massachusetts Caucus of Women Legislators as well as the Framingham chapter of the League of Women Voters.

Personal life 
Gray and her husband divorced after thirty years of marriage and she met Norman E. Gardner, a graphic designer, while campaigning in Framingham. They married in August 1985 and were together until his death in 2004. Gray had four children: Suzanne, Linda, Nancy, and John. After retiring in 1996, she moved to Wellfleet, Massachusetts.

Gray died on March 28, 2014, in Cape Cod Hospital, Hyannis, Massachusetts from complications following a stroke.

981,"['Domestic sales of straight whiskeyed surpass 27 million 9 - liter cases in 2021 .', 'The remaining portion is highered - proof spirit , often unage neutral grain spirits , which are less expensive to produce .']","Straight whiskey (or straight whisky), as defined in United States law, is whiskey that is distilled from a fermented (malted or unmalted) cereal grain mash to a concentration not exceeding 80% alcohol by volume (abv) and aged in new charred oak barrels for at least two years at a concentration not exceeding 62.5% at the start of the aging process. Domestic sales of straight whiskey surpassed 27 million 9-liter cases in 2021.

The only allowed modifications to straight whiskey prior to its bottling consist of batching whiskey from different barrels (and sometimes from different distilleries, although only from within the same state), chill filtering the whiskey, and adding water to reduce proof while retaining at least a 40% abv concentration. This definition is established for production of American whiskey for consumption within the United States as per the U.S federal Standards of Identity for Distilled Spirits. The regulations do not necessarily apply to American whiskey made for export.

Alternatively, straight can also refer to a way of requesting and/or serving a drink of whiskey—pouring the spirit without any water, cordial, or other mixer. Thus, in bartending terminology, straight is typically synonymous with neat.

Aging and labeling requirements
The core aging requirement that defines a whiskey as straight is if the distillate has spent at least two years stored in charred new oak barrels, except corn whiskey which must use uncharred or used oak barrels. The spirit oxidizes during this aging period, and penetrates the wood, extracting many of the flavor compounds and caramelized wood sugars.

A straight whiskey that has been aged less than four years is required to be labeled with an age statement describing the actual age of the product.

Other than an age statement, which lists the age of the youngest spirit in a bottle, the only other special labeling dealing with the age of a straight whiskey in the U.S. is bottled in bond. All bonded whiskeys are required to be straight whiskeys, and are additionally required to be aged for at least four years. Bonded whiskeys must also fulfill several other requirements.

Ingredients
When at least 51% of the content of the mash used in the production of a straight whiskey consists of corn, rye, barley, or wheat, the designation can be coupled with a special name associated with the type of grain and whether the grain was malted. For example, a straight whiskey may be a bourbon whiskey (using a mash of corn), malt whiskey (using a mash of malted barley), rye whiskey, rye malt whiskey, or wheat whiskey. An especially prominent variation is the labeling ""Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey"", used to indicate a straight whiskey made in Kentucky from a mash of at least 51% corn grain. For a straight whiskey to be called corn whiskey, it must use a mash with at least 80% corn and be aged in used or uncharred barrels. 

Extra ingredients, such as caramel coloring, are forbidden in straight whiskey. In contrast, even the regulations governing single malt whiskey production in some countries allow the addition of caramel coloring to enhance appearance.

Distillation limit
The limit of 80% maximum abv concentration for the distillation is a key element of the definition of straight whiskey. At alcohol concentrations exceeding this amount, most of the flavor from the original fermented mash that was used in the distillation process will be removed, resulting in a more neutral grain spirit.

In other countries, whiskey may be produced from a spirit that is much higher in alcoholic proof, which generally reduces the flavor derived from the original mash that was used in its production.

Relationship to blended whiskey
Straight whiskey is a distinctly different product from blended whiskey. Most premium-category brands of American whiskey are straight whiskey, while the economy category is primarily blended whiskey.

However, straight whiskey is also an important component of American blended whiskey. Blended whiskey made in the United States must contain at least 20% straight whiskey. The remaining portion is higher-proof spirit, often unaged neutral grain spirits, which are less expensive to produce. The straight whiskey component adds characteristic whiskey flavor to the blend, as the higher proof spirit loses most flavoring compounds during the distillation process, and does not gain flavors from barrel aging. Blended whiskey may also contain additives for coloring and flavoring.

Canadian whiskey, which is typically a blend, also uses straight-whiskey-style spirits as a major flavor component, though Canada does require at least three years of aging (usually in used barrels) to qualify any product as Canadian whiskey.

He played 26 games in the National Hockey League (NHL) with the Detroit Red Wings between 1939 and 1942. The rest of his career, which lasted from 1938 to 1951, was spent in various minor leagues. He later became a coach, spending several years in the junior Ontario Hockey Association, finishing by coaching the Kansas City Scouts of the NHL for 32 games during their second and final season in 1975–76.

Career
Bush began his career by playing junior hockey in Guelph, Ontario. He then became a hockey vagabond, playing on fourteen separate squads over thirteen years as a professional. He played 26 games over parts of two seasons in the National Hockey League for the Detroit Red Wings, but spent most of his career in the American Hockey League Bush also saw his career interrupted by military service, as he took off the entire 1945-46 campaign to serve in the Royal Canadian Air Force. Bush's five-point Game 3 in the 1942 Stanley Cup Finals remains the record for defensemen in a championship round game.

In 1950, Bush began his long coaching career by presiding over his hometown junior club, the Collingwood Shipbuilders. He later led a variety of other teams, including the Guelph Biltmores , Kitchener Rangers and Hamilton Red Wings (  he coached  Hamilton to a 1962 Memorial Cup victory) of junior hockey, and the Quebec Aces and Richmond Robins of the AHL. He took a job as a scout with the fledgling Kansas City Scouts, and he served as interim coach for 32 games in 1976.

He was son of Muztar Khairabadi and great grandson of Fazl-e-Haq Khairabadi his career spanned four decades during which he worked with music composers including C. Ramchandra, O.P. Nayyar, Datta Naik also credited as N. Datta and Khayyam and wrote 151 songs. Notable among them were songs from his breakthrough film, AR Kardar's Yasmin (1955), Aankhon hi Aankhon Mein in Guru Dutt's CID (1956), Yeh dil aur unki nigahon ke saaye in Prem Parbat (1974) and Aaja re in Noorie (1979) and his last song, Ae Dil-e-naadaan, in Kamal Amrohi's Razia Sultan (1983).

His poetry works include Nazr-e-Butaan, Salaasil, Javidaan, Pichali Pehar, Ghar Angan and Khaak-e-dil. The latter (""The Ashes of Heart"") was a poetry collection for which he was awarded the 1976 Sahitya Akademi Award in Urdu by Sahitya Akademi, India's National Academy of Letters.

Early life

Jan Nisar passed his matriculation from Victoria Collegiate High School, Gwalior, and in 1930 joined Aligarh Muslim University, from where he gained his B.A. Honours and M.A. degrees. He started his doctoral work, but had to return to Gwalior due to family conditions.

Career

In 1949, he resigned from his job, moved to Bombay to write lyrics for Urdu/Hindi movies besides ghazals and nazms for general publication. Once in Bombay, he came in touch with other progressive writers, like Mulk Raj Anand, Krishan Chander, Rajinder Singh Bedi and Ismat Chugtai, who often met at Bombay's Silver Fish Restaurant, and subsequently came to be known as 'Bombay Group of Writers'. Success came his way quite late as a film lyricist, till then he was supported by his wife who had stayed back in Bhopal, though she died prematurely of cancer in 1953.  Finally he had a career breakthrough, with Yasmeen (1955), with music by C. Ramchandra. His association with Madan Mohan, the music director resulted in many memorable movie songs. Some of his notable lyrics were,  Meri Neendon Mein Tum in Naya Andaz (1956) by Kishore Kumar, Shamshad Begum, Garib Jan Key Hamko Naa Tum Daga Dena sung by Mohd. Rafi in Chhoo Mantar, the hit Piya piya piya... in Baap Re Baap (1955) music by O.P. Nayyar,  Aap Yun Faaslon Se by Lata Mangeshkar in Shankar Hussain (1977).

His poetry was secular and like many of progressive writers of his generation talked of freedom, dignity, economic exploitation and other issues gleaming of the leftist leanings. Even his romanticism which was amply displayed in his ghazals, was replete with references to household and family life. His notable books include Nazr-e-Butaan, Salaasil, Javidaan, Ghar Angan and Khaak-e-Dil (all Urdu titles). One of his many famous couplets is :

Ashaar mere yuu.N to zamaane ke liye hai.n,
kuchh sher faqat unako sunaane ke liye hai.n

Although my poems are meant for the whole world,
There are some couplets meant just for the beloved

He wrote and produced a film, Bahu Begum (1967), starring Pradeep Kumar and Meena Kumari. During the period of four-year to his death he published three collections of his works most important of them being, Khak-e-Dil (The Ashes of Heart""), which has his representative poems from 1935 to 1970, and which won him the Sahitya Akademi Award (Urdu) in 1976. Jan Nisar was commissioned by the first Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru to collate the best Hindustani poetry of last 300 years, and later the first edition of the book titled Hindustan Hamara (Our Hindustan) in two volumes was released by Indira Gandhi. It contained Urdu verses on a topics, ranging from love and praise for India and its history, to festivals like Holi and Diwali, on Indian rivers like the Ganges, Yamuna and the Himalayas.

He died in Bombay on 19 August 1976, while he was still working on Kamal Amrohi's film, Razia Sultan  (1983). He was nominated posthumously for 1980 Filmfare Best Lyricist Award for ""Aaja Re Mere Dilbar"" from the film, Noorie.

His anthology, Hindustan Hamara was re-released in Hindi in 2006

Family
In 1943, he married Safia, sister of the poet Majaz. Safia worked as a school teacher at an Urdu-medium madarsa (Muslim school). She was meeting a practical necessity, to work outside her home, because Jan Nisar's income was at best sporadic, and it was necessary for her to work to support her children. Thus, when Jan Nisar moved to Mumbai to try his luck at earning a living as a film lyricist, Safia stayed back in Gwalior with their children, and wrote her absent husband a series of letters in Urdu. A collection of these letters, written between 1 October 1943 to 29 December 1953 penned, were first published in 1955 in two volumes under the title, ""Harf-e-Aashna"" and ""Zer-e-Lab."" Professor Asghar Wajahat, former Head of the Hindi Department, Jamia Millia Islamia, translated these letters into Hindi and this was published under the title ""Tumhare Naam"" in 2004.

Safia Akhtar died of cancer on 17 January 1953, less than ten years after her wedding, and left behind two very small sons. Jan Nisar left the children in the care of relatives while he pursued his hobbies of writing poetry and hobnobbing with various luminaries and socialites in Mumbai. Three years after Safia's death, Jan Nisar got married again on 17 September 1956, to Khadija Talat. His children by Safia did not have a good relationship with their step-mother, and his relations with them was likewise dysfunctional.

He has previously played in MLB for the Philadelphia Phillies, Texas Rangers, Arizona Diamondbacks, Kansas City Royals, Oakland Athletics, and Boston Red Sox.

With the Phillies, Diekman began as a starting pitcher and progressed through a few levels of the Phillies' farm system in his first two years in that role, before adjusting his mechanics and lowering his arm slot to throw sidearm out of the bullpen, as a relief pitcher. The adjustment worked and helped him move through the remaining levels of the Phillies' farm system. In 2012, Diekman made his major league debut. Over the next two seasons, he split time between the major league Phillies and their Triple-A (AAA) affiliate, the Lehigh Valley IronPigs, though while he was with the major league team, he was considered one of the ""lone bright spots"" in both 2012 and 2013. Diekman throws a fastball in the upper-90s (mph), a slider, and an occasional changeup; his fastball is among the fastest of any left-handed reliever in the major leagues.

Early career
Diekman was born to Paul and Billie Diekman, in 1987. He has one brother, Brian. The Diekmans lived in Wymore, Nebraska, where Jake attended Southern High School. His alma mater was too small to field a baseball team, so he instead focused on golf. Eventually, Diekman joined an American Legion baseball team, playing in the summer with other players from Wymore and several surrounding towns, which he called ""the best experience of my life ... so much fun."" Concurrently, Diekman worked full-time at a lawn mower factory, to earn money to pursue a post-secondary education.

After graduating from high school, Diekman enrolled at Doane College, pitching one season for the school's ball team. He then transferred to Cloud County Community College, in Kansas. Following Diekman's sophomore season, he attended a junior college baseball showcase at which, with a fastball well over , Diekman drew much interest. He received an offer for a full scholarship to be a Nebraska Cornhusker, which he would have accepted, had the Phillies not drafted him in the 2007 Major League Baseball Draft's 30th round.

Professional career

Philadelphia Phillies

Between 2007 and 2010, he pitched in the lower levels of the Philadelphia Phillies' Minor League system initially as a starter, and subsequently as a reliever. Although he initially saw success in 2007, posting a 2.72 ERA in 10 starts with GCL Phillies and Williamsport Crosscutters, he struggled in 2008, posting an ERA of 5.09 in 27 starts, split between Williamsport and the Lakewood BlueClaws. At the conclusion of both 2008 and 2009, he pitched in the Florida Instructional League to continue honing his skills on the mound.

He converted from a starting pitcher to a reliever in 2009, along with several other Phillies pitching prospects. Around that time, he also, at the suggestion of the same minor league pitching coaches who converted him to relief, lowered his release point to his current low angle. Success did not manifest itself immediately, as he still posted a 4.04 ERA in 2009, his first season in relief, but in 2010, he cut his ERA to 2.91 while splitting time between Lakewood and the Clearwater Threshers, the Phillies High-A affiliate. At the end of the 2010 season, he played for the Mesa Solar Sox in the Arizona Fall League. He spent the 2011 season with the Double-A Reading Phillies, accruing a 0–1 record and a 3.05 ERA and 3 saves in 53 games. Thereafter, the Phillies added him to their 40-man roster to protect him from the Rule 5 draft.

After receiving praise from Phillies' pitching coach Rich Dubee for his performance in spring training, Diekman opened the 2012 season with the Triple-A (AAA) Lehigh Valley IronPigs. With Lehigh Valley, he posted a 1–0 record and a 0.59 ERA with 5 saves in 13 games in the season's first month.  He was added to the Phillies' 25-man Major League roster on May 11, and four days later recorded a win against the Houston Astros in his MLB debut. He finished the year an established lefty specialist, and had a 3.95 ERA, though walked 6.6 batters per 9 innings, and was erratic in his control.

Entering 2013, Diekman was expected to be a key part of the Phillies bullpen after his success in 2012, however he did not break camp with the big league club, beginning the season in AAA. In AAA, he struggled, which delayed his arrival to the major league team until June. While with the big league club, he continued his dominance of left-handed hitters, however was not as good against right-handed hitters (a 150-point differential in opponent batting average and over 300 point differential in On-base plus slugging (OPS)). Diekman improved his control, which made him a presumptive member of the 2014 bullpen, as he was one of 2013's ""lone bright spots"" for the otherwise dismal Phillies' bullpen. Ultimately, he did make the Phillies' opening day roster as a member of the bullpen.

Early in the season, Diekman emerged as a reliable reliever in the Phillies' bullpen, and was used extensively by manager Ryne Sandberg. As the season progressed, Diekman was more successful against left-handed hitters than right-handed hitters, but was used against both in a variety of situations. On September 1, 2014, Diekman was one of four pitchers who combined for a no-hitter in the Phillies' 7-0 win over the Atlanta Braves in Turner Field. By the end of the season, the Phillies had one of the best bullpens in the league, and it consisted predominantly of young players such as Diekman. There was excitement from both Phillies' personnel and writers that the bullpen could remain solid for a long time because of young pitchers such as Diekman, Ken Giles, and Justin De Fratus. Moreover, Diekman and Giles had potential as closers should the Phillies trade Jonathan Papelbon. Overall, Diekman emerged as a name to be mentioned among the ""elite"" relievers of the National League, but was overused against right-handed batters, which hurt his statistics.

Texas Rangers
On July 31, 2015, Diekman was traded to the Texas Rangers along with Cole Hamels in exchange for Matt Harrison, Nick Williams, Jorge Alfaro, Jake Thompson, Alec Asher, and Jerad Eickhoff. He became an important bullpen piece in the Rangers' run to the playoffs in 2016. Diekman and the Rangers agreed to a one-year deal worth $1.225 million on January 29, 2016, and avoided arbitration. Diekman finished the 2016 season with a 4-2 record, 4 saves and a 3.40 ERA in 66 appearances.  On January 25, 2017, Diekman underwent surgery for chronic ulcerative colitis. He only made 11 appearances towards the end of the season. In 2018, fully healthy, Diekman posted an ERA of 3.69 in 47 games. He struck out 48 batters in 39 innings.

Arizona Diamondbacks
On July 31, 2018, Diekman was traded to the Arizona Diamondbacks for Wei-Chieh Huang and Joshua Javier. The trade took place while the Diamondbacks and Rangers were facing off in a two-game series in Arizona. Diekman struggled after being acquired by Arizona, posting an ERA of 7.53 in 24 appearances. Diekman became a free agent following the 2018 season.

Kansas City Royals
On February 13, 2019, Diekman signed a one-year contract with a mutual option for 2020 with the Kansas City Royals. The deal was worth a reported $2.75 million guaranteed, plus performance incentives. In 48 relief appearances with the 2019 Royals, Diekman accrued a 4.75 ERA and an 0–6 record while striking out 63 batters in  innings.

Oakland Athletics
On July 27, 2019, the Royals traded Diekman to the Oakland Athletics for Ismael Aquino and Dairon Blanco. On September 6, Diekman pitched in a suspended game between the Athletics and Detroit Tigers that originally started on May 19, allowing a double in a scoreless inning. This appearance was recorded on the original game date of May 19, when Diekman threw an inning of relief for the Royals against the Los Angeles Angels. Diekman thus accomplished the rare feat of having pitched for two different teams on the same day, statistically. For the 2019 season, he tied for the major league lead in holds (31). In 28 games for the A's, Diekman struck out 21 in  innings.

Diekman became a free agent following the 2019 season after the Athletics declined his contract option. On December 3, 2019, Diekman re-signed with Oakland on a two-year contract. In the 2020 shortened season, Diekman only allowed 2 runs in  innings.

Boston Red Sox
On March 16, 2022, Diekman signed a two-year contract with a club option for 2024 with the Boston Red Sox. In 44 appearances through the end of July, he compiled a 5–1 record and a 4.23 ERA.

Chicago White Sox
On August 1, 2022, Diekman was traded to the Chicago White Sox for catcher Reese McGuire and a player to be named later or cash considerations.

Pitching style

A lefty specialist, Diekman throws a fastball in the mid-90s, a slider at 78–81, and an occasional changeup to right-handed hitters. His fastball is among the fastest of left-handed relievers in the major leagues. Like most left-handed pitchers, particularly those who throw out of an arm angle similar to Diekman's, he is tough on left-handed hitters. In 2013, he held lefties to just a .368 OPS, though allowed a .765 OPS to right-handed hitters. Despite suggestions he remain a lefty specialist, he emerged in 2014 as a favorite middle reliever for manager Ryne Sandberg against both righties and lefties. In 2020, Diekman credited Rob Friedman with helping improve his slider grip through Twitter, increasing the horizontal break on his slider substantially.

Personal life
Diekman's mother died at age 57 just months before the Phillies drafted him. Diekman describes his father as his ""best friend"", and one who has helped him cope with his mother's death. His mother, Billie, was Diekman's ""biggest fan"" and had to order her husband, Paul, to stop pacing and watch Diekman pitch. Diekman has sought therapy to cope with the loss of his mother, and meditates and thinks about her during ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" prior to each game.  Away from baseball, Diekman holds an associate's degree in business administration from Cloud County Community College. He enjoys listening to music, working out, playing golf, and long walks on the beach. He resides in Beatrice, Nebraska, during the offseason. Because of his struggles with ulcerative colitis, he started a non-profit association called Gut It Out to benefit others who struggle with the disease.

Jake is married to the former Amanda Soltero, the 2014 Miss Nebraska USA and former TV reporter for 10/11 News in Lincoln, Nebraska.  They have one daughter.  Jake's father-in-law Saul Soltero was a pitcher in the San Diego Padres organization, posting a 2.58 ERA and .643 winning percentage in 159 games over a 6-year span.  He reached as high as the Double-A level before an elbow injury resulting in Tommy John surgery sidetracked his career.

Endangered species living in Armenia are the Caucasian bear, Caucasian bearded goat, the Armenian mouflon (sheep) and the leopard.

Fauna

Fauna in Armenia is diverse given the country's relatively small geographic size, owing to the varied habitats created by the area's mountainous terrain. Armenia is an important area for migratory animals, about 350 different bird species were recorded in the country. Many of the world's domesticated animals originated in or near Armenia, and the mouflon, the ancestor of domesticated sheep, is present there. Research suggests that about a quarter of the animal species in Armenia are internationally endangered. The mouflon is suffering a great population decline due to poaching and habitat loss, and the Sevan trout, which once made up thirty percent of the fish in Lake Sevan, have virtually disappeared.

Southern and south-western Armenia remains the last stronghold of the Persian leopard in the Caucasus, in part due to the region being connected with the leopard population in Iran. The total population in Armenia is thought to number 10-20 individuals, including adults, sub-adults and cubs.

Historically in Cheshire, it stands on the River Etherow which forms the border with Derbyshire.

Description

Home Farm dates from 1604, and Broadbottom Hall from 1680.

There was a 14th-century water-powered corn mill, and Moss Mill, an 18th-century woollen mill which changed to cotton in the 19th century.

Broadbottom has one remaining textile mill that is still currently operating. The factory mill is next to the River Etherow and is called Lymefield Mill. It is currently occupied by Tiviot Prints Ltd.

Landmarks
At Summerbottom there is a row of 18th-century weavers' cottages; they had a communal top floor where the looms were stored.

Hodge Printworks started out as a woollen mill in 1798. In 1805 it was converted into a dyeworks. The dyed cloth was of such high quality that some pieces are still on display in the Victoria and Albert Museum. In 1986, a team of archaeologists excavated the dye vats.

Best Hill Mill was started in 1784 by John Marsland, but closed in 1884. The mill reopened early in the 20th century to make tape and webbing for use in World War I. It closed again in 1930.

Broad Mills was a collection of mills (factories), including a calico printing mill, run by the Sidebottom family. In the 1840s it ran 25,000 spindles and 1,500 looms. In 1860, there were 1,200 people working there. The mill was bought by the John Hirst & Sons in 1872. In 1889 it became part of Broadbottom Mills Ltd who also owned Lymefield Mill. In 1906 it passed to the Broad Mills Co. Ltd., who worked it until 1934 when they went into liquidation. A fire in the 1940s led to the mills' demolition in 1949. Lymefield Visitor Centre is close to the mills.

In 1842, the railway reached Broadbottom and a station was built on the Manchester–Glossop Line. A  and  over the River Etherow was constructed.

Community
Broadbottom Community Association organizes events throughout the year for the local residents. Their programme can be found on their website. The BCA has published a book about the history of Broadbottom compiled by local resident Mollie Sayer.

Broadbottom Cricket Club plays in the Derbyshire and Cheshire League.

Jim Poyser lives in Broadbottom.

The Ring magazine voted it the number-one boxing venue in the world, and Sports Illustrated noted it as the last great boxing venue in the country.

The Blue Horizon was originally constructed as three four-story Second Empire style houses in 1865. Originally built to house the nouveau riche, the properties were eventually sold to the Loyal Order of Moose. Architect Carl Berger oversaw the 1914 alterations to house the fraternal lodge, adding a ballroom, bar, and auditorium. Lodge #54, located at 1312-1316 North Broad Street had over 20,000 members by 1920, at that point the highest membership of any fraternal lodge in the world. By the late 1920s, membership had reached over 40,000 and plans were made for an extensive expansion of the building; however, the Great Depression forced Lodge #54 to abandon their plans. The building also got its first taste of professional boxing during the Moose era, with two fight cards on March 1 and March 28 of 1938. The March 28th card featured heavyweight Willie Reddish, who later trained Sonny Liston and Joe Frazier.

Jimmy Toppi Sr. purchased the building in 1961 for $85,000, and renamed it after the song ""Beyond the Blue Horizon"" from the 1930 film Monte Carlo. After another series of renovations, regular boxing shows began in the Blue Horizon on November 3, 1961. The main event featured Hall of Famer George Benton against Chico Corsey, a late substitute. The early days of the building as a boxing venue saw regular weekly shows. Promoter Marty Kramer was given a grant from Madison Square Garden to put on these matches in order to develop young fighters. Kramer promoted over 30 main events before leaving the Blue Horizon in 1963. Promoter Herman Taylor then hosted three nationally televised bouts at the venue in 1963 and 1964, featuring Jose Stable, Dick Turner, Harold Johnson, Henry Hank, Stanley Hayward, and Curtis Cokes. On May 26, 1966 ""Gypsy"" Joe Harris took a 10-round decision over Johnny Knight in a fight promoted by Lou Lucchese. There would be no more fights until September 30, 1969, when J. Russell Peltz had his first promotion of his Hall-of-Fame career. Peltz set a then-site attendance record of 1,606 in his first of many cards at the Blue Horizon. Peltz would leave the Blue in 1971 after 31 cards to promote at bigger venues like the Arena and the Spectrum, but would return in 1974. Peltz would promote more fights at the Blue Horizon than anyone else in its history. The Peltz era brought Philadelphia greats such as Matthew Saad Muhammad, Bernard Hopkins, Cyclone Hart, Tim Witherspoon, Willie Monroe, Boogaloo Watts, Sammy Goss, Jeff Chandler and Bennie Briscoe.  Peltz left the Blue Horizon in 2001, came back to promote one card in 2004 and three cards in 2009 for the last time.

In 1994, the site was purchased by Vernoca L. Michael, Carol P. Ray, and Carol M.A. Whitaker. In 1998, Vernoca Michael became licensed as the first female African American boxing promoter in the state of Pennsylvania. She has promoted bouts since featuring established fighters such as Eddie Chambers, Yusef Mack, and Lajuan Simon.

On December 2, 1997, the venue held its first world title fight when Peltz promoted Charles Brewer in a defense of his International Boxing Federation super middleweight crown. The Blue Horizon has also hosted international, regional and state title fights.

In 2008, Ms. Michael was named one of Top 50 Women in Business in the State of Pennsylvania by Governor Ed Rendell. Michael has worked to make the building a cultural center for the surrounding neighborhood by creating a learning center with connections to Temple University and the University of Pennsylvania and a Philadelphia Boxing Museum. The venue also hosts special events, meetings, receptions, weddings, and cabarets.

The Blue Horizon appears in the film Rocky V as some fight scenes involving Tommy Morrison's character ""Tommy Gunn"" were filmed there. The building was also used to film the boxing scenes in the movie Annapolis.

The Blue Horizon was closed, reportedly due to tax problems, in June 2010. In January 2011, it was announced that $6 million had been granted to help West Philadelphia developer Mosaic Development Partners build an $18 million hotel-and-restaurant complex with a jazz bar and fitness center at the site of the Blue Horizon. In July 2013, Mosaic's plans called for the venue to be demolished in order to make way for a parking garage.

As of July 2016, the venue along with the upgraded boxing ring remains untouched, abandoned and in remarkably good-to-pristine condition with virtually no signs of any interior damage or structural problems since its closing in 2010.

999,"['The NM149 replace the Kongsberged M59F1 in the Norwegian Army .', 'The NM149 stock is laminateded beech veneer , pillar bed and is adjustable for length of pull via a spacer system , the barrel is a German made cold - hammered barrel with 4 grooves right hand twist , of heavy contour and the system shoots very well .', 'The system was very capableed and effective and serve in the Norwegian army from 1988 to 2013 .']","The NM149 sniper rifle was developed by Våpensmia A/S in close cooperation with the Norwegian Army and is based on the tried and true Mauser M98 controlled feed bolt action. These actions originate from Mauser Karabiner 98k rifles left by German armed forces in Norway at the end of World War II in 1945. It is used by both the Norwegian military and police forces, though it was originally designed at the request of the Norwegian Army. The NM149 replaced the Kongsberg M59F1 in the Norwegian Army.

The NM149 stock is laminated beech veneer, pillar bedded and is adjustable for length of pull via a spacer system, the barrel is a German made cold-hammered barrel with 4 grooves right hand twist, of heavy contour and the system shoots very well. There was a problem with the early versions of the stock cracking, but that problem has since been solved. The rifles have an easily adjustable match quality trigger, but come from the factory with a pull weight of only 1.5 kg (3.3 lbs). The standard telescopic sight for the Norwegian military and police is a Schmidt & Bender 6×42, but the scope rings are basically NATO standard, and can be removed and replaced with rings which allow the mounting of other Western telescopic sights. They can also be removed entirely, and replaced with a mount allowing the use of most NATO-compatible night vision devices. The rifles were given the serial numbers of the Schmidt & Bender 6×42 telescopic sight to make a matching pair. The system was very capable and effective and served in the Norwegian army from 1988 to 2013. It was replaced in service by the Heckler & Koch HK417.

An improved model, the NM149-F1, has since been developed and produced. It has a better and stronger laminated and weatherproofed beech stock, and German Heym heavy contour barrel (diameter 21mm) with a permanent front sight, and a flash suppressor from the AG-3 service rifle. The stock is not pillar bedded, which makes it somewhat more susceptible to weather changes.
A bipod and suppressor can be fitted as needed.
