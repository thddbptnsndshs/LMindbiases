62,['Quakerism is What ?'],"Edward Grubb (19 October 1854 – 23 January 1939) was an influential English Quaker who made significant contributions to revitalizing pacifism and a concern for social issues in the Religious Society of Friends in the late 19th century as a leader of the movement known as the Quaker Renaissance.  He also wrote a number of hymns including Our God, to Whom we turn.   He would later play a major role in the No-Conscription Fellowship, an organization that united and supported conscientious objectors in Britain during World War One.

Early career
Grubb was born in Sudbury, Suffolk, educated at Bootham School, York and studied at the University of Leeds and University of London.   He began his career as a teacher when he returned to Bootham School in York, England. Bootham is a boarding school for boys of the Religious Society of Friends. Grubb had attended the school himself, beginning in 1868 at the age of fourteen. He would later move on to teach at a number of other schools, including other Quaker schools. He received his B.A. in 1876 and in 1877 married Emma M. Horsnail of Bulford Mill, who he had courted for seven years.

Struggles with faith and science
While preparing for his M.A. examination in 1879, he had a crisis of faith resulting from his inability to reconcile science with the religious beliefs he had grown up with. He initially found it impossible to see how any serious intellectual could also be religious. He did not find any satisfaction in agnosticism; however, and remained open to a solution to his intellectual problems that included belief in God. In the 1880s Grubb began to develop an interest in social concerns, even cutting back on his teaching in order to devote time to the study of economics and to public work. In keeping with his desire to reconcile faith with science, Grubb was among those who vocally and successfully opposed the adoption of the Richmond Declaration by London Yearly Meeting in 1888. Soon after, as a result of his regular participation in meeting for worship, Grubb was officially recorded as a minister in the Religious Society of Friends. At the time, he still did not feel he had a firm basis for his faith, but was confident that it would come with time.

Major contributions
Grubb would go on to be a major leader of British Quakerism, a prolific religious author, and a key member of a number of religious and social organizations, including the No-Conscription Fellowship.  Like most pacifists of his generation, his absolute pacifist stance was born from the disillusionment with the Boer War.  From 1901 to 1906 he was secretary of the Howard Association.

Death and final resting place
The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography records that Grubb was buried on 26 January 1939 at the Hitchin Quaker burial ground.  However, the Hertford & Hitchin Monthly Meeting minutes of 4 February 1939 state quite clearly: ""He was cremated at Golders Green 27th 1. 39., the death having been registered at Letchworth 25th 1st mo. 1939"".

She is a science graduate who went on to pursue her M.A in English and B.S. in Communication from Bangalore University. She started her career at The City Tab, a Bangalore weekly tabloid, in the 1980s and worked at Deccan Herald from 1986–93, after which she co-founded the Asian College of Journalism in Bangalore.

In 2005, Dronequill published her first novel, Black Lentil Doughnuts, followed by Dreams for the Dying (2008) and Seven Days to Somewhere (2012). She has also co-authored a handbook on adoption. She co-authored the first non academic book on disability titled The Invisible Majority: India's Abled Disabled (2021). She has been writing ""City Lights"", a fortnightly column, for The Hindu Metro Plus since 2002.

Writing style

In her own words, ""Writing is so deliberate, one is working at it all the time, trying to create an effect, so there’s less spontaneity, but at the same time, one is also saying it out aloud in one's head, telling the story to an imaginary audience. I love telling stories, and hearing stories; I am a shameless eavesdropper, and I can be totally poker-faced; I can even hear things said in an undertone.""

Charumathi Supraja reckons after doing an interview with her, ""Meena decimates stereotypes in her writing. She etches out real “characters” in her stories. There’s a swagger to her writing that’s not conceited – just original. You’ll find a chuckle beneath many a line. Lush, leisurely descriptions don’t fit Meena’s writing persona. But don’t expect to drop the book till you’ve followed every twist, sparkle and glint in her neatly laid out story.""

Meena was influenced by T G Vaidyanathan.

Feminism
Meena is a feminist. From one of her interviews, ""Why are women in the centre? Not the man but the woman. For me, women are in the centre, whether I like it or not. It’s possibly linked to the feminist perspective that I have always had. Somehow when I start writing I find that it’s the women who take centre stage, the men are either not very nice guys (laughs) or are incidental.""

Works
Her first novel, Black Lentil Doughnuts was published in 2005. In it, Meena talks about Shanthi and her alter-ego Lilly who escape the oppressive warmth of their small town to taste the freedom of an emerging metropolis. Shanthi is seduced by the anarchism of the Three Mosquitoes, while Lilly's seductions are on more predictable lines. But all the while they are being stalked by an insane mass hysteria that sees them as outsiders C K Meena takes the readers on a roller coaster ride through the love and hate, gentleness and brutality that is metropolitan India.

Lady Six Sky (possibly Lady Wak Chanjalam Lem/Win? in ancient Mayan), also known as Lady Wac Chanil Ahau or Wak Chanil Ajaw (d. 741 CE), was a Maya queen of Naranjo who was born in Dos Pilas. She lived in Naranjo from 682 to her death (or shortly before her death) in 741. During that time, she probably served as de facto ruler of the city; however, monuments such as Stela 24 suggest she was never formally recognized as such, since she continued to use the emblem glyph of Dos Pilas throughout her life.

Because the reading of her name is currently contested, scholars typically refer to her as Lady Six Sky, which is the English translation of a readable portion of her name (Wak Chan meaning Six Sky).

Monuments that refer to Lady Six Sky include: Naranjo stelae 3, 18, 24, 29, 31, and 46.

 Personal life 
Lady Six Sky was the daughter of B'alaj Chan K'awiil of Dos Pilas and a woman who may have been named Lady B'ulu ? or Lady B'uluka'l. Though Lady B'ulu was not B'alaj Chan K'awiil's first wife, she carried the prestigious title ochk'in kalo'mte  (loosely, ""western autocrat"") on Stela 24, suggesting a high level of political power.

In 682 CE, Lady Six Sky arrived in Naranjo to establish a new dynasty at the behest of her father. She was part of an arranged marriage between the Maya cities of Dos Pilas and Naranjo (in modern Guatemala) to bring Naranjo into the Calakmul–Dos Pilas alliance. This may have been a direct response to Tikal's recent defeat of Calakmul.

Little is known about her husband, though he may have been a low-status cousin of the previous king, K’ahk’ Xiiw Chan Chaahk. This king had been defeated two years earlier by Caracol, leaving a power vacuum. Her husband's name appears on Naranjo Stela 46. Though the reading is not yet fully deciphered, it was something like K'ak' U ? Chan Chaak.

During her time in Naranjo, she presumably served as ruler of the city, though in text (such as on stelae 24 and 29), she still carried the title of Holy Lady of Dos Pilas. A little more than five years after her arrival, on January 6, 688, she gave birth to a son, the future king of Naranjo Kʼakʼ Tiliw Chan Chaak. His birth is commemorated among other high points of the queen's life on stelae 24 and 29.

For many years, scholars debated if K'ak' Tiliw was her son or not, but the more recently discovered Stela 46, which was discovered in 2017, includes a definitive relationship statement between the two.

Their relationship may have been an uneasy one; Christophe Helmke notes that the queen erected monuments that centered herself as ruler well into K'ak' Tiliw Chan Chaak's adulthood, suggesting that she competed with him for power and influence. K'ak' Tiliw Chan Chaak died of unknown causes in his early forties, and Lady Six Sky seems to have promoted a new ruler, Yax Mayuy Chan Chaak. This ruler appears on Naranjo Stela 18 in text that was probably a late addition to the monument; here, his presence at important events, including a star war with Komkom, are used to imply his fitness to rule. He may have been a younger brother of K'ak' Tiliw Chan Chaak.

A name that is probably hers appears in reference to a scattering ritual at Dos Pilas on February 10 or 11, 741; this may be the date of her death, though this fact is contested.

 Daykeeper and Warrior-Queen 
Despite never receiving the title Holy Lady of Naranjo, Lady Six Sky commissioned monuments in Naranjo that note she performed important rituals, some shortly after her arrival. For example, Stela 29 describes a burning ritual on August 31 682 CE, just three days after her arrival in Naranjo. But her early days in Naranjo may have been beset by rival claims to the throne, and she did not begin seriously commissioning monuments until almost two decades into her rule.

That said, she may have been responsible for a method of counting moon phases that spread during the Period of Uniformity; during this time, Glyph C values across the Maya area remained consistent. She had a penchant for celebrating the rare ""Tikal Cycle"" period endings which happened on #.#.3.0.0 days of the Maya Long Count calendar; she celebrated 9.13.3.0.0 (March 1, 695 CE) and 9.14.3.0.0 (November 17, 714 CE), both memorialized on Stela 29.

She also supervised the production of high-quality pottery, a trend which continued during the rule of her son, who became known as Pure (or White) Artisan for his patronage of the arts.

Additionally, she is shown on monuments taking on the role of a warrior-king by standing over a trampled captive, an unusual representation for a woman. Naranjo Stela 24 from April 17, 699 CE, is one such depiction; there, she stands on a captive from the small polity of K'inichil Kab. Stela 29 from November 17, 714 CE also shows her standing on a captive, though it is too eroded to make out the captive's name or place of origin. Besides K'inichil Kab, she was involved in the sacking of at least nine other polities, and she waged a victorious war against the Komkom polity in April 726 CE, according to Stela 18. Her son K'ak' Tiliw Chan Chaak and future Naranjo leader Yax Mayuy Chan Chaak were also both involved.

On Stela 24, she also appears dressed in the net skirt of the maize god, another uncommon trait for women. She may have taken the name ""Six"" because of its association with the maize god, though she also emphasized her relationship with the moon goddess. The combination of maize god and moon goddess symbolism may have been a deliberate message that the ruler was capable of both masculine and feminine roles.

For example, on Stela 24, she is described as ub'aah (short for ub'aahila'n) ti yax k'uh, ""she is portrayed as the first god,"" meaning she was seen as literally serving as a vessel for this god. On the side of Stela 24, this ritual is described in more detail; here the god is referred to as the moon goddess despite the net skirt which was worn mostly by men. This ritual took place on April 17, 699 CE. According to Stela 47, she also impersonated the moon goddess on February 9, 726 CE, which was the Maya new year, following the 260-day sacred calendar.

When K'ahk' Tiliw Chan Chaak was about 13, his mother was the one who publicly celebrated the half-k'atun anniversary of 9.14.10.0.0 (October 11, 721 CE) with the erection of Stela 24, suggesting she was serving as his regent at that time. However, she may never have been the formal head of government; Stela 24 described K’ak’ Tiliw Chan Chaak as the 38th head of Naranjo's government, whereas it should count him as the 39th if Six Sky were included.

 Rediscovery in the 20th Century 
Tatiana Proskouriakoff first recognized the name of the queen in the 1960s during her pioneering studies of the historical side of Maya inscriptions. She nicknamed the queen ""Lady of Tikal"" because of the use of the Mutal emblem glyph; it wasn't until later that scholars realized more than one city used the same glyph.

 In popular culture 
 Lady Six Sky leads the Mayan civilization in the New Frontier season pass of the 4X video game Civilization VI.
 She is the subject of the 2012 historical fiction Lady Six Sky'' by Elaine Lowe and has been depicted in contemporary art by Miguel Omaña.

In 2005, the Comprehensive Peace Agreement led to a resolution of some of the armed conflict in Sudan, including the 2011 South Sudanese independence referendum and the secession of South Sudan. The 2006 Abuja and 2011 Doha Darfur Peace Agreements aimed to resolve the conflict in Darfur. The August 2019 Draft Constitutional Declaration, signed by military and civilian representatives during the 2018–19 Sudanese Revolution, requires that a peace agreement be made within the first six months of the 39-month transition period to democratic civilian government. This article mainly covers the component of the peace process that started in 2019.

A first round of negotiations took place in Juba in mid-September. In the second round in October 2019, agreements were signed on 18 October on the Two Areas track between the government and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement-North (al-Hilu) (SPLM-N (al-Hilu)) and on the Darfur track between the government and the Sudan Revolutionary Front (SRF). The third round started in mid-December on the eastern Sudan track, the Two Areas track with the SPLM-N (Agar), and the Darfur track.

MANSAM and the No to Oppression against Women Initiative called repeatedly for women to be included in the peace process.

Draft constitutional requirements
The 4 August Draft Constitutional Declaration lists ""achieving a just and comprehensive peace, ending the war by addressing the roots of the Sudanese problem"" as Article 7.(1), the first listed item in its ""Mandate of the Transitional Period"", and gives details in Chapter 15, Articles 67 and 58 of the document. Article 67.(b) says that a peace agreement should be completed within six months of the signing of the Draft Constitutional Declaration. Article 67.(c) requires women to participate in all levels of the peace procedure and for United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325 to be applied, and legal establishment of women's rights is covered in Article 67.(d). Other mechanisms for implementing the comprehensive peace process are listed in Articles 67.(e) (stopping hostilities, opening humanitarian assistance corridors, prisoner releases and exchanges), 67.(f) (amnesties for political leaders and members of armed opposition movements), and 67.(g) (transitional justice and accountability for crimes against humanity and war crimes and trials in national and international courts). Article 68 lists 13 ""essential issues for peace negotiations"".

Conflict incidents
During mid-September to mid-November 2019, 40 assaults by Sudanese security forces against civilians took place in Darfur, in which civilians were killed or wounded, in Mershing, Shangil Tobai, Gray Kalakl, Andro, Kadner, Mukjar, Gereida and Krenk. A representative of internally displace people (IDPs) described the security situation as unchanged since the power transfer from the Transitional Military Council to the civilian–military Sovereignty Council and civilian cabinet.

Armed clashes between state security forces and Sudan Liberation Movement/Army (al-Nur; SLM-al-Nur) occurred. , SLM (al-Nur) refused to join the Juba peace process.

Geographical negotiation tracks
The peace negotiations were classified into parallel tracks on five geographical regions:
Darfur: a political agreement including a ceasefire and humanitarian assistance was signed by Hemetti and the SRF on 21 October 2019; a framework agreement was signed on 28 December 2019; a final peace agreement was signed on 31 August 2020;

Negotiations and agreements

September 2019 Juba negotiations
In September 2019, following the transfer of power from the Transitional Military Council to the Sovereignty Council of Sudan, South Sudanese president Salva Kiir hosted talks in Juba between rebel movements, military members of the Sovereignty Council, and the Sudanese prime minister. Rebel movements involved in the Juba meetings included four Darfuri armed groups, the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM), the Sudan Liberation Movement/Army led by Minni Minawi (SLM-MM), the Sudan Liberation Movement–Transitional Council, and the Alliance of Sudan Liberation Forces; the Blue Nile/South Kordofan rebel group Sudan People's Liberation Movement-North al-Hilu faction (SPLM-N (al-Hilu)); and the Sudan-wide Sudan Revolutionary Front (SRF) that in 2011 allied together a wide range of Sudanese armed rebel groups. Hemetti, Sovereignty Council military member and leader of the Rapid Support Forces, arrived in Juba for the negotiations on 9 September.

Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok and three cabinet ministers planned to arrive in Juba on 12 September for the negotiations.

Sudan researcher Eric Reeves expressed scepticism about the possibility of Hemetti being ""ready to make peace"", arguing that Hemetti was responsible for crimes against humanity and genocide during the wars in Darfur and South Kordofan.

October 2019 signed agreements
On 18 October, two separate meetings took place in Juba between rebel and Sovereignty Council (head of state) representatives, on the Two Areas and Darfur tracks.

In the Two Areas track, after a three-hour negotiating session mediated by a South Sudanese mediation team, Amar Daldoum, on behalf of the SPLM-N (al-Hilu) and Shams al-Din Khabbashi, on behalf of the Sovereignty Council signed an agreement on political, security and humanitarian procedures. The agreement was cosigned by the chair of the mediation team, Tut Galwak. The SPLM-N (al-Hilu) and the Sovereignty Council planned to develop a Declaration of Principles to organise continuation of the peace process and to present their political vision.

Independently on 18 October, the first Darfur track meeting between the SRF and Sovereignty Council representatives took place under South Sudanese mediation, creating a joint committee. The joint committee stated its intention to study the 11 September Juba Declaration, and propose how to move from confidence-building measures to negotiations on core issues. On 21 October, el-Hadi Idris, on behalf of the SRF, and Hemetti, on behalf of the Sovereignty Council signed a political agreement (co-signed by a South Sudanese mediator) including a renewed ceasefire, the delivering of humanitarian assistance by government agencies to areas under conflict, and commitment to negotiate further.

Following the 18 October meetings, Tut Galwak stated that Sudan, South Sudan and other African countries are committed ""to end all forms of war"" in Africa by the end of 2020.

December talks
The third round of negotiations started in Juba in mid-December 2019, after having been planned to start on 21 November 2019. The negotiation round was delayed for several weeks because of ""the commitment of some of the armed movements to workshops related to the peace process"", according to South Sudanese mediator Tut Galwak. The Forces of Freedom and Change (FFC) agreed with the SRF to delay the creation of the Transitional Legislative Council to 31 December, giving the SRF, SPLM-N (al-Hilu) and the government time to reach an agreement prior to the creation of the Legislative Council.

On 16 December, the SRF and ""government representatives"" discussed the eastern Sudan track. The government representatives wished to suspend talks until ""civil leaders and prominent figures"" from eastern Sudan were included; the SRF refused to wait, arguing that it would ""[contradict] the Juba Declaration"" and ""hamper the negotiation tracks [which] are all intertwined"".

On 17 December, on the Two Areas track, Hemetti and Malik Agar, head of SPLM-N (Agar), signed an agreement establishing a ""humanitarian protocol and a ceasefire"". The agreement includes a ceasefire monitoring group with three representatives from both sides and a South Sudanese chair, to be located in Khartoum, with a sub-office in Kadugli and another in Ed Damazin; and the sending of a joint mission to the Two Areas to assess humanitarian needs and plan and carry out a humanitarian action plan.

On 19 December, in the Darfur track, the SRF and government representatives created a committee, called a joint mechanism, for visiting Darfur with the help of the United Nations–African Union Mission in Darfur (UNAMID) in order to select ""real representatives of the stakeholders"". UNAMID committed itself to providing transport of the stakeholders to Juba for the negotiations. El Hadi Idris of the SRF described the creation of the mechanism as ""an important breakthrough"". Detailed Darfur track negotiations were expected to continue in Juba for several weeks.

South Sudanese mediator Dams Dhieu Mathok stated that ""participation of refugees, displaced people and civil society leaders"" was being negotiated and would constitute a critical element of the Darfur peace process.

In the Two Areas track, Mathok stated that the proposal was provided by the SPLM-N (al-Hilu) delegation to government representatives.

On 24 December, Hemetti on behalf of the Sovereignty Council and el-Tom Hajo, deputy head of the SRF and head of the Central track negotiation team, signed a peace agreement regarding ""development, farmers' issues, the El Gezira and El Managil Agricultural Scheme, land rights, in addition to a fair distribution of wealth"". Hajo described the agreement as ""inclusive"" without ""quotas or positions"".

Four Darfur representatives and Khabbashi signed a framework agreement on 28 December for the Darfur track, covering issues that included power sharing, wealth sharing, transitional justice and Darfur–Darfur dialogue. On 31 December, the SRF suspended talks on the Darfur track in relation to fighting in that killed and wounded 708 people in el-Geneina. An FFC delegation visiting the area attributed the conflict to ""the deep state"" and victims attributed it to ""janjaweed"" and ""militant herders in vehicles belonging to the Rapid Support Forces"".

January 2020 agreements
On 21 January, negotiations on the eastern track were suspended until 30 January, because a consultative forum preparing for the negotiations was not inclusive enough of representatives from the Red Sea state, and too many supporters of al-Bashir's government were present in the forum.

Progress on land, transitional justice and system of government issues was made in the Darfur track on 21 January. SRF and Sovereignty Council representatives agreed on the creation of a Special Court for Darfur to conduct investigations and trials for war crimes and crimes against humanity carried out during the War in Darfur by the al-Bashir presidency and by warlords. The issue of whether or not to surrender Omar al-Bashir to the International Criminal Court was not discussed in the 21 January negotiations.

Two Areas negotiations with SPLM-N (al-Hilu) had progressed by 21 January on six framework agreement points, after a two-week pause, but disagreement remained on SPLM-N (al-Hilu)'s requirement of a secular state in South Kordofan and Nuba Mountains and Blue Nile self-determination.

On 22 January, talks on the northern track with the SRF were suspended in relation to deciding how to respect the rights of the displaced from Wadi Halfa.

On 24 January on the Two Areas track, political and security agreements, constituting a framework agreement, were signed by Hemetti on behalf of the Sovereignty Council and Ahmed El Omda Badi on behalf of SPLM-N (Agar). The agreements give legislative autonomy to South Kordofan and Blue Nile; propose solutions for the sharing of land and other resources; and aim to unify all militias and government soldiers into a single unified Sudanese military body.

On 26 January, a ""final"" peace agreement for the northern track, including issues of studies for new dams, compensation for people displaced by existing dams, road construction and burial of electronic and nuclear waste, was signed by Shamseldin Kabashi of the Sovereignty Council and Dahab Ibrahim of the Kush Movement.

February 2020 agreements
On 21 February 2020, a final agreement was made on the eastern track. The terms of the agreement included increased representation of eastern Sudan in the federal governmental structures; the establishment of a locally funded reconstruction fund; and the establishment of an internationally funded eastern Sudanese private bank to support political, educational, health and other administrative structures.

Agreements during the COVID-19 pandemic
Negotiations continued during the COVID-19 pandemic that reached Sudan in early 2020.

On 25 March, Sudan's defence minister Gamal al-Din Omar died of a heart attack in Juba after peace talks with rebel groups. Peace talks after al-Din Omar's death resumed on 2 April.

While talks in the Darfur track were ongoing, SLM (Minnawi) and JEM withdrew from the SRF in mid-May 2020, while continuing their alliance with each other and giving their new alliance the same name (Sudan Revolutionary Front). , the SLM (al-Nur) continued to boycott peace negotiations while waiting for the national authorities to make Darfur secure.

August 2020: integration of Sudan Revolutionary Front into army
On 17 August 2020, Khalid Abdin for the government, and Ahmed el-Omda for the SPLM-N (Agar) signed a security agreement for the Two Areas that included the integration of the armed forces of the Sudan Revolutionary Front into the Sudanese Armed Forces. Negotiations on political issues continued in the following days.

Negotiations with SPLM-N (al-Hilu) were planned to start around 21 August, discussing a declaration of principles, a ceasefire, and humanitarian aid.

31 August 2020 Juba peace agreement
On 31 August 2020, a comprehensive peace agreement was signed between the Sovereignty Council and the SRF, which includes SPLM-N (Minnawi) and JEM for the Darfur track and SPLM-N (Agar) for the Two Areas track. Under the terms of the agreement, the factions that signed will be entitled to three seats on the sovereignty council, a total of five ministers in the transitional cabinet and a quarter of seats in the transitional legislature. At a regional level, signatories will be entitled between 30 and 40% of the seats on transitional legislatures of their home states or regions.

3 September 2020 Addis Ababa peace agreement 
An agreement was reached between the transitional government and the SPLM-North al-Hilu rebel faction on 3 September 2020 in Addis Ababa to separate religion and state and not discriminate against anyone's ethnicity in order to secure the equal treatment of all citizens of Sudan. The declaration of principles stated that 'Sudan is a multi-racial, multi-ethnic, multi-religious and multi-cultural society. Full recognition and accommodation of these diversities must be affirmed. (...) The state shall not establish an official religion. No citizen shall be discriminated against based on their religion.' Secularism had long been a demand of the SPLM-North al-Hilu, with a spokesperson saying: 'The problem is (...) to address why people became rebels? Because there are no equal citizenship rights, there is no distribution of wealth, there is no equal development in the country, there is no equality between black and Arab and Muslim and Christian.'

3 October 2020 Juba peace agreement 
A peace agreement was signed between the SRF, SPLM–N led by Malik Agar and SLM led by Minni Minnawi and the Sudanese government, with the absence of both al Nur and al-Hilu. However, the deal included terms to integrate rebels into the security forces, and to grant them political representation and economic and land rights, in addition to a 10-year plan to invest $750 million to develop southern and western regions, and to guarantee the return for displaced people.

Women's participation
On 12 November, Ahlam Nasir, on behalf of Women of Sudanese Civic and Political Groups (MANSAM), met Sovereignty Council member Mohammed al-Ta'ishi, arguing that women should be included in the peace negotiations. Nasir presented specific proposals for women's participation in the negotiations and MANSAM's priorities in the peace process. According to Neville Melvin Gertze of Namibia who spoke at an October 2019 meeting of the United Nations Security Council, peace agreements that are the result of negotiations including women are 35 percent more likely to last at least 15 years than those which are the result of men-only negotiations.

On 17 December, the No to Oppression against Women Initiative requested the Sovereignty Council to include women, ""especially displaced women and war victims"", in the Sudanese peace process. Ihsan Fagiri of the Initiative described women's view of the peace process as extending beyond the formal signing of national-level agreements, by including ""social peace, and health and education"" and by Sudan signing the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women.

214,"[""Lost Most 's Who album their towards working slowly , 2000 in   Arcades form to on went pair The ?""]","David Prior (born 1972 in Ipswich, United Kingdom) is a British sound artist and composer.

Early work
David Prior was born in the UK and studied Music and Religious Studies at the University of Wales, Bangor where he studied composition with Andrew Lewis. He was awarded the prize for composition in his final year for his piece Dense which went on to win a Prix de Residence at the 1996 Bourges International Electroacoustic Music Competition , leading to a residency at Xenakis' UPIC studio in Paris the following year. The piece was short-listed by the Society for the Promotion of New Music (SPNM) and following a performance at the Purcell Room in 1998, it was selected by then SPNM artistic director Howard Skempton for the George Butterworth award.

From Bangor, Prior went on to study composition with Jonty Harrison at the University of Birmingham, graduating with a PhD in 2001. During his time in Birmingham, Prior's work was often concerned with integrating acoustic space as a compositional parameter in his work. This theme stimulated interests which still define the work he is involved in today, whether that be through his installations, sound-walks, acousmatic compositions or the sound designs he has made for museums and galleries. Another feature of the work Prior was producing during this period but less evident in more recent projects, was the attempt to assimilate free improvisation into the devising of his ultimately 'fixed' compositions, for example Somewhere Submarine (1996), for piano and tape (joint winner of the 1997 Cornelius Cardew Composition Competition) and Another Poisonous Sunset (1998).

Prior was awarded a Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst (DAAD) stipendium in 1999, funding a one-year residency at the Technische Universität Berlin, where he completed the work submitted for his PhD. Following the completion of his residency, he stayed living in Berlin, undertaking a commission from the DAAD Kunstlerprogram which led to his twenty-four channel acousmatic piece Love and Death, premiered at the Parochialkirche, Berlin as part of the Inventionen festival, 2000.
In 1997, Prior collaborated with Swiss choreographers Jürg Koch and R. Lucia Baumgartner on the piece an die Materie and the music from this piece went on to win an honorary mention at the 1998 Bourges International Electroacoustic Music Competition  and first prize in the 1998 EAR (Hungarian Radio) composition prize. When Koch went on to join CandoCo dance company, he worked with Prior again, commissioning him to write the score for Amaze in You in 2002.

Liminal: sound and architecture
Prior first collaborated with architect Frances Crow in 1997 on Triptych, an installation jointly commissioned by SPNM and the Southbank Centre, London. They worked together again on the Arts Council funded Good Vibrations children's education project in 1999 but it wasn't until 2003 that they formally established Liminal, a design studio with a particular interest in exploring sound and architecture. The partnership has resulted in projects ranging from installations to sound-walks as well as commercial sound design and consultancy and a number of theoretical publications and conference papers. Liminal was formed as a company in order to undertake Swash (2003), a large-scale, immersive sound installation for Living Coasts in Devon and in keeping with other recent work, this piece has evolved into a number of different iterations. Two years after the completion of the installation version of Swash, Prior made an eight-channel, acousmatic concert version of the piece which was first performed at the Martin Harris Hall in Manchester as part of the Sonic Arts Expo, 2006. In 2007, Prior was commissioned by the SpACE-Net spatial audio research group in York to produce a third, improvised version of the work which has been performed a number of times subsequently. Following the completion of Swash, liminal were made lead sound designers for the Churchill Museum in London designed by celebrated designers Casson Mann. The Churchill Museum has gone on to win a string of awards and was nominated for both the D&AD Award for Outstanding Achievement in Digital Installations and the 2006 Gulbenkian Prize.

Since 2006, liminal have been involved as lead artists in the Warwick Bar development in Birmingham. Their work on this project involved close collaboration with masterplanning architects Kinetic-AIU and has since been cited as an exemplar for artist-architect collaborations by CABE, who part-funded liminal's involvement through their PROJECT fund and features as a case-study in their Artists & Places publication. It was during this project that liminal developed their use of the sound-walk as a research tool, in this instance consolidating the extensive research undertaken into the soundscape of the Warwick Bar site into a binaural walk available to the public. Liminal later contributed to the Cotswold Water Park's twenty-year strategic plan, working with masterplanning consultants Scott Wilson and building on the research techniques they developed for the Warwick Bar project on a series of proposals which address the soundscape of the water park.  Liminal's recent work has focussed on the creation of 'listening spaces', whether this takes the form of a site-specific sound-walk, such as Black Water Brown Water (2008) or architectural interventions such as Song Pole with poet Larry Lynch (2008), the point of departure for these pieces is to create a reflexive listening experience for the audience; focussing attention back onto the act of listening itself.

In 2010 they were awarded £50,000 to create ""The Organ of Corti"" to 'recycle' and create new sounds.

Other sound and music collaborations
Prior began working with New Zealander Dugal McKinnon in 1998 on a composed radio documentary Ways of Hearing  for Resonance FM as part of John Peel's Meltdown festival at the Southbank Centre, London.  The pair went on to form Arcades  in 2000, slowly working towards their album Who's Most Lost? which was completed in late 2007.  Meanwhile, Prior was also asked by UK songwriter John Matthias to produce two tracks on his Ninja Tune release Stories From the Water Cooler.  Prior and Matthias went on to form Derailer, whose first project was to remix a track by Corker Conboy called Radiant Idiot.  The resulting Radiant Idiot Remake, was chosen by American independent film-maker Harmony Korine for his Thornton's television commercial Stuck. The pair have remixed work by John Richards as well as working towards an album of original material.  Prior also remixed John Matthias and Nick Ryan's Cortical Songs, released on the non-classical label.  Prior has recorded and/or produced work for artists and ensembles including Icebreaker, Nicola Hitchcock and Michael Bassett as well as contributing sound designs to films by artists Jane Grant and Anya Lewin.  In 2007, Prior was invited by improvising vocalist Steve Lewis to join Antti Sakari Saario in providing live electronics for his Flocking project based around an improvising ensemble.  Since 2002, Prior has been working with his brother Andrew Prior on a series of collaborative music projects. Their piece Gem Sprinter features on the Yacht Club compilation release Pallomeri under the moniker Orlando Hooks.

Films
Since 2002, Prior has made a series of short films often characterized by their brevity and simplicity.  On a number of these films, Prior has collaborated with poet Larry Lynch, who as well as contributing texts often features in the films themselves.  Their collaboration On What it Might Mean to be Spinning features the voice of poet John Hall and was premiered in February 2008 as part of the Voices III festival in Plymouth, UK.  Prior's films have been screened across the UK, in Russia, Korea, China, Sweden, Holland and the USA.

Awards
Prior's work has won prizes including a number of awards from the Bourges International Electroacoustic Music Competition, Cornelius Cardew Prize, E.A.R (the composition prize of Hungarian National Radio), the George Butterworth prize and a PRS ATOM award. Prior has received awards from the University of Birmingham Alumni award, M.J. West Foundation, the Arts Council of England, the Banff Centre for the Arts, the DAAD and UNESCO.

Academic work
Prior began teaching in the music department at the University of Birmingham in the late 1990s while a post-graduate student there. Since 2001, Prior has been a lecturer, then senior lecturer in music at Dartington College of Arts, Devon.  Prior has given guest lectures and presentations around the world at institutions including the Icelandic Academy of Arts, Reykjavík, Stadia Helsinki Polytechnic and ESMAE School of Music and Performing Arts, Polytechnic Institute of Porto.

Personal life
Prior lives with Frances Crow in Totnes, Devon.

426,['History Genesis Is film documentary creationist 2017 the in appeared Snelling ?'],"Andrew A. Snelling is a young-Earth creationist geologist who works for Answers in Genesis.

Education and career
Snelling has a Ph.D. in geology from the University of Sydney from 1982.

He was, for a decade, the geology spokesman for the Creation Science Foundation, the coordinating center for creationism in Australia.  He started working for Answers in Genesis in 2007 and serves as AiG's director of research.
 
Snelling has been published in standard geological publications estimating the age of geological specimens in billions of years, but has also written articles for creationist journals in which he supports a young-earth creationism viewpoint. He worked in the RATE project.

Snelling appeared in the 2017 creationist documentary film Is Genesis History?

Discrimination allegation lawsuit
Snelling, like other young-Earth creationists, believes the Grand Canyon formed after the Biblical flood;  the rocks in Grand Canyon were formed billions of years ago and the Grand Canyon itself was formed millions of years ago.  In 2013 Snelling applied for a permit to collect 50-60 half-pound rocks from the park. The application was denied because the National Park Service screens applications to take material from the Grand Canyon, to protect it.  One of the three geologists who reviewed the proposal for the National Park Service stated that the type of rock Snelling was trying to test could be found outside the park, and all three reviewers made it clear they did not consider the proposal scientifically valid.

Snelling submitted a revised proposal in 2016.  In a letter dated May 5, 2017, the NPS said it found the application acceptable and it was willing to grant it if changes were made to locations and methods of collecting rocks; Snelling proposed to chisel away rocks and to do so from highly visible rock faces, to take samples from land that was not parkland but rather was on an Indian reservation and also from another location that was likely to have archeological remains.  The NPS had authorized a river trip for Snelling to survey locations but not to collect specimens; Snelling objected that this would take too much time and expense, and in response in the May 5 letter, the NPS offered to have staff work with Snelling to map locations in a meeting or conference call.

On May 9, 2017, Snelling, with the help of the Alliance Defending Freedom, filed a religious discrimination lawsuit against the United States Department of the Interior and the Grand Canyon National Park authorities, citing the Trump administration's executive order of May 4, 2017 about religious liberty. In late June 2017 Answers in Genesis released a statement saying the National Park authorities had issued Snelling a permit to collect rock samples, and that Snelling had withdrawn the lawsuit. Snelling's attorneys did not provide a copy of the permit to a reporter from the Phoenix New Times who requested it.

Costain's 1952 novel of the same name. It was Saville's last film and marked the acting debut of Paul Newman; despite being nominated for a Golden Globe Award for his performance, Newman later called it ""the worst motion picture produced during the 1950s"".

Plot
A Greek artisan from Antioch is commissioned to cast the cup of Christ in silver and sculpt around its rim the faces of the disciples and Jesus himself. He travels to Jerusalem and eventually to Rome to complete the task. Meanwhile, a nefarious interloper is trying to convince the crowds that he is the new Messiah by using nothing more than cheap parlor tricks.

Cast
It marked the film début of Paul Newman as an artist named Basil (né Ambrose), who was given the task of making a silver chalice to house the Holy Grail. It also featured Virginia Mayo as Helena, Pier Angeli as Deborra, Jack Palance as Simon Magus, the villain, Joseph Wiseman as Mijamin, Alexander Scourby as Saint Luke, Walter Hampden as Joseph of Arimathea, Lorne Greene as Peter, and a brief appearance by Natalie Wood, who plays Helena as a young woman. It was also the feature film débuts of Greene and Robert Middleton.

Style

The film featured unusual semiabstract settings and decor, created by the stage designer Rolfe Gerard in a striking departure from the normal practice of the day for Hollywood biblical ""epics"". A notable musical score by Franz Waxman was nominated for an Academy Award.

Release

Premiere
The film had its world premiere in the small town of Saranac Lake, New York, which won a competition selling Christmas Seals. Saville, Mayo, Angeli and Palance attended, and participated in, a parade around the time of the town's annual winter carnival. The premiere itself was hosted by television personality Art Linkletter.

Home media
The film was released on VHS and, in 2009, on DVD.

Reception

Critical reception
A. H. Weiler of The New York Times wrote that the filmmakers ""have come up with a spectacle-filled adventure easily fitted to the lush hues of WarnerColor and the king-sized screen of Cinemascope. But in providing a modicum of excitement and generous portions of extravaganza they have turned out a cumbersome and sometimes creaking vehicle that takes too long to reach its goal.""

Variety wrote, ""Like the Costain book, the picture is overdrawn and sometimes tedious, but producer-director Victor Saville still manages to instill interest in what's going on, and even hits a feeling of excitement occasionally. John L. Scott of the Los Angeles Times wrote that ""it is colorful at times, rather tedious in other portions."" Richard L. Coe of The Washington Post wrote, ""Lester Samuels' screen play meanders self-consciously and Victor Saville's direction is just as overblown. I found nothing remarkable in the performances of the leads, Paul Newman (not as good as he's been on TV), Pier Angeli, Virginia Mayo (more synthetically blondined than ever), Jack Palance (an overtheatric villain), or even Walter Hampden (the ancient Joseph)."" Harrison's Reports thought the film ""deserves a high rating from the production point of view,"" but was ""only moderately interesting"" as entertainment. John McCarten of The New Yorker wrote that the film ""has to do with the pursuit of the Grail by the most dismal assortment of characters I've encountered in a decade."" The Monthly Film Bulletin wrote, ""Any true religious atmosphere in this vulgar and incongruous fancy-dress parade is out of the question ... Some may discover uproarious moments, many will be repelled by the tastelessness of the spectacle as a whole.""

Writing in the first edition of his Film Guide in 1977, Leslie Halliwell described the film as ""[p]o-faced biblical hokum ... with howlingly bad casting and direction ... [a] sea of boredom"", assigning it 0 stars out of 4.

The elaborate musical score by Franz Waxman has been prized more than the nearly forgotten movie. Elmer Bernstein recorded a suite in 1975, and Film Score Monthly released the surviving portions of the soundtrack recording in 2007.

Newman's view
Paul Newman was apparently not proud of his performance. When the film was broadcast on television in 1966, he took out an advertisement in a Hollywood trade paper apologizing for his performance, and requesting people not to watch the film. This backfired, and the broadcast received unusually high ratings. The film is sometimes referred to as Paul Newman and the Holy Grail.  Newman called the film ""the worst motion picture produced during the 1950s"", and once screened it for guests at his home, handing out pots, wooden spoons, and whistles and encouraging the audience to offer noisy critiques.

Legacy
Martin Scorsese wrote about the film as a guilty pleasure in 1978 saying:
The Silver Chalice is one of the reasons I hired Boris Leven to design New York, New York. Giant and The Silver Chalice: any man who could design those two films . . . that's it, I had to have him. The Silver Chalice, which is a bad picture, has no authenticity. It's purely theatrical, and this is mainly due to the sets. They're clean and clear; it's almost like another life, another world. We don't know what ancient Rome was like, so why not take the attitude Fellini had with Satyricon: make it science fiction in reverse? The Silver Chalice came close to that, fifteen years earlier.

560,"['Kiligai ( Division 80th and , Division 54th , Division 20th the of time the at consisted corps The ?']","The 6th Corps was a corps (a military formation) of the Afghan Army, seemingly active from 1990 to around 2003–2004. Created as a military formation of the PDPA's standing army, it degraded into a grouping of militias by its last years.

Abdul Rashid Dostum had previously commanded the Jozjani militia, which later became the 53rd Infantry Division. Numbering 40,000 men drawn from the Uzbek minority, it took its orders directly from Mohammad Najibullah. It was later termed as the 'only real mobile reserve' available to the regime. After 1989, this force was the only one capable of carrying out offensive operations.

The 80th Division was reportedly formed during the Soviet–Afghan War, after 1988. It was originally an Isma'ili-sponsored tribal Sarandoy (Interior Ministry) regiment/brigade. In 1989 it was the major formation in Baghlan Province, under the command of Sayed Jafar Naderi, the then 25-year-old son of Sayed Mansoor Naderi, 53, the religious leader of the minor Isma`ili Islamic sect in Afghanistan. Inhabiting the areas along or adjacent to the main road leading north from the Salang Tunnel, the cooperation of the Isma'ilis became indispensable to the PDPA regime so as to guarantee the security of convoys moving southwards to Kabul.

The corps was reportedly formed in 1990. General Khodaidad reportedly became chief of staff of the corps and commander of the 54th Division that year. On 18 April 1992, Kunduz, the corps headquarters, was surrendered to the Mujahideen. The corps consisted at the time of the 20th Division, 54th Division, and 80th Division (Kiligai?), and the city hosted the corps headquarters and the 54th Division headquarters. The divisional commander of 54th Division, an ethnic Pashtun, handed over the divisional base complete to the Ittehad-e-Islami leader in the Kunduz area, commander Amir Chughay. Most of the units of the corps came under the sway of Abdul Rashid Dostum's Juneshi-i-Mili Islami, or National Islamic Movement of Afghanistan.

Junbesh-i-Islami soon had a force of five divisions (the corps' three plus the 19th and 53rd Division) several independent brigades (including the 510th and 511th) and militia formations, plus police and armed units belonging to the national security (WAD). The force was theoretically 120,000 men strong, equipped with large amounts of armour and artillery, spread across seven of Afghanistan's provinces, from Maimana, to Sheberghan, home of the 53rd Division, to Pul-i-Khumri in the east. The actual total of full-time troops probably stood at around half that number.

By mid-1994 there were two parallel 6th Corps operating in the north. Dostum's 6th Corps was based at Pul-i-Khumri and had three divisions: the 20th Division (Bagh-i-Momtaz, south of Baghlan), the 54th Division (Samangan), and the 80th Division (Qilagai/Kiligai), controlled by the Naderi clan that presides over the Ismaeli. The Defence Ministry of the Kabul government's 6th Corps was based at Kunduz and also had three divisions, two sharing numbers with formations in Dostum's corps. 
Davis in JIR 1994 lists the 20th, 54th, 55th and Bakakhstan Divisions.

The 29th AMF Division was reported as responsible for the nine eastern districts of Badakhshan and was a part of Dostum's 6th Corps in Kunduz.

Brigadier General Mohammed Daoud Andrabi Khan became corps commander and was reportedly the most powerful man in Kunduz province. Daoud was a former deputy to Masoud, is Tajik, and was a member of Jamiat-i-Islami.

An arms collection effort was initiated in late November and early December 2001 by General Atiqullah Bariyalai, who briefly headed the 6th Army Corps before becoming deputy defence minister in 2002. The International Crisis Group describes this effort as 'coordinated and partially successful,' implemented by 'a commission composed of the deputies of the corps commander, division chiefs, police chiefs, and governors in all four northeastern provinces'.

Daoud was made deputy interior minister of narcotics affairs on August 16, 2004.

One report has the corps disbanding in 2003.

683,['wealth uneven to poverty shared a : China China in disparity Income ?'],"In China today, poverty refers mainly to the rural poor, decades of economic development has reduced urban extreme poverty. According to the World Bank, more than 850 million Chinese people have been lifted out of extreme poverty; China's poverty rate fell from 88 percent in 1981 to 0.7 percent in 2015, as measured by the percentage of people living on the equivalent of US$1.90 or less per day in 2011 purchasing price parity terms,which still stands in 2022.Chinese definition of extreme poverty is more stringent than that of World Bank, and is defined as earning less than $2.30 a day at purchasing power parity (PPP),Since the start of far-reaching economic reforms in the late 1970s, growth has fuelled a substantial increase in per-capita income lifting people out of extreme poverty. China's per capita income has increased fivefold between 1990 and 2000, from $200 to $1,000. Between 2000 and 2010, per capita income also rose by the same rate, from $1,000 to $5,000, moving China into the ranks of middle-income countries. Between 1990 and 2005, China's progress accounted for more than three-quarters of global poverty reduction and was largely responsible for the world reaching the UN millennium development target of dividing extreme poverty in half. This can be attributed to a combination of a rapidly expanding labour market, driven by a protracted period of economic growth, and a series of government transfers such as an urban subsidy, and the introduction of a rural pension. The World Bank Group said that the percentage of the population living below the international poverty line of $1.9 (2011 PPP) fell to 0.7 percent in 2015, and poverty line of $3.2 (2011 PPP) fell to 7% in 2015.At the end of 2018, the number of people living below China's national poverty line of ¥2,300 (CNY) per year (in 2010 constant prices) was 16.6 million, equal to 1.7% of the population at the time. 

On November 23, 2020, China announced that it had eliminated absolute poverty nationwide by uplifting all of its citizens beyond its set ¥2,300 per year (in 2010 constant prices), or around ¥4,000 per year in 2020. The World Bank has different poverty lines for countries with different gross national income (GNI). With an GNI per capita of $ 10,610 in 2020,China is an upper middle-income country. The poverty line for an upper middle-income country is $5.5 per day at PPP. As of 2020, China has succeeded in eradicating absolute poverty, but not the poverty defined for upper middle-income countries which China belongs to. China still has around 13% of its population falling below this poverty line of $5.50 per day in 2020. Chinese premier Li Keqiang said in May 2020 that 40% of Chinese people earn an average of ¥1,000 CNY (around $150) a month (measured at the exchange rate,  not at PPP).

Overview
Since Deng Xiaoping began instituting market reforms in the late 1970s, China has been among the most rapidly growing economies in the world, regularly exceeding 15 percent GDP growth annually. This growth has led to a substantial increase in real living standards and a marked decline in poverty. Between 1981 and 2008, the proportion of China's population living on less than $1.25/day is estimated to have fallen from 85% to 13.1%, meaning that roughly 600 million people were taken out of extreme poverty. At the same time, this rapid change has brought with it different kinds of stresses. China faces serious natural resource scarcity and environmental degradation. It has also seen growing disparities as people in different parts of the country and with different characteristics have benefited from the growth at different rates.

Starting from the pre-reform situation, some increase in income inequality was inevitable, as favored coastal urban locations benefited from the opening policy, and as the small stock of educated people found new opportunities. However, particular features of Chinese policy may have exacerbated rather than mitigated growing disparities. The household registration (hukou) system kept rural-urban migration below what it otherwise would have been, and contributed to the development of one of the largest rural-urban income divides in the world. Weak tenure over rural land also limited the ability of peasants to benefit from their primary asset.

Aside from income inequality, there has also been an increase in inequality of educational outcomes and health status, partly the result of China's uniquely decentralized fiscal system, in which local government has been primarily responsible for funding basic health and education. Poor localities have not been able to fund these services, and poor households have not been able to afford the high private cost of basic education and healthcare.

The large trade surplus that has emerged in China has exacerbated the inequalities, and makes them harder to address. The trade surplus stimulates the urban manufacturing sector, which is already relatively well off. It limits the government's scope to increase funding for public services such as rural health and education. The government has been trying to rebalance China's production away from investment and exports towards domestic consumption and services, to improve the country's long-term macroeconomic health and the situation of the relatively poor in China.

Recent government measures to reduce disparities include relaxation of the hukou system, abolition of the agricultural tax, and increased central transfers to fund health and education in rural areas.

Poverty reduction

China has maintained a high growth rate for more than 30 years since the beginning of economic reform in 1978, this sustained growth has generated a huge increase in average living standards. 25 years ago, China had many characteristics in common with the rest of developing Asia: large population, low per capita income, and resource scarcity on a per capita basis. But in the 15 years from 1990 to 2005, China averaged per capita growth of 8.7%

The whole reform program is often referred to in brief as the ""open door policy"". This highlights that a key component of Chinese reform has been trade liberalization and opening up to foreign direct investment, but not opening the capital account more generally to portfolio flows. China improved its human capital, opened up to foreign trade and investment, and created a better investment climate for the private sector.

After joining the WTO China's average tariffs have dropped below 100%, and to around 5% for manufactured imports. It initially welcomed foreign investment into ""special economic zones"". Some of these zones were very large, amounting to urban areas of 20 million people or more. The positive impact of foreign investment in these locations led to a more general opening up of the economy to foreign investment, with the result that China became the largest recipient of direct investment flows in the 1990s.

The opening up measures have been accompanied by improvements in the investment climate. Particularly in the coastal areas, cities have developed their investment climates. In these cities, the private sector accounts for 90% or more of manufacturing assets and production. In 2005, the average pretax rate of return for domestic private firms was the same as that for foreign-invested firms. Local governments in coastal cities have lowered loss of output due to unreliable power supply to 1.0% and customs clearance time for imports has been lowered in Chinese cities to 3.3 days.

China's sustained growth fueled historically unprecedented poverty reduction. The World Bank uses a poverty line based on household real consumption (including consumption of own-produced crops and other goods), set at $1 per day measured at Purchasing Power Parity. In most low-income countries this amount is sufficient to guarantee each person about 1000 calories of nutrition per day, plus other basic necessities. In 2007, this line corresponds to about 2,836 RMB per year. Based on household surveys, the poverty rate in China in 1981 was 63% of the population. This rate declined to 10% in 2004, indicating that about 500 million people have climbed out of poverty during this period.

This poverty reduction has occurred in waves. The shift to the household responsibility system propelled a large increase in agricultural output, and poverty was cut in half over the short period from 1981 to 1987. From 1987 to 1993 poverty reduction stagnated, then resumed again. From 1996 to 2001 there was once more relatively little poverty reduction. Since China joined the WTO in 2001, however, poverty reduction resumed at a very rapid rate, and poverty was cut by a third in just three years.

Taken from the Asian Development Bank, there was an estimated average annual growth rate of 0.5% in China between 2010 and 2015. This brought the Chinese population to 1.37 billion in 2015. As per China's national poverty line, 8.5 percent of people were in poverty in 2013, which decreased to 1.7 percent in 2018.

On 6 March 2020, Xi Jinping, the General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, announced that by 2020, China will achieve all poverty alleviation in rural areas. On 28 May 2020, Li Keqiang, the Premier of China, said that ""China has over 600 million people whose monthly income is barely 1,000 yuan (USD 140) and their lives have further been affected by the coronavirus pandemic.""

Universal Healthcare
Michelle Bachelet visited China in May 2022, the first time in 17 years that a UN high commissioner for human rights had travelled to China. In a statement about her visit she wrote ""The introduction of universal health care and almost universal unemployment insurance scheme go a long way in ensuring protection of the right to health and broader social and economic rights"".

Increased inequality
China's growth has been so rapid that virtually every household has benefited significantly, fueling the steep drop in poverty. However, different people have benefited to very different extents, so that inequality has risen during the reform period. This is true for inequality in household income or consumption, as well as for inequality in important social outcomes such as health status or educational attainment. Concerning household consumption, the Gini measure of inequality increased from 0.31 at the beginning of reform to 0.45 in 2004. To some extent this rise in inequality is the natural result of the market forces that have generated the strong growth; but to some extent it is ""artificial"" in the sense that various government policies exacerbate the tendencies toward higher inequality, rather than mitigate them. Changes to some policies could halt or even reverse the increasing inequality. (See List of countries by income equality.)

The Nobel Prize-winning economist Sir Arthur Lewis noted that ""development must be inegalitarian because it does not start in every part of the economy at the same time"" in 1954. China classically manifests two of the characteristics of development that Lewis had in mind: rising return to education and rural-urban migration. As an underdeveloped country, China began its reform with relatively few highly educated people, and with a small minority of the population (20%) living in cities, where labor productivity was about twice the level as in the countryside.

In pre-reform China there was very little return to education manifested in salaries. Cab drivers and college professors had similar incomes. Economic reform has created a labor market in which people can search for higher pay, and one result of this is that salaries for educated people have gone up dramatically. In the short period between 1988 and 2003, the wage returns to one additional year of schooling increased from 4% to 11%. This development initially leads to higher overall inequality, because the initial stock of educated people is small and they are concentrated at the high end of the income distribution. But if there is reasonably good access to education, then over time a greater and greater share of the population will become educated, and that will ultimately tend to reduce inequality.

The large productivity and wage gap between cities and countryside also drives a high rate of rural-urban migration, which has left millions of children traumatized due to parents who have left them to be raised by other family members, as the Chinese government does not allow parents who move to urban areas to take their children with them. Lewis pointed out that, starting from a situation of 80% rural, the initial shift of some from low-productivity agriculture to high productivity urban employment is disequalizing. If the flow continues until the population is more than 50% urban, however, further migration is equalizing. This pattern is very evident in the history of the U.S., with inequality rising during the rapid industrialization period from 1870 to 1920, and then declining thereafter. So, the same market forces that have produced the rapid growth in China predictably led to higher inequality. But it is important to note that in China there are a number of government policies that exacerbate this tendency toward higher inequality and restrict some of the potential mechanisms that would normally lead to an eventual decline in inequality.

Rural-urban divide

Much of the increase in inequality in China can be attributed to the widening rural-urban divide, particularly the differentials in rural-urban income. A household survey conducted in 1995 showed that the rural-urban income gap accounted for 35% of the overall inequality in China.

In 2009, according to the China's National Bureau of Statistics, the urban per capita annual income at US$2,525 was approximately three times that of the rural per capita annual income. This was the widest income gap recorded in China since 1978. Urban-based economic policies adopted by the government contribute to the income disparities. This is also known as the ‘artificial’ result of the rural-urban divide. In terms of the share of investments allotted by the state, urban areas were given a larger proportion when compared with rural areas. In the period 1986–1992, investments to urban state-owned enterprises (SOE) accounted for more than 25% of the total government budget. On the other hand, less than 10% of the government budget was allocated to investments in the rural economy in the same period by the state despite the fact that about 73-76% of the total population lived in the rural areas. However, the burden of the inflation caused by the fiscal expansion, which at that time was at a level of approximately 8.5%, was shared by all including the rural population. Such biased allocation of government finances to the urban sector meant that the wages earned by urban workers also include these government fiscal transfers. This is in addition to the relatively higher proportions of credit loans the government also provided to the urban SOEs in the same period. Meanwhile, the wages earned by the rural workers came mainly from growth in output only. These urban-biased policies reflect the importance of the urban minority to the government relative to the rural majority.

In the period when reforms in urban areas were introduced, the real wages earned by urban workers rose inexorably. Restrictions to rural-urban migration protected the urban workers from competition from the rural workers, which therefore also contributed to rural-urban disparities. According to a report by the World Bank published in 2009, 99% of the poor in China come from rural areas if migrant workers in cities are included in the rural population figures. Excluding migrant workers from the rural population figures indicates that 90% of poverty in China is still rural.

Inequality in China does not only occur between rural and urban areas. There exist inequalities within rural areas, and within urban areas themselves. In some rural areas, incomes are comparable to that of urban incomes, while in others, income remains low as development is limited. Rural-urban inequalities do not only refer to income differentials but also include inequalities in areas such as education and health care.

Urban poverty in China
The structural reforms of China's economy have brought about a widening of the income gap and rising unemployment in cities. The increasing challenge for the Chinese government and social organizations is to address and solve poverty issues in urban areas where people are increasingly being economically and socially marginalized. According to the official estimates, 12 million people were considered as urban poor in 1993, i.e. 3.6 per cent of the total urban population, but by 2006 the figure had jumped to more than 22 million, i.e. 4.1 per cent of the total urban population and these figures are estimated to grow if the government fails to institute any effective measures to circumvent this escalating problem.

China's “floating population” has since helped spur rapid development in the country because of the cheap and plentiful labor they can offer. On the flip side, many people who came from the rural areas are not able to find jobs in the cities. This surplus of rural laborers and mass internal migration will no doubt pose a major threat to the country's political stability and economic growth. Their inabilities to find jobs compounded by the rising costs of living in the cities have made many people fall below the poverty line.

There are also large numbers of unemployed and laid-off workers from state-owned enterprises (SOEs). These enterprises have since failed to compete efficiently with the private and foreign-funded companies when China's open-door policy was introduced. In the years 1995 to 2000, the state sector lost 31 million jobs, which amounted to 28 per cent of the jobs in the sector. The non-state sector has been creating new jobs but not in sufficient numbers to offset job losses from the state sector.

SOEs’ roles were more than employers, they are also responsible for the provision of welfare benefits, like retirement pensions, incentives for medical care, housing and direct subsidies and the like to its employees, as these burdens greatly increased production costs. In 1992, SOE expenses on insurance and welfare took up 35% of the total wages. Therefore, many people not only lost their jobs but also the social benefits and security that they were once so reliant on. The adverse consequences arising from the market reforms are evidently seen as a socially destabilizing factor.

Lastly, the government provided little or no social benefit for the urban poor who needed the most attention. Ministry of Labor and Social Security (MLSS) was the last line of defense against urban poverty in the provision of social insurance and the living allowance for laid-off employees. However, its effectiveness was limited in scope in which less than a quarter of the eligible urban poor actually receiving assistance.

The Minimum Living Standard Scheme was first implemented in Shanghai in 1993 to help supplement the income of the urban poor. It is a last resort program that is meant to help those that don't qualify for other forms of government aid. The Minimum Living Standard Scheme set regional poverty lines and gave recipients a sum of money. The amount of money received by each recipient was the difference in their income and the poverty line. The Scheme has grown rapidly and has since been adopted by over 580 cities and 1120 counties.

Rural Poverty 
While poverty has been reduced immensely in China over the past decade, it still remains a large problem in rural China. Rural China has historically been disproportionately taxed and also have received fewer benefits from the recent economic development and success of China. Agriculture has been the main occupation for the inhabitants of rural China, and in villages the produce generated is used to feed the village and not for selling on the market. Even in the heartlands of China where agriculture is used for commercial purposes, the economic boom of China has actually led to a decrease in the price of produce which has resulted in a loss of income for these producers.

Children growing up in poverty are more likely to be undernourished, have less educational opportunities, and have lower literacy levels. And those whose parents move to urban areas in an effort to give these children a better life—and are not allowed by the Chinese government to take their children with them—are unintentionally traumatizing and damaging these children. Studies show approximately 70% of the 'left-behind' kids—they are sometimes called the 'lost generation', or the 'damaged generation', suffer from emotional trauma, depression or anxiety. About a third of the left-behind children—20 million—will get involved in crime, while another third will need time in mental health institutions.

The disproportionate amount of inequality in China's rural sector along with correlation between poverty and education shows that children born in rural China are much more likely to score lower on literacy tests and not have the opportunity to pursue higher education.

The implementation of Chinese policy has exacerbated the issue of rural poverty en lieu of increased urban poverty. Typically the urbanization of a country leads to mass migration from the rural areas to the urban. However, the Chinese government implemented a policy that restricts the migration of people born in rural China from coming to urban China. This restriction is based on the citizen's registration under the hukou system, which states if the individual was born in an agricultural (rural) or non-agricultural (urban) area. Additionally, Chinese officials have been cracking down on Chinese migrants from rural communities that have moved to Beijing. In 2017, thousands of migrant workers living in Beijing were evicted because they did not possess an urban hukou. This process of removing migrants from rural to urban China, relocates them back to rural China where they no longer have a job or source of income. This is a relocation of poverty from the urban sector to the rural sector.

The political response of China's government to the issue of rural poverty has been both lauded and criticized. China has been criticized for its high rate of rural poverty and the policies that the government has put in place to ameliorate the poverty. In Transformation of Rural China, Jonathan Unger points out that the lack of taxation at the village level restricts the villages from dealing with the problems they face. This means problems such as food instability and lack of education are not able to be addressed by local officials. Supporters of government policy point out that over the time period of 1978 to 2014, China has reduced rural poverty from 250 million people to just over 70 million people. China's Rural Poverty Alleviation and Development Outline from 2001 to 2010 led to certain government policy directly dealing with the issue of poverty with the removal of agriculture tax in 2006 and a program which the government paid rural families to plant trees on degraded land. More fundamental and radical measures such as directly redistributive taxation and social security systems or land tenure and agricultural produce price reforms are not mentioned here, however: presumably because they are not considered prudent.

Unequal educational opportunity

Education is a prerequisite for the development of human capital which in turn is an important factor in a country's overall development. Apart from the increasing income inequality, the education sector has long suffered from problems such as funding shortages and unequal allocation of education resources, adding to the disparity between China's urban and rural life; this was exacerbated by the two track system of government's approach to education. The first track is government -supported primary education in urban areas and the second is family -supported primary education in the rural areas.

Rural education has been marginalized by the focus on immediate economic development and the fact that urban education enjoys more attention and investment by the central government. This lack of public funding meant that children of rural families were forced to drop out of school, thus losing the opportunity to further their studies and following the paths of their parents to become low skilled workers with few chances of advancements. This leads to a vicious cycle of poverty. Because of limited educational resources, urban schools were supported by the government while village schools were provided for by the local communities where educational opportunities were possibly constrained depending on local conditions. Thus, there still exist a huge gap in teacher preparation and quality of facilities between rural and urban areas.

The two track system was then abolished in 1986 & 1992, to be replaced by the Compulsory Education Law and the Rule for the Implementation of the Compulsory Education Law respectively. Despite the emphasis of China's education reform on providing quality and holistic education, the rural schools still lack the capacity to implement such reforms vis-à-vis their urban counterparts. The rural areas lack the educational resources of the urban areas and the rural areas are considered to be falling below the educational benchmark set in the cities. Teachers are more attracted to urban sectors with higher pay and a slew of benefits. In addition, rural villages have a difficult time finding quality teachers because of the lower standard of living in villages. As a result, some rural teachers are not qualified as they received college degrees from continuing-education programs, which is not the best type of further education one could receive.

As a result, rural students often find themselves neither competitive enough to gain admissions to colleges nor employable for most occupations. Rural residents are increasingly being marginalised in higher education, closing off their best opportunities for advancement. This is especially prominent in Tsinghua and Peking University where the percentage of rural population studying in the two universities have shrunk to 17.6 percent in 2000 and 16.3 percent in 1999, down from 50 to 60 percent in the 1950s. These numbers are the most recent reliable data that has been published and experts agree that the number might be as low as 1 percent in 2010.

Restrictions on migration

Pre-reform China had a system that severely restricted people's mobility, and that system has only slowly been reformed over the past 25 years. Each person has a registration (hukou) in either a rural area or an urban area, and cannot change the hukou without the permission of the receiving jurisdiction. In practice cities usually give registration to skilled people who have offers of employment, but have generally been reluctant to provide registration to migrants from the countryside. Nevertheless, these migrants are needed for economic development, and large numbers have in fact migrated. Many of these fall into the category of ""floating population"". There are nearly 200 million rural residents who spend at least six months of the year working in urban areas. Many of these people have for all practical purposes moved to a city, but they do not have official registration. Beyond the floating population, there are tens of millions of people who have left rural areas and obtained urban hukous.

So, there is significant rural-urban migration in China, but it seems likely that the hukou system has resulted in less migration than otherwise would have occurred. There are several pieces of evidence to support this view. First, the gap in per capita income between rural and urban areas widened during the reform period, reaching a ratio of three to one. Three to one is a very high gap by international standards. Second, manufacturing wages have risen sharply in recent years, at double-digit rates, so that China now has considerably higher wages than much of the rest of developing Asia (India, Vietnam, Pakistan, Bangladesh). This rise is good for the incumbent workers, but they are relatively high up in China's income distribution, so that the wage increases raise inequality. It is hard to imagine that manufacturing wages would have risen so rapidly if there had not been such controls on labor migration. Third, recent studies focusing on migrants have shown that it is difficult for them to bring their families to the city, put their children in school, and obtain healthcare. So, the growth of the urban population must have been slowed down by these restrictions.

China's urbanization so far has been a relatively orderly process. One does not see in China the kinds of slums and extreme poverty that exist in cities throughout South Asia, Latin America, and Africa. Nevertheless, urbanization goes on: the urban share of China's population has risen from 20% to 40% during the course of economic reform. But at the same time the hukou system has slowed and distorted urbanization, without preventing it. The system has likely contributed to inequality by limiting the opportunities of the relatively poor rural population to move to better-paying employment.

Land policy

Just as Chinese citizens are either registered as urban or rural under the Hukou system, land in China is zoned as either rural or urban. Under Chinese property law, there is no privately held land. Urban land is owned by the state, which grants land rights for a set number of years. Reforms in the late 1980s and 1990s allowed for transactions in urban land, enabling citizens to sell their land and buildings, or mortgage them to borrow, while still retaining state ownership. Rural, or “collectively owned land”, is leased by the state for periods of 30 years, and is theoretically reserved for agricultural purposes, housing and services for farmers. Peasants have long-term tenure as long as they sow the land, but they cannot mortgage or sell the use rights. The biggest distortion, however, concerns moving land from rural to urban use. China is a densely populated, water-scarce country whose comparative advantage lies more in manufacturing and services than in agriculture. The fact that many peasants cannot earn a decent living as farmers is a signal that their labor is more useful in urban employment, hence the hundreds of millions of people who have migrated. But, at the same time, it is efficient to allocate some of the land out of agriculture for urban use.

In China, that conversion is handled administratively, requiring central approval. Farmers are compensated based on the agricultural value of the land. But the reason to convert land – especially in the fringes around cities – is that the commercial value of the land for urban use is higher than its value for agriculture. So, even if China's laws on land are followed scrupulously, the conversion does not generate a high income for the peasants. There are cases in which the conversion is done transparently, the use of rights over the land auctioned, and the revenue collected put into the public budget to finance public goods. But still the peasants get relatively poor recompense. One government study found that 62% of displaced peasants were worse off after land conversion.

Secure land tenure is recognized as a powerful tool to reduce poverty, and the central government has begun guaranteeing all farmers 30-year land rights, strictly limiting expropriations, documenting and publicizing farmers’ rights, and requiring sufficient compensation when farmers’ lands are expropriated. A 2010 survey of 17 provinces by Landesa found improved documentation of farmer's land rights, but much room for improvement: 63% of farming families have been issued land-rights certificates and 53% have land-rights contracts, but only 44% have been issued both documents (as is required by law) and 29% have no document at all; farmers who have been issued these documents are far more likely to make long-term investments in their land and are financially benefiting from those investments.

Fiscal system and rural social services

Market reform has dramatically increased the return to education, as it indicates that there are good opportunities for skilled people and as it creates a powerful incentive for families to increase the education of their children. However, there needs to be strong public support for education and reasonably fair access to the education system. Otherwise, inequality can become self-perpetuating: if only high-income people can educate their children, then that group remains a privileged, high-income group permanently. China is at some risk of falling into this trap, because it has developed a highly decentralized fiscal system in which local governments rely primarily on local tax collection to provide basic services such as primary education and primary health care. China in fact has one of the most decentralized fiscal systems in the world.

China is much more decentralized than OECD countries and middle-income countries, particularly on the spending side. More than half of all expenditure takes place at the sub-provincial level. In part, the sheer size of the country explains this degree of decentralization, but the structure of government and some unusual expenditure assignments also give rise to this pattern of spending. Functions such as social security, justice, and even the production of national statistics are largely decentralized in China, whereas they are central functions in most other countries.

Fiscal disparities among subnational governments are larger in China than in most OECD countries. These disparities have emerged alongside a growing disparity in economic strength among the provinces. From 1990 to 2003, the ratio of per capita GDP of the richest to poorest province grew from 7.3 to 13. In China, the richest province has more than 8 times the per capita public spending than the poorest province. In the US, the poorest state has about 65 percent of the revenues of the average state, and in Germany, any state falling below 95 percent of the average level gets subsidized through the ""Finanzausgleich"" (and any receiving more than 110 percent gets taxed). In Brazil, the richest state has 2.3 times the revenues per capita of the poorest state.

Inequalities in spending are even larger at the sub-provincial level. The richest county, the level that is most important for service delivery, has about 48 times the level of per capita spending of the poorest county. These disparities in aggregate spending levels also show up in functional categories such as health and education where variation among counties and among provinces is large.

These differences in public spending translate into differences in social outcomes. Up through 1990, there were only modest differences across provinces in infant survival rate, but by 2000 there had emerged a very sharp difference, closely related to the province's per capita GDP. So too with the high-school enrollment rate: there used to be small differences across provinces. By 2003, high-school enrollment was nearing 100% in the wealthier provinces while still less than 40% in poor provinces.

There is some redistribution within China's fiscal system, but arguments abound whether it is enough. Poor areas have very little tax collection and hence cannot fund education and health care. Some of their population will relocate over time. But for reasons of both national efficiency and opportunity, some theoretical economists argue for the communist state to ensure everyone has some basic education and basic health care.

China's highly decentralized fiscal system results in: local government in many locations not having adequate resources to fund basic social services. As a consequence, households are left to pay for their own needs to a remarkable extent. The average hospital visit in China in 2018 is paid 35% out-of-pocket by the patient, compared to 25% in Mexico, 17% in Australia, 10% in Turkey and the United States, and lower amounts in most developed countries. Poor households either forego treatment, or travel to other cities for treatment, which can be expensive if the condition is severe. In the 2003 National Health Survey, 30% of poor households identified a large health care expenditure as the reason that they were having financial difficulties.

The situation in education is similar. In a survey of 3037 villages in 2004, average primary school fees were 260 yuan and average middle-school fees, 442 yuan. A family living right at the dollar-a-day poverty line would have about 900 yuan total resources for a child for a year; sending a child to middle-school would take half of that. Not surprisingly, then, enrollment rates are relatively low in poor areas and for poor families.

Women In Poverty

In China, women are more vulnerable to suffer from severe poverty than men. More women experience multidimensional poverty (38.9% compared to 25.2%). Many individual and social characteristics shape women's experiences on poverty, such as age, education, employment, family structure, family size, urban or rural areas, etc.

Article body 
In terms of individual factors, women are less likely complete their primary education, have worse health and nutrition, and more likely to enduring chronic diseases, hospitalization and low income. As daughter, women's education is less valued by their parents. As mothers, women are expected to value their children's care work more than their own career. In addition, the gender inequalities in the labor market is pervasive. The labor force participation rate of women has declined since the economic reforms and financial hardship was severe among women. In terms of marital factors, research shows that single mothers are the suffer the most from poverty. On the one hand, social and public policies are usually inadequate for single-parent families, especially families headed by women. On the other hand, Chinese traditional belief on family see divorce as negative, and often push mothers to sacrifice themselves to fulfill their children. Age is also a factor that contribute to women's poverty. Research shows that women are in lower chance to receive less occupational pension and receive less benefit (women receive 595 yuan per month whereas men receive 1,105 yuan). Also, women in their 50s are more likely to take the responsibility of caring their elderly parents and grandchildren, therefore more likely to retire earlier and receive less money in pension.

In terms of regional factors, women who live in remote and less developed western region are more likely to live in poverty than eastern area. For example, women live in Guizhou and Gansu provinces have the highest multidimensional poverty rate. Many women in poverty immigrant from their hometown to another province for improving their living situation, and many use marriage as the approach. (Research shows much more women migrated from relatively less developed regions to more developed regions through marriage than men). Some women did get out of absolute poverty through marriage, however, because of limited opportunities, they are likely to fall into relative poverty soon after relocation. Also, migrant wives often suffer from perpetuated poverty after marriage.

In the state level, it is hard to find official data on women in poverty and poverty reduction programs tend to focus more on men, which widen the gender inequality. A research focus on a poverty reduction program in the Inner Mongolia shows that women's empowerment program can make positive effects on poverty reduction. It suggest that if poverty program can be more gender-focus, women and their household in poverty can benefit more from intervention such as training, cooperatives, and credit.

942,"['what prove reasoning proper a with who , men wise but , fools not are they and , revelation a deny who some are there but , doubts only not are there and known not is imperative an Such ?']","Kazimierz Łyszczyński (; 4 March 1634  – 30 March 1689), also known in English as Casimir Liszinski, was a Polish nobleman, philosopher, and soldier in the ranks of the Sapieha family, who was accused, tried, and executed for atheism in 1689.

For eight years he studied philosophy as a Jesuit and then became a podsędek (supply judge) in legal cases against the Jesuits concerning estates. He wrote a treatise entitled On the non-existence of God and was later executed on charges of atheism. His trial has been criticised and is seen as a case of legalised religious murder in Poland.

Life

Education and work 

Kazimierz Łyszczyński was born in Łyszczyce, in what is now Brest District, Brest Region, Belarus. He became a nobleman, landowner, philosopher, and soldier in the service of the Sapieha family. For eight years he studied philosophy as a Jesuit, but left the order and then became a supply judge (podsędek) in legal cases against the Jesuits concerning estates. He was also member of the Sejm of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

Łyszczyński had read a book by Henry Aldsted entitled Theologia Naturalis, which attempted to prove the existence of divinity. But its arguments were so confused that Łyszczyński was able to infer many contradictions. Ridiculing Aldsted, Łyszczyński wrote in the book's margins the words ""ergo non-est Deus"" (""therefore God does not exist"").

This was discovered by one of Łyszczyński's debtors, Jan Kazimierz Brzoska, who was the nuncio of Brest in Poland or a Stolnik of Bracławice or Łowczy of Brześć. Brzoska, reluctant to return a great sum of money lent him by Łyszczyński, accused the latter of being an atheist and gave the aforementioned work as evidence to Witwicki, bishop of Poznań. Brzoska also stole and delivered to the court a handwritten copy of De non-existentia Dei, which was the first Polish philosophical treatise presenting reality from an atheistic perspective, and which Łyszczyński had been working on since 1674.

Trial 
Witwicki along with Załuski, bishop of Kiev, took up this case with zeal. King John III Sobieski attempted to help Łyszczyński by ordering that he should be judged at Vilnius, but this could not save Łyszczyński from the clergy. Łyszczyński's first privilege as a Polish noble, that he could not be imprisoned before his condemnation, was violated. The Łyszczyński case was brought before the diet of 1689 where he was accused of having denied the existence of God and having blasphemed against the Virgin Mary and the saints. He was condemned to death for atheism.

Execution 

The sentence was carried out before noon in the Old Town Market Place in Warsaw, where his tongue was pulled out followed by a beheading. After that, his corpse was transported beyond the city borders and cremated.

Bishop Załuski gave the following account of the execution:

De non-existentia Dei
Łyszczyński wrote a treatise, De non-existentia Dei (On the non-existence of God), stating that God does not exist and that religions are inventions of man.

On the basis of a public denunciation, a trial was conducted before a Sejm commission. There is an actual transcript of the proceedings at the Kórnik library, including a speech by the Grand Duchy of Lithuania Instigator Regni Szymon Kurowicz Zabistowski, citing fragments of De non-existentia Dei. The treatise itself was destroyed by the Sejm, but the surviving cited fragments are as follows:

I – we beseech you, o' theologians, by your God, if in this manner do you not extinguish the light of Reason, do you not oust the sun from this world, do you not pull down your God from the sky, when attributing to him the impossible, whereof the characteristics and attributes contradict themselves.

II – Man is the creator of God, and God is a concept and creation of Man. Hence people are the architects and engineers of God, and God is not a true being but a being existing only within the mind; being chimeric by its nature, because a God and a chimera are the same thing.

III – Religion was constituted by people without religion, so they could be worshipped although the God is not existent. Piety was introduced by the unpietic. The fear of God was spread by the unafraid so that the people were afraid of them in the end. Devotion named godly is a design of Man. Doctrine, be it logical or philosophical, bragging to be teaching the truth of God, is false, and on the contrary, the one condemned as false, is the very true one.

IV – simple folk are cheated by the more cunning with the fabrication of God for their own oppression; whereas the same oppression is shielded by the folk in a way, that if the wise attempted to free them by the truth, they would be quelled by the very people.

V – nevertheless we do not experience within us and within any other such an imperative of reason, which would ensure us of a truth of divine revelation. Alas if they were present in us, then everyone would have to acknowledge them and would have no doubts and would not contradict the Writings of Moses and the Gospels – which is not true – and there would be no different congregations and their followers as Mahomet etc. Such an imperative is not known and there are not only doubts, but there are some who deny a revelation, and they are not fools, but wise men, who with a proper reasoning prove what? the very contrary, what I also prove here. Concluding, that God does not exist"".During his trial, Łyszczyński claimed that the work was to be about a Catholic and an atheist having a debate, in which the Catholic would eventually win (he told the diet that the work would have had a different title from De non-existentia Dei). The atheist was to speak first followed by the Catholic. He claimed that he only wrote the first half of the work (that is only the atheist's argument) and then stopped writing at the advice of a priest.

Status in modern Poland
Regardless of whether Łyszczyński was genuinely an atheist, in communist Poland he came to be celebrated as a martyr to the atheist cause. In a series of papers, the philosopher Andrzej Nowicki presented a romanticized view of Łyszczyński, stating that ""in terms of breadth of intellectual horizons, thoroughness of philosophical erudition, and boldness of thought, he was beyond doubt the most eminent Polish mind of the age.""

According to Pomian, ""It appears that Łyszczyński was sentenced to death for writing a treatise entitled 'De non-existentia Dei' ... and all that remains are a few notes which were made during the trial. Apart from this and also the fact that his execution caused some controversy at the time on account of his being a member of the gentry, next to nothing is known about Łyszczyński. Łyszczyński's importance as a martyr of the atheist cause has led to his romanticization by Nowicki and to his rescue from a murky cell in the obscure by-ways of history. A copious amount of writing has appeared concerning both what is not known about him and what the content of his thought might have been. Nowicki writes boldly: 'Polish intellectual life cannot boast of any one figure who could compare with Łyszczyński in terms of breadth of intellectual horizons, the thoroughness of philosophical erudition and the boldness of thought. He was beyond doubt the most eminent Polish mind of the epoch.' What a pity that no one knows what the content of his thought was. According to the notes made at the trial, Łyszczyński, was curiously 'modern', even to the point of incongruity, in his critique of religion: all of his remarks might have been made by Marx or Lenin ... Łyszczyński clearly states his disbelief in God. The incongruity of this idea, however, lies in an inability to understand its genesis in the context of Polish society at that time ...  there is no independent or clear evidence of other individuals with similar inclinations during Łyszczyński's time. To say that Łyszczyński was simply ahead of his time means nothing: it is an admission of the unavailability of an explanation.""

In March 2014, his persona and ideas were the key theme in a public performance during the 2014 Procession of Atheists in Poland, during which his execution was reenacted.

The event, started in 1989, is a three-day meeting of philosophers, historians, anthropologists, scientists, artists and actors where philosophical questions are debated; it is held at the Palais des congrès et de la culture of Le Mans, and focusses on a different question every year (previous instalments have centred on such question as ""why laugh?"", ""Who are animals?"", ""love always?""). This forum, which is broadcast on France Culture, is also the subject of a special issue of Monde des livres and of proceedings in the Folio collection of Gallimard.

Birnbaum had authored several essays, notably two on political inheritance among generations: Leur jeunesse et la nôtre : l’espérance révolutionnaire au fil des générations (""Their youth and ours: revolutionary hope among generations"") and Les Maoccidents : un néoconservatisme à la française (""The Maoccidents: a French neoconservatism""). He furthermore published the last interview of  Jacques Derrida, Apprendre à vivre enfin (translated into English as ""Learning to Live Finally"") in 2005.

In 2016, Birnbaum published Un silence religieux ; La gauche face au djihadisme (""A religious silence : the Left facing jihadism"") where he supported the notion that Left-wing frames of interpretation have so far lost contact with religion that it hinders understanding of jihadism, notably that of the Islamic State. The Left would accordingly refuse to recognise a religious nature to jihadism and insist on explaining its use of terrorism by ""social misery"".».

1045,"['Back Ya Got Who . 10 ?', ""Deal The 's What ?""]","Deadly Venoms is an American Wu-Tang Clan-affiliated all-female hip hop group formed in 1997 consisting of N-Tyce, J-Boo, Champ MC, and Finesse.  X Clan-affiliated rapper Lin Que was initially intended to be part of the group but departed soon after its inception due to business decisions. Each member of the group were experienced rappers prior to joining the collective. Finesse recorded an album with rapper Synquis named Soul Sisters in 1988, Champ released her debut album Ghetto Flava on East West America/Atlantic Records, and N-Tyce was signed to Wild Pitch/EMI in the mid 1990s and released a few singles including the RZA-produced ""Hush Hush Tip"" featuring Method Man. The Deadly Venoms was J-Boo's professional introduction.

A legal dispute with A&M/PolyGram Records and the then-forthcoming merger between the MCA and PolyGram families of labels that formed the Universal Music Group forced its debut album, Antidote, to remain in its vaults, although the single “One More to Go”  (featuring Inspectah Deck, Method Man, Cappadonna, Street Life, and GZA) b/w “Bomb Threat,” was released and the album was later leaked. Despite not being properly released, the album got positive reviews. The group was also featured on NBA All-Star and rapper Shaquille O'Neal's 1998 album Respect. Deadly Venoms' second album, Pretty Thugs, was also never properly released because of similar label disputes, this time with DreamWorks/Interscope/Universal Records.  However, as with Antidote, copies of the record were leaked, and a promo CD was pressed.

After the departure of Finesse due to undisclosed business reasons, the group finally managed to release an album with 2002's Still Standing, on Rocks the World/Caroline/Virgin/EMI Records.

1266,"[""Line My 's What shows panel BBC UK popular the on panellist a was Laski ?""]","Marghanita Laski (24 October 1915 – 6 February 1988) was an English journalist, radio panellist and novelist. She also wrote literary biography, plays and short stories, and contributed about 250,000 additions to the Oxford English Dictionary.

Personal life
Marghanita Laski was born in Manchester, England, to a prominent family of Jewish intellectuals (Neville Laski was her father, Moses Gaster her grandfather, and Harold Laski her uncle). She was educated at Lady Barn House School in Manchester and St Paul's Girls' School in Hammersmith, worked in fashion, then studied English at Somerville College, Oxford, where she was a close friend of Inez Pearn, who was later to become a novelist and marry Stephen Spender and subsequently, after a divorce, Charles Madge.

While at Oxford, she met John Eldred Howard, founder of the Cresset Press; they married in 1937. During this time, she worked as a journalist.

Laski lived at Capo Di Monte in Judge's Walk, Hampstead, North London, and in the Hertfordshire village of Abbots Langley.

Career
After her son and daughter were born, Laski began writing in earnest. Most of her output in the 1940s and 1950s was fiction. She wrote the original screenplay of the 1952 UK film It Started in Paradise and sold the film rights to a novel to John Mills: Little Boy Lost (1949), about an Englishman in search of a lost son in the ruins of post-war France. However, when the film adaptation was released in 1953, she was upset that it had been turned into a musical starring Bing Crosby. She turned towards non-fiction in the 1960s and 1970s, producing works on Charlotte Mary Yonge, Jane Austen, George Eliot and Rudyard Kipling.

An omnivorous reader, from 1958 she became a prolific and compulsive contributor to the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) and by 1986 had contributed about 250,000 quotations, making her (according to Ilan Stavans) ""the supreme contributor, male or female, to the OED"".

In the 1960s, Laski was science fiction critic for The Observer. On 1 October 1970, The Times published Laski's controversial article about bestselling historical novelist, Georgette Heyer. Entitled ""The Appeal of Georgette Heyer"" it raised a storm of protest with multiple letters sent to the newspaper decrying Laski's criticism of Heyer. Laski was a member of the Annan Committee on broadcasting between 1974 and 1977. She joined the Arts Council in 1979, was elected its Vice Chair in 1982, and served as the Chair of the Literature Panel from 1980 to 1984.

Broadcasting
Laski was a panellist on the popular UK BBC panel shows What's My Line? (1951–63), The Brains Trust (late 1950s), and Any Questions? (1960s).

Overall views
An avowed atheist, Laski was also a keen supporter of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. Her play, The Offshore Island, is about nuclear warfare.

Critical reception
Anthony Boucher described her novella The Victorian Chaise Longue as ""an admirably written book, highly skilled in its economic evocation of time, place and character – and a relentlessly terrifying one."" Ecstasy: A Study of Some Secular and Religious Experiences has been compared to The Varieties of Religious Experience by William James in its importance. Tory Heaven, a counterfactual novel depicting a Britain ruled by a rigidly hierarchical Conservative dictatorship and satirising middle-class attitudes towards the Attlee ministry, was described as ""wickedly amusing"" by Ralph Straus of The Sunday Times, and as ""an ingeniously contrived and wittily told tale"" by Hugh Fausset of the Manchester Guardian: writing about the book in 2018, David Kynaston called it a ""highly engaging, beautifully written novel"".

Death
Laski died at Royal Brompton Hospital, London, due to a smoking-related lung problem, on 6 February 1988, aged 72. She was survived by her husband and children.

1397,"['? ? ? ? ? ? ? Conjunction ?', 'SPECTACLE SCULPTURAL LIVE to INVITATION Fashion on View Shaded A "" Joode de Rachel and Huanca Donna by ?', 'CONJUNCTION ?']","Rachel de Joode (born 1979) is a Berlin-based sculptor, photographer, and installation artist.

Early life and education

Rachel de Joode studied art at the Academy of Art and Design St. Joost in Breda and time-based arts at the Gerrit Rietveld Academie in Amsterdam.

Work
After graduating, de Joode began working with photographs and short films that eventually evolved into sculptures that blurred the line between digital representation and an object. De Joode's work can be seen as a version of ephemeral reality, a surface or texture that can be seen as tactile but not felt because what appear to be sculptural materials are photographs. When she chooses to combine these photographs with actual materials, the illusion is magnified and a new form of naturalness is created as product of the artificial and the physical.

Images of de Joode's collaboration with Donna Huanca began circulating on internet in 2010. Conjunction was an interpretation of an astrological event that involved two performers moving through an installation as if practicing some forgotten ritual. De Joode's interest in the relationship between photography, physical reality and illusion appear in the documentation of the installation/performance. De Joode said that the internet influenced her in the way she perceives and processes visual images. For her, the photograph becomes a tool for the mediation of physical experience with matter. In effect, the networked documentation of an image becomes the artwork.

In her 2016 exhibition at Galerie Christophe Gaillard in Paris, de Joode explored the relationship between, photography, internet and her sculptural objects. A self-taught sculptor, de Joode had started working in three dimensions by making still lifes, photographing and arranging objects and thinking about the semiotics of objects. At a certain point de Joode stopped photographing her ""things"" (a manner she chooses to identify her work to avoid categorization) and started thinking of the art gallery as a stage that was meant to be photographed, documented and distributed through internet.

In the exhibition Instead of Pieces, a Play, (Galerie
Christophe Gaillard, Paris, 2018), de Joode, now as an artist protagonist sets up a stage in the middle of the gallery with actors dressed as artists presenting the exhibits. On the double walls hang small ceramic nude figurines representing the artist while anonymous arms pierce the walls to hold sculptural objects. The whole combines literal performance with virtual and real textures and photographic assemblages.

De Joode's Museum exhibitions include Myths of the Marble (2017) at Institute of Contemporary Art, Philadelphia (ICA) and Henie Onstad Kunstsenter, Oslo, Rachel de Joode, Flat Nature / Surface Bodies (2017) Fort Vijfhuizen, Amsterdam, Gestures of Tomorrow (2016) at Kunstverein Nürnberg and Metabolism (2015) at  Museo d’Arte Contemporanea, Rome

1433,"['managers senior of intelligence emotional improve meditation Does "" , him by coauthored paper a , recently More ?']","Amar Dev Amar (A.D. Amar) is an Indian-American scholar, researcher, and educator of knowledge in organizations. He has been fiercely working to enhance the application of knowledge and knowledge analytics in management. His contributions and initiatives in enhancing knowledge work research through traditional and non-conventional means, especially involving the mind and meditation techniques from the ancient writings have been carried out in professional societies such as (AOM) (the Academy of Management), IFORS (International Federation of Operational Research Societies) and EURO (the Association of European Operational Research Societies). Amar has lectured around the world promoting techniques to manage knowledge organizations and has authored over 100 publications in journals and periodicals such as Organizational Dynamics, Harvard Business Review, IIE Transactions, and European Journal of Innovation Management. Amar is a professor of management at the W. Paul Stillman School of Business at Seton Hall University.

Academic career 
Amar studied science and engineering at the Punjab Engineering College of the Panjab University in India, continued at Montana State University and then moved on to The Graduate Center, City University of New York for doctoral studies in business and management, earning a Ph.D. degree in 1980. In 1983, he joined the faculty of the Stillman School at Seton Hall University where he has trained students in strategy, operations, knowledge organization, and management. In addition to Seton Hall, Amar has served on the faculties of the Punjab Engineering College, Westminster Business School, London, Touro College-Moscow, and Warsaw School of Economics, Warsaw. In addition to teaching and writing for journals and editing The Mid-Atlantic Journal of Business for twelve years, he published the book Managing Knowledge Workers.

In 2010, Amar earned the NJBIA Bright Idea Award in Management by the NJPRO Foundation of New Jersey Business and Industry Association for his publication, ""To be a better leader, give up authority"". More recently, a paper coauthored by him, ""Does meditation improve emotional intelligence of senior managers? Findings from a study in London"",  was the recipient of the 2013 Carolyn Dexter Finalist Award of the Academy of Management and the 2014 Academy of Management Best Paper Award. At the 2019 Academy of Management Annual Conference, Amar organized a symposium which won the ""MSR Best Symposium Proposal"" award. He has served on nine management Ph.D. committees as an external examiner.

In addition to his academic career, Amar has been involved in civic activism. He has served and currently serves on several editorial and public boards. In 2008, he was a candidate for the Republican Primary from the New Jersey's 7th Congressional District U.S. House of Representative seat.

In the 2016 Presidential Campaign, Amar served as the founding president of the ""Indian-Americans for Trump 2016"" PAC. Amar was one of the three notable university personalities to endorse Donald Trump before the start of the GOP primary saying, ""I've been observing his style and management for many years..., there is a kind of unpredictability and a kind of drama. In his actual management and his execution, there is no drama, and there is no unpredictability"". As a result of his longtime commitment to Indian-American participation in politics, he was awarded Professor of the Year by the Indian American Republican Committee and by Proclamation of the New York State Senate.

1461,"['distortion constant with   into embedded linearly be can   space Hilbert the that such   dimension maximal the is what , is   space normed dimensional - finite a about asked be can that questions basic the of One ?']","In mathematics, an embedding (or imbedding) is one instance of some mathematical structure contained within another instance, such as a group that is a subgroup.

When some object  is said to be embedded in another object , the embedding is given by some injective and structure-preserving map . The precise meaning of ""structure-preserving"" depends on the kind of mathematical structure of which  and  are instances. In the terminology of category theory, a structure-preserving map is called a morphism.

The fact that a map  is an embedding is often indicated by the use of a ""hooked arrow"" (); thus:  (On the other hand, this notation is sometimes reserved for inclusion maps.)

Given  and , several different embeddings of  in  may be possible. In many cases of interest there is a standard (or ""canonical"") embedding, like those of the natural numbers in the integers, the integers in the rational numbers, the rational numbers in the real numbers, and the real numbers in the complex numbers. In such cases it is common to identify the domain  with its image  contained in , so that .

Topology and geometry

General topology

In general topology, an embedding is a homeomorphism onto its image. More explicitly, an injective continuous map  between topological spaces  and  is a topological embedding if  yields a homeomorphism between  and  (where  carries the subspace topology inherited from ). Intuitively then, the embedding  lets us treat  as a subspace of . Every embedding is injective and continuous. Every map that is injective, continuous and either open or closed is an embedding; however there are also embeddings which are neither open nor closed. The latter happens if the image  is neither an open set nor a closed set in .

For a given space , the existence of an embedding  is a topological invariant of . This allows two spaces to be distinguished if one is able to be embedded in a space while the other is not.

Related definitions

If the domain of a function  is a topological space then the function is said to be  if there exists some neighborhood  of this point such that the restriction  is injective. It is called  if it is locally injective around every point of its domain. Similarly, a  is a function for which every point in its domain has some neighborhood to which its restriction is a (topological, resp. smooth) embedding. 

Every injective function is locally injective but not conversely. Local diffeomorphisms, local homeomorphisms, and smooth immersions are all locally injective functions that are not necessarily injective. The inverse function theorem gives a sufficient condition for a continuously differentiable function to be (among other things) locally injective. Every fiber of a locally injective function  is necessarily a discrete subspace of its domain

Differential topology

In differential topology:
Let  and  be smooth manifolds and  be a smooth map. Then  is called an immersion if its derivative is everywhere injective. An embedding, or a smooth embedding, is defined to be an immersion which is an embedding in the topological sense mentioned above (i.e. homeomorphism onto its image). 
 
In other words, the domain of an embedding is diffeomorphic to its image, and in particular the image of an embedding must be a submanifold. An immersion is precisely a local embedding, i.e. for any point  there is a neighborhood  such that  is an embedding.

When the domain manifold is compact, the notion of a smooth embedding is equivalent to that of an injective immersion.

An important case is . The interest here is in how large  must be for an embedding, in terms of the dimension  of . The Whitney embedding theorem states that  is enough, and is the best possible linear bound. For example, the real projective space  of dimension , where  is a power of two, requires  for an embedding. However, this does not apply to immersions; for instance,  can be immersed in  as is explicitly shown by Boy's surface—which has self-intersections. The Roman surface fails to be an immersion as it contains cross-caps.

An embedding is proper if it behaves well with respect to boundaries: one requires the map  to be such that

, and
 is transverse to  in any point of .

The first condition is equivalent to having  and . The second condition, roughly speaking, says that  is not tangent to the boundary of .

Riemannian and pseudo-Riemannian geometry

In Riemannian geometry and pseudo-Riemannian geometry:
Let  and  be Riemannian manifolds or more generally pseudo-Riemannian manifolds.
An isometric embedding is a smooth embedding  which preserves the  (pseudo-)metric in the sense that  is equal to the pullback of  by , i.e. . Explicitly, for any two tangent vectors  we have

Analogously, isometric immersion is an immersion between (pseudo)-Riemannian manifolds which preserves the (pseudo)-Riemannian metrics.

Equivalently, in Riemannian geometry, an isometric embedding (immersion) is a smooth embedding (immersion) which preserves length of curves (cf. Nash embedding theorem).

Algebra
In general, for an algebraic category , an embedding between two -algebraic structures  and  is a -morphism  that is injective.

Field theory

In field theory, an embedding of a field  in a field  is a ring homomorphism .

The kernel of  is an ideal of  which cannot be the whole field , because of the condition . Furthermore, it is a well-known property of fields that their only ideals are the zero ideal and the whole field itself. Therefore, the kernel is , so any embedding of fields is a monomorphism. Hence,  is isomorphic to the subfield  of . This justifies the name embedding for an arbitrary homomorphism of fields.

Universal algebra and model theory

If  is a signature and  are -structures (also called -algebras in universal algebra or models in model theory), then a map  is a -embedding iff all of the following hold:
  is injective,
 for every -ary function symbol  and  we have ,
 for every -ary relation symbol  and  we have  iff 

Here  is a model theoretical notation equivalent to . In model theory there is also a stronger notion of elementary embedding.

Order theory and domain theory
In order theory, an embedding of partially ordered sets is a function  between partially ordered sets  and  such that

Injectivity of 
follows quickly from this definition. In domain theory, an additional requirement is that

 is directed.

Metric spaces

A mapping  of metric spaces is called an embedding
(with distortion ) if

for every  and some constant .

Normed spaces 

An important special case is that of normed spaces; in this case it is natural to consider linear embeddings.

One of the basic questions that can be asked about a finite-dimensional normed space  is, what is the maximal dimension  such that the Hilbert space  can be linearly embedded into  with constant distortion?

The answer is given by Dvoretzky's theorem.

Category theory

In category theory, there is no satisfactory and generally accepted definition of embeddings that is applicable in all categories. One would expect that all isomorphisms and all compositions of embeddings are embeddings, and that all embeddings are monomorphisms. Other typical requirements are: any extremal monomorphism is an embedding and embeddings are stable under pullbacks.

Ideally the class of all embedded subobjects of a given object, up to isomorphism, should also be small, and thus an ordered set. In this case, the category is said to be well powered with respect to the class of embeddings. This allows defining new local structures in the category (such as a closure operator).

In a concrete category, an embedding is a morphism  which is an injective function from the underlying set of  to the underlying set of  and is also an initial morphism in the following sense:
If  is a function from the underlying set of an object  to the underlying set of , and if its composition with  is a morphism , then  itself is a morphism.

A factorization system for a category also gives rise to a notion of embedding. If  is a factorization system, then the morphisms in  may be regarded as the embeddings, especially when the category is well powered with respect to . Concrete theories often have a factorization system in which  consists of the embeddings in the previous sense. This is the case of the majority of the examples given in this article.

As usual in category theory, there is a dual concept, known as quotient. All the preceding properties can be dualized.

An embedding can also refer to an embedding functor.

1537,"['Give I Would What ?', 'Forget I Shall ?', 'Beast or Bird ?', 'Care Not Thou Dost ?']","The Prince's Progress and Other Poems is Christina Rossetti's second volume of poetry, published by Macmillan in 1866. Christina's brother Dante Gabriel Rossetti designed the illustrations and bindings for the publication, just as he had for her first volume, Goblin Market and Other Poems. The Prince's Progress tells the story of a princess awaiting the return of her prince. After tarrying due to a series of temptations and self-indulgences, the prince returns only to find that the princess has died. Dante Gabriel Rossetti's frontispiece illustration depicts the grief-stricken prince upon hearing the news of his princesse's death; the title illustration depicts the princess staring longingly out the window as she waits for her prince to return. The 1866 edition contains 46 poems in addition to ""The Prince's Progress.""

Dante Gabriel Rossetti disagreed with the gaudy ornamentation of many Victorian books, and thus attempted to refine the heavily ornamented book with his own bindings. In this publication, he employs a combination of minimalist motifs and contemporary technology, seen specifically in the gold stamping. The hand and machine work of this design ensured the perpetuation of Rossetti’s aesthetic through wider accessibility.

The gold design makes reference to clasps and nailheads on medieval books, and it is repeated on both the cover and back of the book. In conjunction with the wood-engraved illustrations, this binding has an integrated role in the art of the book as a whole. In addition to the medieval allusion, the organic motifs reflect the theme of growth and change within the text. In this way, the binding becomes a part of the narrative.

1599,['– 1670 ( Katherine ?'],"Sir William Leveson-Gower, 4th Baronet (c. 1647 – 22 December 1691) was an English politician from the Leveson-Gower family.

Born William Gower, he was the second son of Sir Thomas Gower, 2nd Baronet and Frances, daughter and coheir of John Leveson.  He added the surname Leveson to his own in 1668, when he inherited the Trentham and Lilleshall estates of his maternal great-uncle, Sir Richard Leveson. Leveson-Gower married Lady Jane Granville (the eldest daughter of the 1st Earl of Bath) and they had five children:
Katherine (1670–?), who married Sir Edward Wyndham, 2nd Baronet,
John Leveson-Gower, later 1st Baron Gower (1675–1709).
Jane (d. 1725), who married the 4th Earl of Clarendon).
Richard (died unmarried)
William (died unmarried),

Leveson-Gower inherited his childless nephew's baronetcy in 1689 and on his own death two years later, was succeeded by his eldest surviving son, John.

Two of Leveson-Gower's well-known direct modern-day descendants are broadcaster Claire Balding and comedian Miranda Hart.

1748,"['"" Daddy Your \'s Who "" and "" Issues Visa "" , "" Following Cult "" , "" Worms of Can a Half "" titled were episodes The ?']","Deborah Frances-White is a London-based comedian, author and screenwriter who also delivers corporate seminars on subjects including charisma, diversity and inclusion. She has both British and Australian citizenship. She hosts the podcasts Global Pillage and The Guilty Feminist. She uses the platform and network she has built through The Guilty Feminist to help multiple charities, especially relating to refugees and/or human rights.

Early life
Frances-White was born in Australia and adopted at ten days old. She grew up in Brisbane, Queensland. Her family converted to Jehovah’s Witnesses when she was a teenager; Frances-White has since left the community and describes herself as an atheist. During her gap year, she moved to London and later studied English at Harris Manchester College, Oxford University.

Career
Frances-White is one of three directors at the improv theatre company The Spontaneity Shop, which she co-founded with Tom Salinsky in 1996. After developing a number of improvisation formats at The Spontaneity Shop (including the improvised romantic comedy DreamDate which had a pilot made for ITV), Frances-White turned to stand-up comedy. Her first significant solo show was How to Get Almost Anyone to Want to Sleep With You which she performed at The Edinburgh Festival Fringe in 2007 and at The Melbourne International Comedy Festival in 2008 where she also hosted The Melbourne International Comedy Festival Roadshow.

Frances-White's recent shows have been more personal. Cult Following (2012) dealt with her experiences as a teenage Jehovah's Witness, Half a Can of Worms (2013) was about tracking down her biological family and Friend of a Friend of Dorothy (2015) was about feminism, sexism and homophobia.

Frances-White has continued to develop new improvisation formats. Voices in Your Head is a show which allows comedians, improvisers and actors to create comedy characters while the audience watches. Guests have included Phill Jupitus, Sara Pascoe, Russell Tovey, Mike McShane and Hannibal Buress. In 2015 she created The Beau Zeaux a long-form improvised comedy featuring a rotating cast including Marcus Brigstocke, Thom Tuck, Rachel Parris, Brendan Murphy, Ed Coleman, Milly Thomas and Pippa Evans. Guests have included Russell Tovey and Dan Starkey.

Her BBC Radio 4 series Deborah Frances-White Rolls the Dice was first broadcast in spring 2015 and featured stories about her adoption, green card marriage, and the quest to find her biological family. The episodes were titled ""Half a Can of Worms"", ""Cult Following"", ""Visa Issues"" and ""Who's Your Daddy""? In January 2016, the show won Frances-White the Writers' Guild of Great Britain award for ""Best Radio Comedy"". A second series was first broadcast in autumn 2016.

On television, Frances-White has appeared as a guest on Mock the Week, Have I Got News for You, Politics Live and Tonight With Vladimir Putin.

With Sofie Hagen, she created the podcast The Guilty Feminist. She is also the creator and host of the podcast Global Pillage, a comedy panel show. In 2019, The Guilty Feminist and Amnesty International joined forces for the Secret Policeman’s Tour, consisting of three shows with comedy, music and discussion, all in support of human rights.

Corporate work
Frances-White regularly appears at corporate events speaking about confidence, charisma, diversity and sexism. Her TEDx talk on Charisma vs Stage-Fright was cited by James Caan as the secret of his presenting skills.

Writing
With her writing partner Philippa Waller, Frances-White contributed two episodes of Young Dracula in 2014. She has co-written two books: The Improv Handbook with Tom Salinsky and Off the Mic with Marsha Shandur, both published by Bloomsbury. She writes for Standard Issue Magazine. In 2018, Virago published The Guilty Feminist, a spin-off from her podcast. Her debut feature film, the comedy thriller Say My Name, premiered on 19 March 2019.

Religion
Frances-White became a Jehovah's Witness while still a teenager. Her years in the religion and how she left it were the focus of her 2012 Edinburgh Fringe stand-up comedy show and two of the episodes of her BBC Radio 4 show Deborah Frances-White Rolls the Dice.

1760,"[""Sheep Green the is Where book picture 's children winning award her for known best is She ?""]","Judy Horacek (born 12 November 1961) is an Australian cartoonist, artist, writer and children's book creator. She is best known for her award winning children's picture book Where is the Green Sheep? with Mem Fox, and her weekly cartoons in The Age newspaper. Horacek's latest book is Now or Never (2020), her tenth cartoon collection. A new picture book with Mem Fox, Bonnie and Ben Rhyme Again came out in October 2018.

In 2005, a selection of her work was acquired by the National Library of Australia for its collection. She said at the time that ""I really like being recognised for having done work that is part of the social discourse. And it's always nice to see cartoons get another lease on life – now they represent a particular time and context and become part of the portrait of who we [Australians] are"".

Life

Horacek graduated with a BA from the University of Melbourne in 1991, majoring in Fine Arts and English. She then studied for a Diploma in Museum Studies at Victoria University.  In 2007, she graduated with a Bachelor of Arts (Visual) in Printmedia and Drawing from Australian National University.

She lives in Melbourne.

Writing

Horacek started her career as a writer, and was a member of a community writing group in North Melbourne. Words are an important part of her cartoons, and sometimes dominate the pictures.

After illustrating a children's picture book for Mem Fox, she began to write and illustrate her own children's books, something she had always wanted to do.

Cartoons

""My life has been a quest to find new and better place to stick cartoons"", Horacek has said. Accordingly, her cartoons can be found in newspapers and magazines, online, on aprons and teatowels, on mugs, on fridge magnets and cards, and as limited edition prints. Her cartoons have been described as whimsical and quirky. As she says, ""I take every day situations and make them strange""

It was her interest in feminism which ""drove Horacek's early work and established her reputation as a cartoonist"". Since then, in addition to an ongoing interest in women's issues, her cartoons have covered a wide range of social and political issues such as the Australian Republican Movement, immigration, indigenous issues and FlyBuys. Cartoonist Peter Nicholson describes her work as follows:

Horacek's first commissioned work for The Age newspaper was published on International Women's Day 1995, next to the obituary of Senator Olive Zakharov. This was her cartoon, Woman with Altitude, a work which has since appeared on fridge magnets greeting cards, tea-towels and T-shirts. In 2007, she said that ""The woman with altitude ... represents who we could be"". At various times she has had regular spots in such newspapers and magazines as The Age, The Weekend Australian Magazine, The Canberra Times and the Australian Book Review.

Illustration
She illustrated Mem Fox's non-fiction book, Reading Magic, and in 2004 she illustrated her first children's book, Mem Fox's Where Is the Green Sheep?. It was shortlisted for several book awards, and in 2005 won the Children's Book Council of Australia Book of the Year – Early Childhood Award. She has since started writing her own children's books, the first being The Story of GROWL (2007), followed by ""These are My Hands"" (2008), ""These are My Feet"" (2009) and ""Yellow is my favourite colour""

1766,['this in shown measurements the correct please you would Sorry ?'],"The .222 Rimmed is a centrefire rifle cartridge, originating in Australia in the 1960s as a cartridge for single shot rifles, particularly the Martini Cadet action. Performance is similar to the .222 Remington on which it is based however loads should be reduced as the walls of the brass cases are generally thicker.
Extraction of cases that have been loaded to higher pressures can be difficult due to the inefficient extraction method utilised by the Martini Cadet.

Cases and loaded rounds were originally produced by the Super Cartridge Company. Brass is now available from the Bertram Bullet Company or can be made from 5.6x50mmR RWS cases.

The .222 Rimmed has also been used as a parent case for wildcats, similar to ones based on the .222 Remington, such as rimmed versions of the .17 Mach IV, the .17-222, and the .20 VarTarg.

Sorry would you please correct the measurements shown in this? - the case length as actually measured by me, is 1.69 to 1.70, not 1.85. Point of logic: 1.85 would make it longer than the .223!! All dimensions on the 222 rimmed are identical to the 222, I have measured it all, except that the rimmed brass has a noticeable rim, and no indentation at the base. I resize my 222 rimmed brass using a 222 die set and a 357 magnum die holder. It first the martini cadet perfectly, and the 357 shell holder holds the case in the same place as a 222 shellholder would hold a rimless 222 case. In summary, the data for this cartridge should be made to match the 222 remington except that there is a rim and no indent near the base (extraction groove). This article actually confused me before I had seen 222 rimmed bullets in real life. It made me think they were not so similar, but they really are. I would like it updated so that others are not confused as I was, and will know to go ahead and buy a 222 die set and number 1 (357 mag) shellholder.

1775,"[""Understand You n't Do Gone Thee Get of Part What ?""]","The Geraldine Fibbers were an alt-country band founded in 1994 by Carla Bozulich.  Initially, band members included Bozulich, Daniel Keenan, Julie Fowells, William Tutton and Kevin Fitzgerald. While Bozulich had previously been known for noisy industrial music, The Geraldine Fibbers fused American roots music and blues-influenced punk.

The group always incorporated noise and experimentation into their sound, which has been mis-labeled as Alternative Country. In early 1996, Keenan departed, to be replaced by Nels Cline, the band shifting to an even more noisy, guitar-rock sound.  

Spin magazine named Lost Somewhere Between the Earth and My Home and Butch to their top albums of 1995 and 1997 lists, respectively.

Moss joined A Silver Mt. Zion in 2001. The Nels Cline Singers and an enormously diverse biography surround Nels Cline. In 2004 he joined the alternative band, Wilco. Fitzgerald has played with Eleni Mandell, The Circle Jerks and others. William Tutton has played with Brian Grillo, plays with Glenn Meadmore and does occasional recording for friends. Bozulich made her 4th album for her group, Evangelista on Constellation Records.  

In April 2017, it was announced that Lost Somewhere Between the Earth and My Home would be reissued on vinyl by Jealous Butcher Records on May 5, 2017. The reissue will be mixed for vinyl by Steve Fisk and include ""Bitter Honey"" and ""234"" from the original sessions, a previously unreleased studio version of ""You Doo Right"" featuring both Keenan and Cline on guitar, and a new song ""Thank You For Giving Me Life"" featuring Bozulich, Tutton, Fitzgerald, Cline and Moss as the lineup.

1776,"['ago while short a fighting been had he "" demons "" the these Are ?']","Heartless is a 2009 British horror film written and directed by Philip Ridley and starring Jim Sturgess, Noel Clarke, Clémence Poésy and Eddie Marsan. This was Ridley's first film in fourteen years since 1995's The Passion of Darkly Noon. The film garnered positive reception from critics who praised the performances and dark atmospheric tone that complemented the Faustian plot.

Plot
Jamie Morgan is a lonely, troubled photographer with a large heart-shaped birthmark that covers nearly half of his face. He is still a virgin at 25 because a lifetime of alienation and bullying have left him unable to make friends or attract women. At the photographic studio he shares with his brother and nephew Lee, he meets aspiring model Tia.

As Jamie develops photos from a shoot, he notices a disturbing face looking at him from the window of a house. When he goes back to investigate, he follows a suspicious man to a group of hooded vandals around a fire, who emit eerie shrieks. One notices Jamie and shrieks at him. Jamie is shocked to see a demonic lizard-like face under the hood, with huge pin-like teeth. Over time Jamie becomes aware of a series of horrific murders by Molotov cocktail that have been occurring in the neighbourhood. A witness to one of the murders, a little Asian girl, tells a TV reporter that they weren't wearing masks; the demonic faces were real. Jamie's neighbour and new-found friend, A.J. turns up with a huge wound that looks as if it was caused by claw marks. Parts of his dismembered body then turn up in the local area.

Jamie and his mother are walking in the neighborhood when they are attacked by the demonic gang. His mother is immolated while Jamie watches helplessly, and he is savagely beaten and left for dead. While unconscious in hospital he glimpses a man in his dream who says he is waiting for Jamie. Later, he receives a phone call from a man with the same voice, and is guided to the apartment of Papa B and his assistant Belle, who looks just like the little Asian girl from the TV report. Papa B offers a Faustian bargain: Jamie must fulfil Papa B's desire for chaos with occasional acts of vandalism in return for the removal of his birthmarks. Despite Papa B admitting that he was responsible for his mother's death as a way of bringing Jamie to him, Jamie consents and they shake hands. Jamie is told to immolate himself with a Molotov cocktail in order to be reborn. Jamie miraculously survives and peels away his burned skin to reveal perfect, unblemished skin.

Initially things go well: a chance meeting with Tia leads a newly confident Jamie to spend the day with her in the park, where his beloved, deceased father first taught him to use a camera. The deal sours, however, when the Weapons Man arrives: Papa B has reneged on their bargain and Jamie must now commit murder by ripping the heart from a living victim. The Weapons Man tortures Jamie until he agrees to kill a street hustler. His hope for a better life returns after he and Tia become lovers. During this time Belle also comes to live with Jamie, after Papa B beat her in a fit of rage. She starts calling Jamie ""Dad"" and becomes a bit of a guide to him, kindly and pragmatically explaining that he has no choice but to kill, to save his own life—and Belle's. But Papa B is outraged at Belle's betrayal and as punishment demands that Jamie kill a new victim—Tia.

Tia asks Jamie to put a photo album in his work safe, and it is revealed that Tia and Lee intended to steal his late mother's jewellery. Tia had initially meant only to help Lee gain access to the safe, but she ended up sincerely falling in love with Jamie. During the ensuing struggle Tia is accidentally shot and killed, and Lee is seriously wounded by ""She"", a gang leader to whom he owed money, and who wears a metallic claw in place of a severed hand.

Jamie is pursued by She but fights back and kills him. He notices that a mark on a wall from She's claw looks just like the wound received by A.J. Jamie tells Belle, who has turned up from nowhere, that she must flee to stay safe, and she disappears. Jamie spies himself in a mirror and sees that his birthmark has returned, and with it the knowledge that it had been there the entire time, even while he was courting Tia. Jamie confronts Papa B's minions and fights them off, but when faced with a larger demon, Papa B in his true form, runs away. Viewers are left to decide for themselves whether Papa B cheated Jamie by never removing the birthmark, or if much of what transpired was the product of Jamie's imagination.

After waking up indoors, Jamie staggers outside. On the ground he sees several masks with sharp teeth, and looks up to see several masked and hooded gang members. But these are ordinary masks made of sacks, not the realistic demon faces Jamie has seen so far. Are these the ""demons"" he had been fighting a short while ago? Jamie now recalls himself walking and talking with Belle—only now he appears to converse with empty space. As realisation sinks in, a gang member catches him with a Molotov cocktail. As he stands still and burns to death, Jamie experiences a vision of his father, who tells him that you can only see the stars in the blackness of the night. Whether this is a memory or a near-death experience is left unclear. Jamie ascends into bright light. The light fades into a field of stars in the night sky, mirroring the words spoken by his father.

Music
The film featured a number of original songs for which Ridley himself had written the lyrics. The music for these songs were composed by Ridley's long-time collaborator Nick Bicât who had previously written music for productions of Ridley's stage plays and films. On Nick Bicât's website it states that the songs had been written to act ""like a Greek chorus, commenting on the action. Every song in the film—whether heard on the radio, in a club, or used as part of the score"".

As well as being the lead actor, Jim Sturgess also sang two of the songs in the film's soundtrack. When talking about the film's music Ridley explained that Jim Sturgess heard some of the songs and loved them. He wondered if, perhaps, it would be right for him to sing a couple. To be honest, Jim and I had discussed this possibility much earlier (Jim's talents are boundless. As well as being one of the greatest actors around, he is also a great singer...not to mention songwriter, poet—the list goes on!). Initially, we had both agreed it probably wouldn't be right. But as the film progressed, and the exploration of Jamie's mind in the film become ever more obsessive...well, it just seemed to make total sense for Jim to perform the two songs most pertinent to Jamie's state of mind: the theme music, Heartless, and Another Me.""

The film's first soundtrack album - named Heartless - was distributed on 1 January 2010 and later online 17 May 2010 by Universal Music Digital Services and contained all the songs, the listing of which are below:

Release
The film had its premiere on 31 August 2009 at Film 4's Fright Fest. The film was also shown as part of the 2009 Cork Film Festival and was part of the Fantasia Festival 2010.

The film was noted for being one of the first British films to almost have a simultaneous multi-platform release, being released in cinemas 21 May and distributed on DVD, Blu-ray and Digital Download just four days later on 25 May 2010.

The film has since been released as a digital rental on the BFI player.

Critical reception
Heartless received generally positive reviews from critics. , the film holds a 78% approval rating on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 40 reviews with an average rating of 5.93/10. The website's critics consensus reads: ""Smart, well-acted, and unsettling, Heartless marks a mostly satisfying return to genre thrills for writer-director Philip Ridley."" Gary Goldstein of the Los Angeles Times credited the film to both Jim Sturgess for having ""a terrifically watchable presence,"" and director Philip Ridley for his compelling soundtrack and dark visual direction that ""even at its most seemingly outlandish remains intriguing and involving."" Joe Leydon of Variety praised the film for the performances of both Sturgess and Marsan and the direction of scenes that give off a morose tone, concluding that, ""There's more mood than matter here, but suspenseful atmospherics effectively distract from minor plot holes."" Kyle Smith of the New York Post commented on how the Faust theme and sappy conclusion paled in comparison to the ""macabre wit"" that Ridley displays throughout the film, calling it ""an uneasy mixture of B-movie shocks, social commentary and sentimentality that shows a potent imagination at work.""

Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club gave the film a ""B−"", crediting its second-half moral tale and the brief appearances by Marsan and Spall but felt it was hampered by the first half with its ""plodding pace, portentous tone, and underdeveloped characters"", concluding that, ""Ridley is a master of atmosphere and mood, but his fantastical conceits require a strong protagonist who isn't defined first by his birthmark, then by its absence."" Ben Rawson-Jones of Digital Spy felt the film wasted its main cast with a promising plot that was half-heartedly executed with failed horror elements and dialogue that telegraphs the story, saying that, ""The form and content are a perfect match in Heartless. Both are desperately terrible."" He gave the film 1 star out of 5. Nick Schager of Slant Magazine criticised Ridley for crafting a Faustian film with an empty-headed protagonist, telegraphed plot elements, mixed moral themes and a muddled third act, giving the film 1 star out of 4.

2044,"['whom influences Who ?', 'Holocaust the after faith of kind any have still people can How ?']","Jewish philosophy () includes all philosophy carried out by Jews, or in relation to the religion of Judaism. Until modern Haskalah (Jewish Enlightenment) and Jewish emancipation, Jewish philosophy was preoccupied with attempts to reconcile coherent new ideas into the tradition of Rabbinic Judaism, thus organizing emergent ideas that are not necessarily Jewish into a uniquely Jewish scholastic framework and world-view. With their acceptance into modern society, Jews with secular educations embraced or developed entirely new philosophies to meet the demands of the world in which they now found themselves.

Medieval re-discovery of ancient Greek philosophy among the Geonim of 10th century Babylonian academies brought rationalist philosophy into Biblical-Talmudic Judaism. The philosophy was generally in competition with Kabbalah. Both schools would become part of classic rabbinic literature, though the decline of scholastic rationalism coincided with historical events which drew Jews to the Kabbalistic approach. For Ashkenazi Jews, emancipation and encounter with secular thought from the 18th century onwards altered how philosophy was viewed. Ashkenazi and Sephardi communities had later more ambivalent interaction with secular culture than in Western Europe. In the varied responses to modernity, Jewish philosophical ideas were developed across the range of emerging religious movements. These developments could be seen as either continuations of or breaks from the canon of rabbinic philosophy of the Middle Ages, as well as the other historical dialectic aspects of Jewish thought, and resulted in diverse contemporary Jewish attitudes to philosophical methods.

Ancient Jewish philosophy

Philosophy in the Bible 

Rabbinic literature sometimes views Abraham as a philosopher. Some have suggested that Abraham introduced a philosophy learned from Melchizedek; further, some Jews ascribe the Sefer Yetzirah ""Book of Creation"" to Abraham.  A midrash describes how Abraham understood this world to have a creator and director by comparing this world to ""a house with a light in it"", what is now called the argument from design.  Psalms contains invitations to admire the wisdom of God through his works; from this, some scholars suggest, Judaism harbors a Philosophical under-current. Ecclesiastes is often considered to be the only genuine philosophical work in the Hebrew Bible; King Solomon, its author, seeks to understand the place of human beings in the world and life's meaning.

Philo of Alexandria 

Philo attempted to fuse and harmonize Greek and Jewish philosophy through allegory, which he learned from Jewish exegesis and Stoicism. Philo attempted to make his philosophy the means of defending and justifying Jewish religious truths. These truths he regarded as fixed and determinate, and philosophy was used as an aid to truth, and a means of arriving at it. To this end Philo chose from philosophical tenets of Greeks, refusing those that did not harmonize with Judaism such as Aristotle's doctrine of the eternity and indestructibility of the world.

Dr. Bernard Revel, in dissertation on Karaite halakha, points to writings of a 10th-century Karaite, Jacob Qirqisani, who quotes Philo, illustrating how Karaites made use of Philo's works in development of Karaite Judaism. Philo's works became important to Medieval Christian scholars who leveraged the work of Karaites to lend credence to their claims that ""these are the beliefs of Jews"" - a technically correct, yet deceptive, attribution.

Jewish scholarship after destruction of Second Temple 
With the Roman destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE, Second Temple Judaism was in disarray, but Jewish traditions were preserved especially thanks to the shrewd maneuvers of Johanan ben Zakai, who saved the Sanhedrin and moved it to Yavne. Philosophical speculation was not a central part of Rabbinic Judaism, although some have seen the Mishnah as a philosophical work. Rabbi Akiva has also been viewed as a philosophical figure. 
His statements include: 
 ""How favored is man, for he was created after an image. For in an image, Elohim made man."" (Gen. ix. 6)
 ""Everything is foreseen; but freedom [of will] is given to every man.""
 ""The world is governed by mercy... but the divine decision is made by the preponderance of the good or bad in one's actions.""

After the Bar Kokhba revolt, rabbinic scholars gathered in Tiberias and Safed to re-assemble and re-assess Judaism, its laws, theology, liturgy, beliefs and leadership structure. In 219 CE, the Sura Academy (from which Jewish Kalam emerged many centuries later) was founded by Abba Arika. For the next five centuries, Talmudic academies focused upon reconstituting Judaism and little, if any, philosophic investigation was pursued.

Who influences whom? 

Rabbinic Judaism had limited philosophical activity until it was challenged by Islam, Karaite Judaism, and Christianity—with Tanach, Mishnah, and Talmud, there was no need for a philosophic framework.  From an economic viewpoint, Radhanite trade dominance was being usurped by coordinated Christian and Islamic forced-conversions, and torture, compelling Jewish scholars to understand nascent economic threats.  These investigations triggered new ideas and intellectual exchange among Jewish and Islamic scholars in the areas of jurisprudence, mathematics, astronomy, logic and philosophy.  Jewish scholars influenced Islamic scholars and Islamic scholars influenced Jewish scholars.  Contemporary scholars continue to debate who was Muslim and who was Jew—some ""Islamic scholars"" were ""Jewish scholars"" prior to forced conversion to Islam, some Jewish scholars willingly converted to Islam, such as Abdullah ibn Salam, while others later reverted to Judaism, and still others, born and raised as Jews, were ambiguous in their religious beliefs such as ibn al-Rawandi, although they lived according to the customs of their neighbors.

Around 700 CE, ʿAmr ibn ʿUbayd Abu ʿUthman al-Basri introduces two streams of thought that influence Jewish, Islamic and Christian scholars:
Qadariyah
 Bahshamiyya Muʿtazila

The story of the Bahshamiyya Muʿtazila and Qadariyah is as important, if not more so, as the intellectual symbiosis of Judaism and Islam in Islamic Spain.

Around 733 CE, Mar Natronai ben Habibai moves to Kairouan, then to Spain, transcribing the Talmud Bavli for the Academy at Kairouan from memory—later taking a copy with him to Spain.

Karaism 

Borrowing from the Mutakallamin of Basra, the Karaites were the first Jewish group to subject Judaism to Muʿtazila. Rejecting the Talmud and rabbinical tradition, Karaites took liberty to reinterpret the Tanakh. This meant abandoning foundational Jewish belief structures. Some scholars suggest that the major impetus for the formation of Karaism was a reaction to the rapid rise of Shi'i Islam, which recognized Judaism as a fellow monotheistic faith but claimed that it detracted from monotheism by deferring to rabbinic authority. Karaites absorbed certain aspects of Jewish sects such as the followers of Abu Isa (Shi'ism), Maliki (Sunnis) and Yudghanites (Sufis), who were influenced by East-Islamic scholarship yet deferred to the Ash'ari when contemplating the sciences.

Philosophic synthesis begins 

The spread of Islam throughout the Middle East and North Africa rendered Muslim all that was once Jewish.  Greek philosophy, science, medicine and mathematics was absorbed by Jewish scholars living in the Arab world due to Arabic translations of those texts; remnants of the Library of Alexandria.  Early Jewish converts to Islam brought with them stories from their heritage, known as Isra'iliyyat, which told of the Banu Isra'il, the pious men of ancient Israel.  One of the most famous early mystics of Sufism, Hasan of Basra, introduced numerous Isra'iliyyat legends into Islamic scholarship, stories that went on to become representative of Islamic mystical ideas of piety of Sufism.

Hai Gaon of Pumbedita Academy begins a new phase in Jewish scholarship and investigation (hakirah); Hai Gaon augments Talmudic scholarship with non-Jewish studies.  Hai Gaon was a savant with an exact knowledge of the theological movements of his time so much so that Moses ibn Ezra called him a mutakallim.  Hai was competent to argue with followers of Qadariyyah and Mutazilites, sometimes adopting their polemic methods.  Through correspondence with Talmudic Academies at Kairouan, Cordoba and Lucena, Hai Gaon passes along his discoveries to Talmudic scholars therein.

The teachings of the Brethren of Purity were carried to the West by the Cordovan hadith scholar and alchemist Maslama al-Qurṭubī (died 964), where they would be of central importance to the Jewish philosophers of Islamic Spain. One of the themes emphasized by the Brethren of Purity and adopted by most Spanish Jewish philosophers is the microcosm-macrocosm analogy. From the 10th century on, Spain became a center of philosophical learning as is reflected by the explosion of philosophical inquiry among Jews, Muslims and Christians.

Jewish philosophy before Maimonides

""Hiwi the Heretic"" 
According to Sa'adya Gaon, the Jewish community of Balkh (Afghanistan) was divided into two groups: ""Jews"" and ""people that are called Jews""; Hiwi al-Balkhi was a member of the latter.  Hiwi is generally considered to be the very first ""Jewish"" philosopher to subject the Pentateuch to critical analysis.  Hiwi is viewed by some scholars as an intellectually conflicted man torn between Judaism, Zoroastrianism, Gnostic Christianity, and Manichaean thought.

Hiwi espoused the belief that miraculous acts, described in the Pentateuch, are simply examples of people using their skills of reasoning to undertake, and perform, seemingly miraculous acts.  As examples of this position, he argued that the parting of the Red Sea was a natural phenomenon, and that Moses' claim to greatness lay merely in his ability to calculate the right moment for the crossing.  He also emphasized that the Egyptian magicians were able to reproduce several of Moses' ""miracles,"" proving that they could not have been so unique.  According to scholars, Hiwi's gravest mistake was having the Pentateuch redacted to reflect his own views - then had those redacted texts, which became popular,  distributed to children.  Since his views contradicted the views of both Rabbanite and Karaite scholars, Hiwi was declared a heretic.  In this context, however, we can also regard Hiwi, while flawed, as the very first critical biblical commentator; zealous rationalistic views of Hiwi parallel those of Ibn al-Rawandi.

Saʿadya Gaon dedicated an entire treatise, written in rhyming Hebrew, to a refutation of Ḥīwī's arguments, two fragments of which, preserved in the Cairo Geniza, have been published (Davidson, 1915; Schirmann, 1965). Ḥīwī's criticisms are also noted in Abraham ibn Ezra's commentary on the Pentateuch.  Sa'adya Gaon denounced Hiwi as an extreme rationalist, a ""Mulhidun"", or atheist/deviator.  Abraham Ibn Daud described HIwi as a sectarian who ""denied the Torah, yet used it to formulate a new Torah of his liking"".

Sa'adya Gaon 
Saadia Gaon, son of a proselyte, is considered the greatest early Jewish philosopher after Solomon. During his early years in Tulunid Egypt, the Fatimid Caliphate ruled Egypt; the leaders of the Tulunids were Ismaili Imams.  Their influence upon the Jewish academies of Egypt resonate in the works of Sa'adya.  Sa'adya's Emunoth ve-Deoth (""Beliefs and Opinions"") was originally called Kitab al-Amanat wal-l'tikadat (""Book of the Articles of Faith and Doctrines of Dogma""); it was the first systematic presentation and philosophic foundation of the dogmas of Judaism, completed at Sura Academy in 933 CE.

Little known is that Saadia traveled to Tiberias in 915CE to study with Abū 'l-Kathīr Yaḥyā ibn Zakariyyāʾ al-Katib al-Tabari (Tiberias), a Jewish theologian and Bible translator from Tiberias whose main claim to fame is the fact that Saadia Gaon studied with him at some point. He is not mentioned in any Jewish source, and apart from the Andalusian heresiographer and polemicist Ibn Hazm, who mentions him as a Jewish mutakallim (rational theologian), our main source of information is the Kitāb al-Tanbīh by the Muslim historian al-Masʿūdī (d. 956). In his brief survey of Arabic translations of the Bible, al-Masʿūdī states that the Israelites rely for exegesis and translation of the Hebrew books—i.e., the Torah, Prophets, and Psalms, twenty-four books in all, he says—on a number of Israelites whom they praise highly, almost all of whom he has met in person. He mentions Abū ʾl-Kathīr as one of them, and also Saadia (""Saʿīd ibn Yaʿqūb al-Fayyūmī"").  Regardless of what we do not know, Saadia traveled to Tiberias (home of the learned scribes and exegetes) to learn and he chose Abū 'l-Kathīr Yaḥyā ibn Zakariyyāʾ al-Katib al-Tabariya. The extent of Abū ʾl-Kathīr's influence on Saadia's thought cannot be established, however.

Abū ʾl-Kathīr's profession is also unclear. al-Masʿūdī calls him a kātib, which has been variously interpreted as secretary, government official, (biblical) scribe, Masorete, and book copyist. For lack of further information, some scholars have tried to identify Abū ʾl-Kathīr with the Hebrew grammarian Abū ʿAlī Judah ben ʿAllān, likewise of Tiberias, who seems to have been a Karaite Jew. However, al-Masūdī unequivocally describes Abu ʾl-Kathīr (as well as his student Saadia) as an ashmaʿthī (Rabbanite).

In ""Book of the Articles of Faith and Doctrines of Dogma"" Saadia declares the rationality of the Jewish religion with the caveat that reason must capitulate wherever it contradicts tradition. Dogma takes precedence over reason. Saadia closely followed the rules of the Muʿtazila school of Abu Ali al-Jubba'i in composing his works.  It was Saadia who laid foundations for Jewish rationalist theology which built upon the work of the Muʿtazila, thereby shifting Rabbinic Judaism from mythical explanations of the rabbis to reasoned explanations of the intellect.  Saadia advanced the criticisms of Muʿtazila by Ibn al-Rawandi.

David ibn Merwan al-Mukkamas 

David ibn Merwan al-Mukkamas was author of the earliest known Jewish philosophical work of the Middle Ages, a commentary on the Sefer Yetzirah; he is regarded as the father of Jewish medieval philosophy. Sl-Mukkamas was first to introduce the methods of Kalam into Judaism and the first Jew to mention Aristotle in his writings.  He was a proselyte of Rabbinic Judaism (not Karaite Judaism, as some argue); al-Mukkamas was a student of physician, and renowned Christian philosopher, Hana.  His close interaction with Hana, and his familial affiliation with Islam gave al-Mukkamas a unique view of religious belief and theology.

In 1898 Abraham Harkavy discovered, in Imperial Library of St. Petersburg, fifteen of the twenty chapters of David's philosophical work entitled Ishrun Maḳalat (Twenty Chapters) of which 15 survive.  One of the oldest surviving witnesses to early Kalām, it begins with epistemological investigations, turns to proofs of the creation of the world and the subsequent existence of a Creator, discusses the unity of the Creator (including the divine attributes), and concludes with theodicy (humanity and revelation) and a refutation of other religions (mostly lost).

In 915 CE, Sa'adya Gaon left for Palestine, where, according to al-Masʿūdī (Tanbīh, 113), he perfected his education at the feet of Abū 'l-Kathīr Yaḥyā ibn Zakariyyāʾ al-Katib al-Tabari (d. 320/932). The latter is also mentioned by Ibn Ḥazm in his K. al-Fiṣlal wa 'l-niḥal, iii, 171, as being, together with Dāwūd ibn Marwān al-Muqammiṣ and Sa'adya himself, one of the mutakallimūn of the Jews.

Since al-Muqammiṣ made few references to specifically Jewish issues and very little of his work was translated from Arabic into Hebrew, he was largely forgotten by  Jewish tradition. Nonetheless, he had a significant impact on subsequent Jewish philosophical followers of the Kalām, such as Saʿadya Gaon.

Samuel ibn Naghrillah 
Samuel ibn Naghrillah, born in Mérida, Spain, lived in Córdoba and was a child prodigy and student of Hanoch ben Moshe. Samuel ibn Naghrillah, Hasdai ibn Shaprut, and Moshe ben Hanoch founded the Lucena Yeshiva that produced such brilliant scholars as Isaac ibn Ghiyyat and Maimon ben Yosef, the father of Maimonides. Ibn Naghrillah's son, Yosef, provided refuge for two sons of Hezekiah Gaon; Daud Ibn Chizkiya Gaon Ha-Nasi and Yitzhak Ibn Chizkiya Gaon Ha-Nasi.  Though not a philosopher, he did build the infrastructure to allow philosophers to thrive.  In 1070 the gaon Isaac ben Moses ibn Sakri of Denia, Spain traveled to the East and acted as rosh yeshivah of the Baghdad Academy.

Solomon ibn Gabirol 

Solomon ibn Gabirol was born in Málaga then moved to Valencia.  Ibn Gabirol was one of the first teachers of Neoplatonism in Europe. His role has been compared to that of Philo. Ibn Gabirol occidentalized Greco-Arabic philosophy and restored it to Europe.  The philosophical teachings of Philo and ibn Gabirol were largely ignored by fellow Jews; the parallel may be extended by adding that Philo and ibn Gabirol both exercised considerable influence in secular circles; Philo upon early Christianity and Ibn Gabirol upon the scholars of medieval Christianity. Christian scholars, including Albertus Magnus and  Thomas Aquinas, defer to him frequently.

Abraham bar-Hiyya Ha-Nasi 

Abraham bar Hiyya, of Barcelona and later Arles-Provence, was a student of his father Hiyya al-Daudi and one of the most important figures in the scientific movement which made the Jews of Provence, Spain and Italy the intermediaries between Averroism, Muʿtazila and Christian Europe. He aided this scientific movement by original works, translations and as interpreter for another translator, Plato Tiburtinus. Bar-Hiyya's best student was v.  His philosophical works are ""Meditation of the Soul"", an ethical work written from a rationalistic religious viewpoint, and an apologetic epistle addressed to Judah ben Barzillai.

Hibat Allah 
Originally known by his Hebrew name Nethanel Baruch ben Melech al-Balad, Abu'l-Barakāt al-Baghdādī, known as Hibat Allah, was a Jewish philosopher and physicist and father-in-law of Maimonides who converted to Islam in his twilight years - once head of the Baghdad Yeshiva and considered the leading philosopher of Iraq.

Historians differ over the motive for his conversion to Islam. Some suggest it was a reaction to a social slight inflicted upon him because he was a Jew, while others suggest he was forcibly converted at the edge of a sword (which prompted Maimonides to comment upon Anusim). Despite his conversion to Islam, his works continued to be studied at the Jewish Baghdad Academy, a well-known academy, into the thirteenth century. He was a follower of Avicenna's teaching, who proposed an explanation of the acceleration of falling bodies by the accumulation of successive increments of power with successive increments of velocity.

His writings include Kitāb al-Muʿtabar (""The Book of What Has Been Established by Personal Reflection""); a philosophical commentary on the Kohelet, written in Arabic using Hebrew aleph bet; and the treatise ""On the Reason Why the Stars Are Visible at Night and Hidden in Daytime."" According to Hibat Allah, Kitāb al-Muʿtabar consists in the main of critical remarks jotted down by him over the years while reading philosophical text, and published at the insistence of his friends, in the form of a philosophical work.

Nethan'el al-Fayyumi 

Natan'el al-Fayyumi of Yemen, was the twelfth-century author of Bustan al-Uqul (""Garden of Intellects""), a Jewish version of Ismaili Shi'i doctrines. Like the Ismailis, Natan'el al-Fayyumi argued that God sent different prophets to various nations of the world, containing legislations suited to the particular temperament of each individual nation.  Ismaili doctrine holds that a single universal religious truth lies at the root of the different religions. Some Jews accepted this model of religious pluralism, leading them to view Muhammad as a legitimate prophet, though not Jewish, sent to preach to the Arabs, just as the Hebrew prophets had been sent to deliver their messages to Israel; others refused this notion in entirety.

Bahya ben Joseph ibn Paquda 

Bahye ben Yosef Ibn Paquda, of Zaragoza, was author of the first Jewish system of ethics Al Hidayah ila Faraid al-hulub, (""Guide to the Duties of the Heart"").  Bahya often followed the method of the Arabian encyclopedists known as ""the Brethren of Purity"" but adopts some of Sufi tenets rather than Ismaili.  According to Bahya, the Torah appeals to reason and knowledge as proofs of God's existence.  It is therefore a duty incumbent upon every one to make God an object of speculative reason and knowledge, in order to arrive at true faith.  Baḥya borrows from Sufism and Jewish Kalam integrating them into Neoplatonism.  Proof that Bahya borrowed from Sufism is underscored by the fact that the title of his eighth gate, Muḥasabat al-Nafs (""Self-Examination""), is reminiscent of the Sufi  Abu Abd Allah Ḥarith Ibn-Asad, who has been surnamed El Muḥasib (""the self-examiner""), because—say his biographers—""he was always immersed in introspection""

Yehuda Ha-Levi and the Kuzari 

Judah Halevi of Toledo, Spain defended Rabbinic Judaism against Islam, Christianity and Karaite Judaism. He was a student of Moses ibn Ezra whose education came from Isaac ibn Ghiyyat; trained as a Rationalist, he shed it in favor of Neoplatonism.  Like al-Ghazali, Judah Halevi attempted to liberate religion from the bondage of philosophical systems.  In particular, in a work written in Arabic Kitab al-Ḥujjah wal-Dalil fi Nuṣr al-Din al-Dhalil, translated by Judah ben Saul ibn Tibbon, by the title Kuzari he elaborates upon his views of Judaism relative to other religions of the time.

Abraham ibn Daud 
Abraham ibn Daud was a student of Rabbi Baruch ben Yitzhak Ibn Albalia, his maternal uncle.  Ibn Daud's philosophical work written in Arabic, Al-'akidah al-Rafiyah (""The Sublime Faith""), has been preserved in Hebrew by the title Emunah Ramah.  Ibn Daud did not introduce a new philosophy, but he was the first to introduce a more thorough systematic form derived from Aristotle.  Accordingly, Hasdai Crescas mentions Ibn Daud as the only Jewish philosopher among the predecessors of Maimonides.  Overshadowed by Maimonides, ibn Daud's Emunah Ramah, a work to which Maimonides was indebted, received little notice from later philosophers.  ""True philosophy"", according to Ibn Daud, ""does not entice us from religion; it tends rather to strengthen and solidify it. Moreover, it is the duty of every thinking Jew to become acquainted with the harmony existing between the fundamental doctrines of Judaism and those of philosophy, and, wherever they seem to contradict one another, to seek a mode of reconciling them"".

Maimonides 

Maimonides wrote The Guide for the Perplexed — his most influential philosophic work. He was a student of his father, Rabbi Maimon ben Yosef (a student of Joseph ibn Migash) in Cordoba, Spain.  When his family fled Spain, for Fez, Maimonides enrolled in the Academy of Fez and studied under Rabbi Yehuda Ha-Kohen Ibn Soussan — a student of Isaac Alfasi. Maimonides strove to reconcile Aristotelian philosophy and science with the teachings of Torah. In some ways his position was parallel to that of Averroes; in reaction to the attacks on Avicennian Aristotelism, Maimonides embraced and defended a stricter Aristotelism without Neoplatonic additions.  The principles which inspired all of Maimonides' philosophical activity was identical those of Abraham Ibn Daud: there can be no contradiction between the truths which God has revealed and the findings of the human intellect in science and philosophy. Maimonides departed from the teachings of Aristotle by suggesting that the world is not eternal, as Aristotle taught, but was created ex nihilo.  In ""Guide for the Perplexed"" (1:17 & 2:11)"" Maimonides explains that Israel lost its Mesorah in exile, and with it ""we lost our science and philosophy — only to be rejuvenated in Al Andalus within the context of interaction and intellectual investigation of Jewish, Christian and Muslim texts.

Medieval Jewish philosophy after Maimonides 
Maimonides writings almost immediately came under attack from Karaites, Dominican Christians, Tosafists of Provence, Ashkenaz and Al Andalus. Scholars suggest that Maimonides instigated the Maimonidean Controversy when he verbally attacked Samuel ben Ali (""Gaon of Baghdad"") as ""one whom people accustom from his youth to believe that there is none like him in his generation,"" and he sharply attacked the ""monetary demands"" of the academies. Samuel ben Ali was an anti-Maimonidean operating in Babylon to undermine the works of Maimonides and those of Maimonides' patrons (the Al-Constantini family from North Africa). To illustrate the reach of the Maimonidean Controversy, Samuel ben Ali, the chief opponent of Maimonides in the East, was excommunicated by Daud Ibn Hodaya al Daudi (Exilarch of Mosul). Maimonides' attacks on Samuel ben Ali may not have been entirely altruistic given the position of Maimonides' in-laws in competing Yeshivas.

In Western Europe, the controversy was halted by the burning of Maimonides' works by Christian Dominicans in 1232. Avraham son of Rambam, continued fighting for his father's beliefs in the East; desecration of Maimonides' tomb, at Tiberias by Jews, was a profound shock to Jews throughout the Diaspora and caused all to pause and reflect upon what was being done to the fabric of Jewish culture. This compelled many anti-Maimonideans to recant their assertions and realize what cooperation with Christians meant to them, their texts and their communities.

Maimonidean controversy flared up again at the beginning of the fourteenth century when Rabbi Shlomo ben Aderet, under influence from Asher ben Jehiel, issued a cherem on ""any member of the community who, being under twenty-five years, shall study the works of the Greeks on natural science and metaphysics.""

Contemporary Kabbalists, Tosafists and Rationalists continue to engage in lively, sometimes caustic, debate in support of their positions and influence in the Jewish world. At the center of many of these debates are ""Guide for the Perplexed"", ""13 Principles of Faith"", ""Mishnah Torah"", and his commentary on Anusim.

Yosef ben Yehuda of Ceuta 
Joseph ben Judah of Ceuta was the son of Rabbi Yehuda Ha-Kohen Ibn Soussan and a student of Maimonides for whom the Guide for the Perplexed is written. Yosef traveled from Alexandria to Fustat to study logic, mathematics, and astronomy under Maimonides. Philosophically, Yosef's dissertation, in Arabic, on the problem of ""Creation"" is suspected to have been written before contact with Maimonides. It is entitled Ma'amar bimehuyav ha-metsiut ve'eykhut sidur ha-devarim mimenu vehidush ha'olam (""A Treatise as to (1) Necessary Existence (2) The Procedure of Things from the Necessary Existence and (3) The Creation of the World"").

Jacob Anatoli 
Jacob Anatoli is generally regarded as a pioneer in the application of the Maimonidean Rationalism to the study of Jewish texts. He was the son-in-law of Samuel ibn Tibbon, translator of Maimonides. Due to these family ties Anatoli was introduced to the philosophy of Maimonides, the study of which was such a great revelation to him that he, in later days, referred to it as the beginning of his intelligent and true comprehension of the Scriptures, while he frequently alluded to Ibn Tibbon as one of the two masters who had instructed and inspired him. Anatoli wrote the Malmad exhibiting his broad knowledge of classic Jewish exegetes, as well as Plato, Aristotle, Averroes, and the Vulgate, as well as with a large number of Christian institutions, some of which he ventures to criticize, such as celibacy and monastic castigation, as well as certain heretics and he repeatedly appeals to his readers for a broader cultivation of the classic languages and the non-Jewish branches of learning. To Anatoli all men are, in truth, formed in the image of God, although the Jews stand under a particular obligation to further the true cognition of God simply by reason of their election, ""the Greeks had chosen wisdom as their pursuit; the Romans, power; and the Jews, religiousness""

Hillel ben Samuel 
Firstly, Hillel ben Samuel's importance in the history of medieval Jewish philosophy lies in his attempt to deal, systematically, with the question of the immortality of the soul. Secondly, Hillel played a major role in the controversies of 1289–90 concerning the philosophical works of Maimonides. Thirdly, Hillel was the first devotee of Jewish learning and Philosophy in Italy, bringing a close to a period of relative ignorance of Hakira in Verona (Italy). And finally, Hillel is one of the early Latin translators of ""the wise men of the nations"" (non-Jewish scholars).

Defending Maimonides, Hillel addressed a letter to his friend Maestro Gaio asking him to use his influence with the Jews of Rome against Maimonides' opponents (Solomon Petit). He also advanced the bold idea of gathering together Maimonides' defenders and opponents in Alexandria, in order to bring the controversy before a court of Babylonian rabbis, whose decision would be binding on both factions. Hillel was certain the verdict would favor Maimonides.

Hillel wrote a commentary on the 25 propositions appearing at the beginning of the second part of the Guide of the Perplexed, and three philosophical treatises, which were appended to Tagmulei ha-Nefesh: the first on knowledge and free will; the second on the question of why mortality resulted from the sin of Adam; the third on whether or not the belief in the fallen angels is a true belief.

Shemtob Ben Joseph Ibn Falaquera 

Shem-Tov ibn Falaquera was a Spanish-born philosopher who pursued reconciliation between Jewish dogma and philosophy.  Scholars speculate he was a student of Rabbi David Kimhi whose family fled Spain to Narbonne. Ibn Falaquera lived an ascetic live of solitude. Ibn Falaquera's two leading philosophic authorities were Averroes and Maimonides. Ibn Falaquera defended the ""Guide for the Perplexed"" against attacks of anti-Maimonideans. He knew the works of the Islamic philosophers better than any Jewish scholar of his time, and made many of them available to other Jewish scholars – often without attribution (Reshit Hokhmah). Ibn Falaquera did not hesitate to modify Islamic philosophic texts when it suited his purposes. For example, Ibn Falaquera turned Alfarabi's account of the origin of philosophic religion into a discussion of the origin of the ""virtuous city"". Ibn Falaquera's other works include, but are not limited to Iggeret Hanhagat ha-Guf we ha-Nefesh, a treatise in verse on the control of the body and the soul.

 Iggeret ha-Wikkuaḥ, a dialogue between a religious Jew and a Jewish philosopher on the harmony of philosophy and religion.
 Reshit Ḥokmah, treating of moral duties, of the sciences, and of the necessity of studying philosophy.
 Sefer ha-Ma'alot, on different degrees of human perfection.
 Moreh ha-Moreh, commentary on the philosophical part of Maimonides' ""Guide for the Perplexed"".

Joseph ben Abba Mari ibn Kaspi 
Ibn Kaspi was a fierce advocate of Maimonides to such an extent that he left for Egypt in 1314 in order to hear explanations on the latter's Guide of the Perplexed from Maimonides' grandchildren. When he heard that the Guide of the Perplexed was being studied in the Muslim philosophical schools of Fez, he left for that town (in 1332) in order to observe their method of study.

Ibn Kaspi began writing when he was 17 years old on topics which included logic, linguistics, ethics, theology, biblical exegesis, and super-commentaries to Abraham Ibn Ezra and Maimonides. Philosophic systems he followed were Aristotle's and Averroes'. He defines his aim as ""not to be a fool who believes in everything, but only in that which can be verified by proof...and not to be of the second unthinking category which disbelieves from the start of its inquiry,"" since ""certain things must be accepted by tradition, because they cannot be proven."" Scholars continue to debate whether ibn Kaspi was a heretic or one of Judaisms most illustrious scholars.

Gersonides 

Rabbi Levi ben Gershon was a student of his father Gerson ben Solomon of Arles, who in turn was a student of Shem-Tov ibn Falaquera.  Gersonides is best known for his work Milhamot HaShem (""Wars of the Lord"").  Milhamot HaShem is modelled after the ""Guide for the Perplexed"".  Gersonides and his father were avid students of the works of Alexander of Aphrodisias, Aristotle, Empedocles, Galen, Hippocrates, Homer, Plato, Ptolemy, Pythagoras, Themistius, Theophrastus, Ali ibn Abbas al-Magusi, Ali ibn Ridwan, Averroes, Avicenna, Qusta ibn Luqa, Al-Farabi, Al-Fergani, Chonain, Isaac Israeli, Ibn Tufail, Ibn Zuhr, Isaac Alfasi, and Maimonides. Gersonides held that God does not have complete foreknowledge of human acts. ""Gersonides, bothered by the old question of how God's foreknowledge is compatible with human freedom, suggests that what God knows beforehand is all the choices open to each individual. God does not know, however, which choice the individual, in his freedom, will make.""

Moses Narboni 
Moses ben Joshua composed commentaries on Islamic philosophical works. As an admirer of Averroes, he devoted a great deal of study to his works and wrote commentaries on a number of them. His best-known work is his Shelemut ha-Nefesh (""Treatise on the Perfection of the Soul""). Moses began studying philosophy with his father when he was thirteen later studying with Moses ben David Caslari and Abraham ben David Caslari - both of whom were students of Kalonymus ben Kalonymus. Moses believed that Judaism was a guide to the highest degree of theoretical and moral truth. He believed that the Torah had both a simple, direct meaning accessible to the average reader as well as a deeper, metaphysical meaning accessible to thinkers. Moses rejected the belief in miracles, instead believing they could be explained, and defended man's free will by philosophical arguments.

Isaac ben Sheshet Perfet 

Isaac ben Sheshet Perfet, of Barcelona, studied under Hasdai Crescas and Rabbi Nissim ben Reuben Gerondi.  Nissim ben Reuben Gerondi was a steadfast Rationalist who did not hesitate to refute leading authorities, such as Rashi, Rabbeinu Tam, Moses ben Nahman, and Solomon ben Adret.  The pogroms of 1391, against Jews of Spain, forced Isaac to flee to Algiers - where he lived out his life. Isaac's responsa evidence a profound knowledge of the philosophical writings of his time; in one of Responsa No. 118 he explains the difference between the opinion of Gersonides and that of Abraham ben David of Posquières on free will, and gives his own views on the subject. He was an adversary of Kabbalah who never spoke of the Sefirot; he quotes another philosopher when reproaching kabbalists with ""believing in the ""Ten"" (Sefirot) as the Christians believe in the Trinity"".

Hasdai ben Abraham Crescas 

Hasdai Crescas, of Barcelona, was a leading rationalist on issues of natural law and free-will. His views  can be seen as precursors to Baruch Spinoza's. His work, Or Adonai, became a classic refutation of medieval Aristotelianism, and harbinger of the scientific revolution in the 16th century. Hasdai Crescas was a student of Nissim ben Reuben Gerondi, who in turn was a student of Reuben ben Nissim Gerondi. Crescas was a rabbi and the head of the Jewish community of Aragon, and in some ways of all Hispanic Jewry, during one of its most critical periods. Among his fellow students and friends, his best friend was Isaac ben Sheshet Perfet.  Crescas' students won accolades as participants in the Disputation of Tortosa.

Simeon ben Zemah Duran 
Influenced by the teaching of Rabbi Nissim of Gerona, via Ephraim Vidal's Yeshiva in Majorca, Duran's commentary Magen Avot (""The Shield of the Fathers""), which influenced Joseph Albo, is important.  He was also a student of philosophy, astronomy, mathematics, and especially of medicine, which he practiced for a number of years at Palma, in Majorca. Magen Avot deals with concepts such as the nature of God, the eternity of the Torah, the coming of the Messiah, and the Resurrection of the dead. Duran believed that Judaism has three dogmas only: the existence of God, the Torah's Divine origin, and Reward and Punishment; in this regard he was followed by Joseph Albo.

Joseph Albo 
Joseph Albo, of Monreal, was a student of Hasdai Crescas.  He wrote Sefer ha-Ikkarim (""Book of Principles""), a classic work on the fundamentals of Judaism.  Albo narrows the fundamental Jewish principles of faith from thirteen to three -
 belief in the existence of God,
 belief in revelation, and
 belief in divine justice, as related to the idea of immortality.
Albo rejects the assumption that creation ex nihilo is essential in belief in God. Albo freely criticizes Maimonides' thirteen principles of belief and Crescas' six principles. According to Albo, ""belief in the Messiah is only a 'twig' unnecessary to the soundness of the trunk""; not essential to Judaism. Nor is it true, according to Albo, that every law is binding. Although every ordinance has the power of conferring happiness in its observance, it is not true that every law must be observed, or that through the neglect of a part of the law, a Jew would violate the divine covenant or be damned. Contemporary Orthodox Jews, however, vehemently disagree with Albo's position believing that all Jews are divinely obligated to fulfill every applicable commandment.

Hoter ben Solomon 

Hoter ben Shlomo was a scholar and philosopher in Yemen heavily influenced by Nethanel ben al-Fayyumi, Maimonides, Saadia Gaon and al-Ghazali. The connection between the ""Epistle of the Brethren of Purity"" and Ismailism suggests the adoption of this work as one of the main sources of what would become known as ""Jewish Ismailism"" as found in Late Medieval Yemenite Judaism. ""Jewish Ismailism"" consisted of adapting, to Judaism, a few Ismaili doctrines about cosmology, prophecy, and hermeneutics. There are many examples of the Brethren of Purity influencing Yemenite Jewish philosophers and authors in the period 1150–1550. Some traces of Brethren of Purity doctrines, as well as of their numerology, are found in two Yemenite philosophical midrashim written in 1420–1430: Midrash ha-hefez (""The Glad Learning"") by Zerahyah ha-Rofé (a/k/a Yahya al-Tabib) and the Siraj al-'uqul (""Lamp of Intellects"") by Hoter ben Solomon.

Don Isaac Abravanel 

Isaac Abravanel, statesman, philosopher, Bible commentator, and financier who commented on Maimonides' thirteen principles in his Rosh Amanah. Isaac Abravanel was steeped in Rationalism by the Ibn Yahya family, who had a residence immediately adjacent to the Great Synagogue of Lisbon (also built by the Ibn Yahya Family). His most important work, Rosh Amanah (""The Pinnacle of Faith""), defends Maimonides' thirteen articles of belief against attacks of Hasdai Crescas and Yosef Albo. Rosh Amanah ends with the statement that ""Maimonides compiled these articles merely in accordance with the fashion of other nations, which set up axioms or fundamental principles for their science"".

Isaac Abravanel was born and raised in Lisbon; a student of the Rabbi of Lisbon, Yosef ben Shlomo Ibn Yahya.  Rabbi Yosef was a poet, religious scholar, rebuilder of Ibn Yahya Synagogue of Calatayud, well versed in rabbinic literature and in the learning of his time, devoting his early years to the study of Jewish philosophy.  The Ibn Yahya family were renowned physicians, philosophers and accomplished aides to the Portuguese Monarchy for centuries.

Isaac's grandfather, Samuel Abravanel, was forcibly converted to Christianity during the pogroms of 1391 and took the Spanish name ""Juan Sanchez de Sevilla"". Samuel fled Castile-León, Spain, in 1397 for Lisbon, Portugal, and reverted to Judaism - shedding his Converso after living among Christians for six years. Conversions outside Judaism, coerced or otherwise, had a strong impact upon young Isaac, later compelling him to forfeit his immense wealth in an attempt to redeem Iberian Jewry from coercion of the Alhambra Decree. There are parallels between what he writes, and documents produced by Inquisitors, that present conversos as ambivalent to Christianity and sometimes even ironic in their expressions regarding their new religion - crypto-jews.

Leone Ebreo 
Judah Leon Abravanel was a Portuguese physician, poet and philosopher. His work Dialoghi d'amore (""Dialogues of Love""), written in Italian, was one of the most important philosophical works of his time. In an attempt to circumvent a plot, hatched by local Catholic Bishops to kidnap his son, Judah sent his son from Castile, to Portugal with a nurse, but by order of the king, the son was seized and baptized. This was a devastating insult to Judah and his family, and was a source of bitterness throughout Judah's life and the topic of his writings years later; especially since this was not the first time the Abravanel Family was subjected to such embarrassment at the hands of the Catholic Church.

Judah's Dialoghi is regarded as the finest of Humanistic Period works. His neoplatonism is derived from the Hispanic Jewish community, especially the works of Ibn Gabirol. Platonic notions of reaching towards a nearly impossible ideal of beauty, wisdom, and perfection encompass the whole of his work. In Dialoghi d'amore, Judah defines love in philosophical terms. He structures his three dialogues as a conversation between two abstract ""characters"": Philo, representing love or appetite, and Sophia, representing science or wisdom, Philo+Sophia (philosophia).

Criticisms of Kabbalah 
The word ""Kabbalah"" was used in medieval Jewish texts to mean ""tradition"", see Abraham Ibn Daud's Sefer Ha-Qabbalah also known as the ""Book of our Tradition"". ""Book of our Tradition"" does not refer to mysticism of any kind - it chronicles ""our tradition of scholarship and study"" in two Babylonian Academies, through the Geonim, into Talmudic Yeshivas of Spain. In Talmudic times there was a mystic tradition in Judaism, known as Maaseh Bereshith (the work of creation) and Maaseh Merkavah (the work of the chariot); Maimonides interprets these texts as referring to Aristotelian physics and metaphysics as interpreted in the light of Torah.

In the 13th century, however, a mystical-esoteric system emerged which became known as ""the Kabbalah"".  Many of the beliefs associated with Kabbalah had long been rejected by philosophers. Saadia Gaon had taught in his book Emunot v'Deot that Jews who believe in gilgul have adopted a non-Jewish belief. Maimonides rejected many texts of Heichalot, particularly Shi'ur Qomah whose anthropomorphic vision of God he considered heretical.

In the 13th century, Meir ben Simon of Narbonne wrote an epistle (included in Milhhemet Mitzvah) against early Kabbalists, singled out Sefer Bahir, rejecting the attribution of its authorship to the tanna R. Nehhunya ben ha-Kanah and describing some of its content:

Renaissance Jewish philosophy and philosophers 

Some of the Monarchies of Asia Minor and European welcomed expelled Jewish Merchants, scholars and theologians.  Divergent Jewish philosophies evolved against the backdrop of new cultures, new languages and renewed theological exchange. Philosophic  exploration continued through the Renaissance period as the center-of-mass of Jewish Scholarship shifted to France, Germany, Italy, and Turkey.

Elias ben Moise del Medigo 
Elia del Medigo was a descendant of Judah ben Eliezer ha-Levi Minz and Moses ben Isaac ha-Levi Minz.  Eli'ezer del Medigo, of Rome, received the surname ""Del Medigo"" after studying medicine.  The name was later changed from Del Medigo to Ha-rofeh. He was the father and teacher of a long line of rationalist philosophers and scholars.  Non-Jewish students of Delmedigo classified him as an ""Averroist"", however, he saw himself as a follower of Maimonides. Scholastic association of Maimonides and Ibn Rushd would have been a natural one; Maimonides, towards the end of his life, was impressed with the Ibn Rushd commentaries and recommended them to his students. The followers of Maimonides (Maimonideans) had therefore been, for several generations before Delmedigo, the leading users, translators and disseminators of the works of Ibn Rushd in Jewish circles, and advocates for Ibn Rushd even after Islamic rejection of his radical views. Maimonideans regarded Maimonides and Ibn Rushd as following the same general line.  In his book, Delmedigo portrays himself as defender of Maimonidean Judaism, and — like many Maimonideans — he emphasized the rationality of Jewish tradition.

Moses Almosnino 
Moses Almosnino was born Thessaloniki 1515 - died Constantinople abt 1580. He was a student of Levi Ibn Habib, who was in turn a student of Jacob ibn Habib, who was, in turn, a student of Nissim ben Reuben. In 1570 he wrote a commentary on the Pentateuch titled ""Yede Mosheh"" (The Hands of Moses); also an exposition of the Talmudical treatise ""Abot"" (Ethics of the Fathers), published in Salonica in 1563; and a collection of sermons delivered upon various occasions, particularly funeral orations, entitled ""Meammeẓ Koaḥ"" (Re-enforcing Strength).

al-Ghazâlî's Intentions of the Philosophers (De'ôt ha-Fîlôsôfîm or Kavvanôt ha-Fîlôsôfîm) was one of the most widespread philosophical texts studied among Jews in Europe having been translated in 1292 by Isaac Albalag.  Later Hebrew commentators include Moses Narboni, and Moses Almosnino.

Moses ben Jehiel Ha-Kohen Porto-Rafa (Rapaport) 
Moses ben Jehiel Ha-Kohen Porto-Rafa (Rapaport), was a member of the German family ""Rafa"" (from whom the Delmedigo family originates) that settled in the town of Porto in the vicinity of Verona, Italy, and became the progenitors of the renowned Rapaport rabbinic family. In 1602 Moses served as rabbi of Badia Polesine in Piedmont. Moses was a friend of Leon Modena.

Abraham ben Judah ha-Levi Minz 
Abraham ben Judah ha-Levi Minz was an Italian rabbi who flourished at Padua in the first half of the 16th century, father-in-law of Meïr Katzenellenbogen. Minz studied chiefly under his father, Judah Minz, whom he succeeded as rabbi and head of the yeshiva of Padua.

Meir ben Isaac Katzellenbogen 

Meir ben Isaac Katzellenbogen was born in Prague where together with Shalom Shachna he studied under Jacob Pollak. Many rabbis, including Moses Isserles, addressed him in their responsa as the ""av bet din of the republic of Venice."" The great scholars of the Renaissance with whom he corresponded include Shmuel ben Moshe di Modena, Joseph Katz, Solomon Luria, Moses Isserles, Obadiah Sforno, and Moses Alashkar.

Elijah Ba'al Shem of Chelm 
Rabbi Elijah Ba'al Shem of Chelm was a student of Rabbi Solomon Luria who was, in turn a student of Rabbi Shalom Shachna - father-in-law and teacher of Moses Isserles. Elijah Ba'al Shem of Chelm was also a cousin of Moses Isserles.

Seventeenth-century Jewish philosophy 

With expulsion from Spain came the dissemination of Jewish philosophical investigation throughout the Mediterranean Basin, Northern Europe and the Western Hemisphere. The center-of-mass of Rationalism shifted to France, Italy, Germany, Crete, Sicily and Netherlands.  Expulsion from Spain and the coordinated pogroms of Europe resulted in the cross-pollination of variations on Rationalism incubated within diverse communities.  This period is also marked by the intellectual exchange among leaders of the Christian Reformation and Jewish scholars.  Of particular note is the line of Rationalists who migrated out of Germany, and present-day Italy into Crete, and other areas of the Ottoman Empire seeking safety and protection from the endless pogroms fomented by the House of Habsburg and the Roman Catholic Church against Jews.

Rationalism was incubating in places far from Spain. From stories told by Rabbi Elijah Ba'al Shem of Chelm, German-speaking Jews, descendants of Jews who migrated back to Jerusalem after Charlemagne's invitation was revoked in Germany many centuries earlier, who lived in Jerusalem during the 11th century, were influenced by prevailing Mutazilite scholars of Jerusalem. A German-speaking Palestinian Jew saved the life of a young German man surnamed ""Dolberger"". When the knights of the First Crusade came to besiege Jerusalem, one of Dolberger's family members rescued German-speaking Jews in Palestine and brought them back to the safety of Worms, Germany, to repay the favor. Further evidence of German communities in the holy city comes in the form of halakic questions sent from Germany to Jerusalem during the second half of the eleventh century.

All of the foregoing resulted in an explosion of new ideas and philosophic paths.

Yosef Shlomo ben Eliyahu Dal Medigo 
Joseph Solomon Delmedigo was  a physician and teacher – Baruch Spinoza was a student of his works.

Baruch Spinoza 

Baruch Spinoza founded Spinozism, broke with Rabbinic Jewish tradition, and was placed in herem by the Beit Din of Amsterdam. The influence in his work from Maimonides and Leone Ebreo is evident. Elia del Medigo claims to be a student of the works of Spinoza. Some contemporary critics (e.g., Wachter, Der Spinozismus im Judenthum) claimed to detect the influence of the Kabbalah, while others (e.g., Leibniz) regarded Spinozism as a revival of Averroism – a talmudist manner of referencing to Maimonidean Rationalism. In the centuries that have lapsed since the herem declaration, scholars have re-examined the works of Spinoza and find them to reflect a body of work and thinking that is not unlike some contemporary streams of Judaism. For instance, while Spinoza was accused of pantheism, scholars have come to view his work as advocating panentheism, a valid contemporary view easily accommodated by contemporary Judaism.

Tzvi Hirsch ben Yaakov Ashkenazi 
Rabbi Tzvi Hirsch ben Yaakov Ashkenazi was a student of his father, but most notably also a student of his grandfather Rabbi Elijah Ba'al Shem of Chelm.

Jacob Emden 
Rabbi Jacob Emden was a student of his father Rabbi Tzvi Hirsch ben Yaakov Ashkenazi a rabbi in Amsterdam. Emden, a steadfast Talmudist, was a prominent opponent of the Sabbateans (Messianic Kabbalists who followed Sabbatai Tzvi). Although anti-Maimonidean, Emden should be noted for his critical examination of the Zohar concluding that large parts of it were forged.

Philosophical criticisms of Kabbalah 

Rabbi Leone di Modena wrote that if we were to accept the Kabbalah, then the Christian trinity would indeed be compatible with Judaism, as the Trinity closely resembles the Kabbalistic doctrine of the Sefirot.

Eighteenth and nineteenth-century Jewish philosophy 

A new era began in the 18th century with the thought of Moses Mendelssohn. Mendelssohn has been described as the ""'third Moses,' with whom begins a new era in Judaism,"" just as new eras began with Moses the prophet and with Moses Maimonides.  Mendelssohn was a German Jewish philosopher to whose ideas the renaissance of European Jews, Haskalah (the Jewish Enlightenment) is indebted. He has been referred to as the father of Reform Judaism, although Reform spokesmen have been ""resistant to claim him as their spiritual father"". Mendelssohn came to be regarded as a leading cultural figure of his time by both Germans and Jews. His most significant book was Jerusalem oder über religiöse Macht und Judentum (Jerusalem), first published in 1783.

Alongside Mendelssohn, other important Jewish philosophers of the eighteenth century included:
 Menachem Mendel Lefin, anti-Hasidic Haskalah philosopher
 Salomon Maimon, Enlightenment philosopher
 Isaac Satanow, a Haskalah philosopher
 Naphtali Ullman, Haskalah philosopher

Important Jewish philosophers of the nineteenth century included:
 Elijah Benamozegh, a Sephardic rabbi and philosopher
 Hermann Cohen, a neo-Kantian Jewish philosopher
 Moses Hess, a secular Jewish philosopher and one of the founders of socialism
 Samson Raphael Hirsch, leader of the Torah im Derech Eretz school of 19th century neo-Orthodoxy
 Samuel Hirsch, a leader of Reform Judaism
 Nachman Krochmal, Haskalah philosopher in Galicia
 Samuel David Luzzatto a Sephardic rabbi and philosopher
 Karl Marx, German economist and Jewish philosopher.

Traditionalist attitudes towards philosophy 

Haredi traditionalists who emerged in reaction to the Haskalah considered the fusion of religion and philosophy as difficult because classical philosophers start with no preconditions for which conclusions they must reach in their investigation, while classical religious believers have a set of religious principles of faith that they hold one must believe. Most Haredim contended that one cannot simultaneously be a philosopher and a true adherent of a revealed religion. In this view, all attempts at synthesis ultimately fail. Rabbi Nachman of Breslov, for example, viewed all philosophy as untrue and heretical.  In this he represents one strand of Hasidic thought, with creative emphasis on the emotions.

Other exponents of Hasidism had a more positive attitude towards philosophy. In the Chabad writings of Schneur Zalman of Liadi, Hasidut is seen as able to unite all parts of Torah thought, from the schools of philosophy to mysticism, by uncovering the illuminating Divine essence that permeates and transcends all approaches. Interpreting the verse from Job, ""from my flesh I see HaShem"", Shneur Zalman explained the inner meaning, or ""soul"", of the Jewish mystical tradition in intellectual form, by means of analogies drawn from the human realm. As explained and continued by the later leaders of Chabad, this enabled the human mind to grasp concepts of Godliness, and so enable the heart to feel the love and awe of God, emphasised by all the founders of hasidism, in an internal way. This development, the culminating level of the Jewish mystical tradition, in this way bridges philosophy and mysticism, by expressing the transcendent in human terms.

20th and 21st-century Jewish philosophy

Jewish existentialism 

One of the major trends in modern Jewish philosophy was the attempt to develop a theory of Judaism through existentialism. Among the early Jewish existentialist philosophers was Lev Shestov (Jehuda Leib Schwarzmann), a Russian-Jewish philosopher. One of the most influential Jewish existentialists in the first half of the 20th century was Franz Rosenzweig. While researching his doctoral dissertation on the 19th-century German philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Rosenzweig reacted against Hegel's idealism and developed an existential approach.  Rosenzweig, for a time, considered conversion to Christianity, but in 1913, he turned to Jewish philosophy. He became a philosopher and student of Hermann Cohen. Rosenzweig's major work, Star of Redemption, is his new philosophy in which he portrays the relationships between haShem, humanity and world as they are connected by creation, revelation and redemption. Orthodox rabbi Joseph Soloveitchik, and Conservative rabbis Neil Gillman and Elliot N. Dorff have also been described as existentialists.

The French philosopher and Talmudic commentator Emmanuel Levinas, whose approach grew out of the phenomenological tradition in philosophy, has also been described as a Jewish existentialist.

Jewish rationalism 

Rationalism has re-emerged as a popular perspective among Jews.  Contemporary Jewish rationalism often draws on ideas associated with medieval philosophers such as Maimonides and modern Jewish rationalists such as Hermann Cohen.

Cohen was a German Jewish neo-Kantian philosopher who turned to Jewish subjects at the end of his career in the early 20th century, picking up on ideas of Maimonides. In America, Steven Schwarzschild continued Cohen's legacy. Another prominent contemporary Jewish rationalist is Lenn Goodman, who works out of the traditions of medieval Jewish rationalist philosophy.  Conservative rabbis Alan Mittleman of the Jewish Theological Seminary and Elliot N. Dorff of American Jewish University also see themselves in the rationalist tradition, as does David Novak of the University of Toronto.  Novak works in the natural law tradition, which is one version of rationalism.

Philosophers in modern-day Israel in the rationalist tradition include David Hartman and Moshe Halbertal.

Some Orthodox rationalists in Israel take a ""restorationist"" approach, reaching back in time for tools to simplify Rabbinic Judaism and bring all Jews, regardless of status or stream of Judaism, closer to observance of Halacha, Mitzvot, Kashrut and embrace of Maimonides' ""13 Principles of Faith"".  Dor Daim, and Rambamists are two groups who reject mysticism as a ""superstitious innovation"" to an otherwise clear and succinct set of Laws and rules. According to these rationalists, there is shame and disgrace attached to failure to investigate matters of religious principle using the fullest powers of human reason and intellect.  One cannot be considered wise, or perceptive, if one does not attempt to understand the origins, and establish the correctness, of one's beliefs.

Holocaust theology 

Judaism has traditionally taught that God is omnipotent, omniscient and omnibenevolent. Yet, these claims are in jarring contrast with the fact that there is much evil in the world. Perhaps the most difficult question that monotheists have confronted is ""how can one reconcile the existence of this view of God with the existence of evil?"" or ""how can there be good without bad?""  ""how can there be a God without a devil?"" This is the problem of evil.  Within all monotheistic faiths many answers (theodicies) have been proposed.  However, in light of the magnitude of evil seen in the Holocaust, many people have re-examined classical views on this subject. How can people still have any kind of faith after the Holocaust?  This set of Jewish philosophies is discussed in the article on Holocaust theology.

Reconstructionist theology 

Perhaps the most controversial form of Jewish philosophy that developed in the early 20th century was the religious naturalism of Rabbi Mordecai Kaplan.  His theology was a variant of John Dewey's pragmatist philosophy.  Dewey's naturalism combined atheist beliefs with religious terminology in order to construct a philosophy for those who had lost faith in traditional Judaism.  In agreement with the classical medieval Jewish thinkers, Kaplan affirmed that haShem is not personal, and that all anthropomorphic descriptions of haShem are, at best, imperfect metaphors.  Kaplan's theology went beyond this to claim that haShem is the sum of all natural processes that allow man to become self-fulfilled.  Kaplan wrote that ""to believe in haShem means to take for granted that it is man's destiny to rise above the brute and to eliminate all forms of violence and exploitation from human society.""

Process theology 
A recent trend has been to reframe Jewish theology through the lens of process philosophy, more specifically process theology. Process philosophy suggests that fundamental elements of the universe are occasions of experience.  According to this notion, what people commonly think of as concrete objects are actually successions of these occasions of experience. Occasions of experience can be collected into groupings; something complex such as a human being is thus a grouping of many smaller occasions of experience. In this view, everything in the universe is characterized by experience (not to be confused with consciousness); there is no mind-body duality under this system, because ""mind"" is simply seen as a very developed kind of experiencing entity.

Intrinsic to this worldview is the notion that all experiences are influenced by prior experiences, and will influence all future experiences.  This process of influencing is never deterministic; an occasion of experience consists of a process of comprehending other experiences, and then reacting to it.  This is the ""process"" in ""process philosophy"". Process philosophy gives God a special place in the universe of occasions of experience. God encompasses all the other occasions of experience but also transcends them; thus process philosophy is a form of panentheism.

The original ideas of process theology were developed by Charles Hartshorne (1897–2000), and influenced a number of Jewish theologians, including British philosopher Samuel Alexander (1859–1938), and Rabbis Max Kadushin, Milton Steinberg and Levi A. Olan, Harry Slominsky, and Bradley Shavit Artson.  Abraham Joshua Heschel has also been linked to this tradition.

Kabbalah and philosophy 
Kabbalah continued to be central to Haredi Orthodox Judaism, which generally rejected philosophy, although the Chabad strain of Chasidism showed a more positive attitude towards philosophy. Meanwhile, non-Orthodox Jewish thought in the latter 20th century saw resurgent interest in Kabbalah. In academic studies, Gershom Scholem began the critical investigation of Jewish mysticism, while in non-Orthodox Jewish denominations, Jewish Renewal and Neo-Hasidism, spiritualised worship. Many philosophers do not consider this a form of philosophy, as Kabbalah is a collection of esoteric methods of textual interpretation. Mysticism is generally understood as an alternative to philosophy, not a variant of philosophy.

Among the modern critics of Kabbalah was Yihhyah Qafahh, who wrote a book entitled Milhamoth ha-Shem, (Wars of the Name) against what he perceived as the false teachings of the Zohar and the false Kabbalah of Isaac Luria. He is credited with spearheading the Dor Daim. Yeshayahu Leibowitz publicly shared the views expressed in Rabbi Yihhyah Qafahh's book Milhhamoth ha-Shem and elaborated upon these views in his many writings.

2085,"[""Weather the 's How , album one released group the , 1973 In ?""]","Benjamin Orzechowski (September 8, 1947 – October 3, 2000), known professionally as Benjamin  Orr, was an American musician and singer best known as the bassist, co-founder, and co-lead vocalist of the rock band the Cars. He sang lead vocals on several of their best known songs, including ""Just What I Needed"", ""Let's Go"" and ""Drive"". He also had a moderate solo hit with ""Stay the Night"".

Orr was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Cars in 2018.

Life and career 
Benjamin Orzechowski was born in Lakewood, Ohio, to parents of Polish, Russian, Czechoslovak and German descent. His family actively supported his musical endeavors. He became proficient in several instruments including the guitar, bass guitar, keyboards, and drums.

Known locally as ""Benny 11 Letters"", he grew up in Lakewood, Ohio, and Parma, Ohio and attended Valley Forge High School before joining local band the Grasshoppers as lead singer and guitarist in 1964. In 1965, the Grasshoppers released two singles on the Sunburst label: ""Mod Socks"" and ""Pink Champagne (and Red Roses)"", the latter written by Orzechowski.

The Grasshoppers were also the house band on the Big 5 Show, a musical variety television show produced by WEWS-TV in Cleveland.  The Grasshoppers dissolved in 1966, when two of the band members were drafted into the U.S. Army, after which Orzechowski joined the band Mixed Emotions, and later the Colours.

Later, Orzechowski was drafted as well, although he received a deferment after approximately a year and a half in the Army.

Orr first met Ric Ocasek in Cleveland in the 1960s after Ocasek saw Orr performing with the Grasshoppers on the Big 5 Show. A few years later, Orr moved to Columbus, Ohio, where he and Ocasek formed a musical partnership that would continue in various incarnations, until the break up of the Cars in 1988. After moving to Boston, the two formed a folk band called Milkwood with guitarist James Goodkind.

In 1973, the group released one album, How's the Weather? which failed to chart. Remaining in Boston, Ocasek and Orr then formed another band, Richard and the Rabbits, featuring keyboardist Greg Hawkes, followed by another band, Cap'n Swing, which included guitarist Elliot Easton. After the group broke up in 1976, the four of them and drummer David Robinson formed the Cars.

As a member of the Cars, Orr sang lead vocal on some of the band's best known songs, including their first hit in the Top 40, ""Just What I Needed"", ""Let's Go,"" and ""Drive"", their highest charting single in the United States.

Orr released his only solo album, The Lace, in 1986. He co-wrote the music and lyrics with his longtime girlfriend, Diane Grey Page, who also sang backing vocals and appeared on the album's back cover. The album featured a Top 40 pop hit, ""Stay the Night"". The song was also a Top 10 album rock hit. An accompanying music video for the song was in heavy rotation on MTV.

A second single, ""Too Hot to Stop"", was also released, but did not chart in the Billboard Hot 100, though it reached No. 25 on the album rock chart. Orr continued to work with the Cars for one more album, Door to Door, and tour before the group disbanded in 1988, after which he and the other members pursued solo work. Sometime in the mid 1990s, Orr recorded tracks with guitarist John Kalishes for an unreleased follow up to The Lace.

From 1998 until his death in 2000, he performed with his own band ORR and two side bands, Voices of Classic Rock with Mickey Thomas and John Cafferty,
and cover band Big People, with Pat Travers (of the Pat Travers Band), Jeff Carlisi (of 38 Special), Derek St. Holmes (of Ted Nugent), and Liberty DeVitto (of Billy Joel).

Orr was married twice and had one son.

Illness and death 
In April 2000, Orr was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and hospitalized. However, he continued to perform with the band Big People throughout that summer at music festivals and state fairs. He reunited with the Cars one last time in Atlanta, for an interview that was included in the Rhino Records concert video The Cars Live.

Orr died of pancreatic cancer at his home in Atlanta on October 3, 2000, at the age of 53. He had made his final public appearance six days earlier, performing with Big People in Anchorage, Alaska; bandmates Jeff Carlisi, Derek St. Holmes and Rob Wilson were at Orr's bedside when he died.

Ric Ocasek wrote and recorded the song ""Silver"" as a musical tribute to Orr. It appeared on Ocasek's 2005 solo album, Nexterday. The Cars reunited ten years after Orr's death and released their seventh (and final) studio album, Move Like This, in May 2011. Orr was given special thanks in the liner notes: ""Ben, your spirit was with us on this one.""

2098,"['Daniel , are you what know You "" , him to said counselor camp a when , 11 age at camp summer attending while philosophy of notion the to introduced first was he that says Dennett ?']","Daniel Clement Dennett III (born March 28, 1942) is an American philosopher, writer, and cognitive scientist whose research centers on the philosophy of mind, philosophy of science, and philosophy of biology, particularly as those fields relate to evolutionary biology and cognitive science.

, he is the co-director of the Center for Cognitive Studies and the Austin B. Fletcher Professor of Philosophy at Tufts University. 
Dennett is a member of the editorial board for The Rutherford Journal and a co-founder of The Clergy Project.

A vocal atheist and secularist,  Dennett is referred to as one of the ""Four Horsemen of New Atheism"", along with Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris, and the late Christopher Hitchens.

Early life, education, and career
Daniel Clement Dennett III was born on March 28, 1942, in Boston, Massachusetts, the son of Ruth Marjorie (née Leck; 1903–1971) and Daniel Clement Dennett Jr (1910-1947). Dennett spent part of his childhood in Lebanon, where, during World War II, his father, who had a PhD in Islamic Studies from Harvard University, was a covert counter-intelligence agent with the Office of Strategic Services posing as a cultural attaché to the American Embassy in Beirut. His mother, an English major at Carleton College, went for a master's degree at the University of Minnesota before becoming an English teacher at the American Community School in Beirut. In 1947, his father was killed in a plane crash in Ethiopia. Shortly after, his mother took him back to Massachusetts. Dennett's sister is the investigative journalist Charlotte Dennett. Dennett says that he was first introduced to the notion of philosophy while attending summer camp at age 11, when a camp counselor said to him, ""You know what you are, Daniel? You're a philosopher.""

Dennett graduated from Phillips Exeter Academy in 1959, and spent one year at Wesleyan University before receiving his Bachelor of Arts in philosophy at Harvard University in 1963. At Harvard University he was a student of W. V. Quine. In 1965, he received his Doctor of Philosophy in philosophy at the University of Oxford, where he studied under Gilbert Ryle and was a member of Hertford College. His dissertation was entitled The Mind and the Brain: Introspective Description in the Light of Neurological Findings; Intentionality.

Dennett taught at the University of California, Irvine, from 1965 to 1971, before moving to Tufts University, where he settled in for many decades, aside from periods visiting at Harvard University and several other schools.

Dennett describes himself as ""an autodidact—or, more properly, the beneficiary of hundreds of hours of informal tutorials on all the fields that interest me, from some of the world's leading scientists"".

He is the recipient of a Fulbright Fellowship, two Guggenheim Fellowships, and a Fellowship at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences. He is a Fellow of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry and a Humanist Laureate of the International Academy of Humanism. He was named 2004 Humanist of the Year by the American Humanist Association. In 2006, Dennett received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

In February 2010, he was named to the Freedom From Religion Foundation's Honorary Board of distinguished achievers.

In 2012, he was awarded the Erasmus Prize, an annual award for a person who has made an exceptional contribution to European culture, society or social science, ""for his ability to translate the cultural significance of science and technology to a broad audience.""

In 2018, he was awarded an honorary degree by Radboud University, located in Nijmegen, Netherlands, for his contributions to and influence on cross-disciplinary science.

Philosophical views

Free will
While he is a confirmed compatibilist on free will, in ""On Giving Libertarians What They Say They Want""—chapter 15 of his 1978 book Brainstorms—Dennett articulated the case for a two-stage model of decision making in contrast to libertarian views.

While other philosophers have developed two-stage models, including William James, Henri Poincaré, Arthur Compton, and Henry Margenau, Dennett defends this model for the following reasons:

Leading libertarian philosophers such as Robert Kane have rejected Dennett's model, specifically that random chance is directly involved in a decision, on the basis that they believe this eliminates the agent's motives and reasons, character and values, and feelings and desires. They claim that, if chance is the primary cause of decisions, then agents cannot be liable for resultant actions. Kane says:

Philosophy of mind
Dennett has remarked in several places (such as ""Self-portrait"", in Brainchildren) that his overall philosophical project has remained largely the same since his time at Oxford. He is primarily concerned with providing a philosophy of mind that is grounded in empirical research. In his original dissertation, Content and Consciousness, he broke up the problem of explaining the mind into the need for a theory of content and for a theory of consciousness. His approach to this project has also stayed true to this distinction. Just as Content and Consciousness has a bipartite structure, he similarly divided Brainstorms into two sections. He would later collect several essays on content in The Intentional Stance and synthesize his views on consciousness into a unified theory in Consciousness Explained. These volumes respectively form the most extensive development of his views.

In chapter 5 of Consciousness Explained Dennett describes his multiple drafts model of consciousness. He states that, ""all varieties of perception—indeed all varieties of thought or mental activity—are accomplished in the brain by parallel, multitrack processes of interpretation and elaboration of sensory inputs. Information entering the nervous system is under continuous 'editorial revision.'"" (p. 111). Later he asserts, ""These yield, over the course of time, something rather like a narrative stream or sequence, which can be thought of as subject to continual editing by many processes distributed around the brain, ..."" (p. 135, emphasis in the original).

In this work, Dennett's interest in the ability of evolution to explain some of the content-producing features of consciousness is already apparent, and this has since become an integral part of his program. He states his view is materialist and scientific, and he presents an argument against qualia; he argues that the concept of qualia is so confused that it cannot be put to any use or understood in any non-contradictory way, and therefore does not constitute a valid refutation of physicalism.

However, this view is rejected by neuroscientists Gerald Edelman, Antonio Damasio, Vilayanur Ramachandran, Giulio Tononi, and Rodolfo Llinás, all of whom state that qualia exist and that the desire to eliminate them is based on an erroneous interpretation on the part of some philosophers regarding what constitutes science.

Dennett's strategy mirrors his teacher Ryle's approach of redefining first person phenomena in third person terms, and denying the coherence of the concepts which this approach struggles with.

Dennett self-identifies with a few terms:

In Consciousness Explained, he affirms ""I am a sort of 'teleofunctionalist', of course, perhaps the original teleofunctionalist"". He goes on to say, ""I am ready to come out of the closet as some sort of verificationist"" (pp. 460–61).

Evolutionary debate
Much of Dennett's work since the 1990s has been concerned with fleshing out his previous ideas by addressing the same topics from an evolutionary standpoint, from what distinguishes human minds from animal minds (Kinds of Minds), to how free will is compatible with a naturalist view of the world (Freedom Evolves).

Dennett sees evolution by natural selection as an algorithmic process (though he spells out that algorithms as simple as long division often incorporate a significant degree of randomness). This idea is in conflict with the evolutionary philosophy of paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould, who preferred to stress the ""pluralism"" of evolution (i.e., its dependence on many crucial factors, of which natural selection is only one).

Dennett's views on evolution are identified as being strongly adaptationist, in line with his theory of the intentional stance, and the evolutionary views of biologist Richard Dawkins. In Darwin's Dangerous Idea, Dennett showed himself even more willing than Dawkins to defend adaptationism in print, devoting an entire chapter to a criticism of the ideas of Gould. This stems from Gould's long-running public debate with E. O. Wilson and other evolutionary biologists over human sociobiology and its descendant evolutionary psychology, which Gould and Richard Lewontin opposed, but which Dennett advocated, together with Dawkins and Steven Pinker. Gould argued that Dennett overstated his claims and misrepresented Gould's, to reinforce what Gould describes as Dennett's ""Darwinian fundamentalism"".

Dennett's theories have had a significant influence on the work of evolutionary psychologist Geoffrey Miller.

An account of religion and morality
Dennett is a vocal atheist and secularist, a member of the Secular Coalition for America advisory board, and a member of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry, as well as an outspoken supporter of the Brights movement. Dennett is referred to as one of the ""Four Horsemen of New Atheism"", along with Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris, and the late Christopher Hitchens.

In Darwin's Dangerous Idea, Dennett writes that evolution can account for the origin of morality. He rejects, however, the idea that morality being natural to us implies that we should take a skeptical position regarding ethics, noting that what is fallacious in the naturalistic fallacy is not to support values per se, but rather to rush from facts to values.

In his 2006 book, Breaking the Spell: Religion as a Natural Phenomenon, Dennett attempts to account for religious belief naturalistically, explaining possible evolutionary reasons for the phenomenon of religious adherence.
In this book he declares himself to be ""a bright"", and defends the term.

He has been doing research into clerics who are secretly atheists and how they rationalize their works. He found what he called a ""don't ask, don't tell"" conspiracy because believers did not want to hear of loss of faith. That made unbelieving preachers feel isolated but they did not want to lose their jobs and sometimes their church-supplied lodgings and generally consoled themselves that they were doing good in their pastoral roles by providing comfort and required ritual. The research, with Linda LaScola, was further extended to include other denominations and non-Christian clerics. The research and stories Dennett and LaScola accumulated during this project were published in their 2013 co-authored book, Caught in the Pulpit: Leaving Belief Behind.

Other philosophical views
He has also written about and advocated the notion of memetics as a philosophically useful tool, most recently in his ""Brains, Computers, and Minds"", a three-part presentation through Harvard's MBB 2009 Distinguished Lecture Series.

Dennett has been critical of postmodernism, having said: Postmodernism, the school of ""thought"" that proclaimed ""There are no truths, only interpretations"" has largely played itself out in absurdity, but it has left behind a generation of academics in the humanities disabled by their distrust of the very idea of truth and their disrespect for evidence, settling for ""conversations"" in which nobody is wrong and nothing can be confirmed, only asserted with whatever style you can muster.

Dennett adopted and somewhat redefined the term ""deepity"", originally coined by Miriam Weizenbaum. Dennett used ""deepity"" for a statement that is apparently profound, but is actually trivial on one level and meaningless on another. Generally, a deepity has two (or more) meanings: one that is true but trivial, and another that sounds profound and would be important if true, but is actually false or meaningless. Examples are ""Que será será!"", ""Beauty is only skin deep!"", ""The power of intention can transform your life."" The term has been cited many times.

Artificial intelligence 
While approving of the increase in efficiency that humans reap by using resources such as expert systems in medicine or GPS in navigation, Dennett sees a danger in machines performing an ever-increasing proportion of basic tasks in perception, memory, and algorithmic computation because people may tend to anthropomorphize such systems and attribute intellectual powers to them that they do not possess. He believes the relevant danger from artificial intelligence (AI) is that people will misunderstand the nature of basically ""parasitic"" AI systems, rather than employing them constructively to challenge and develop the human user's powers of comprehension.

As given in his most recent book, From Bacteria to Bach and Back, Dennett's views are contrary to those of Nick Bostrom. Although acknowledging that it is ""possible in principle"" to create AI with human-like comprehension and agency, Dennett maintains that the difficulties of any such ""strong AI"" project would be orders of magnitude greater than those raising concerns have realized. According to Dennett, the prospect of superintelligence (AI massively exceeding the cognitive performance of humans in all domains) is at least 50 years away, and of far less pressing significance than other problems the world faces.

Personal life
Dennett married Susan Bell in 1962. They live in North Andover, Massachusetts, and have a daughter, a son, and five grandchildren.

Dennett is an avid sailor.

2141,['dead link 21.10 (    Guide Start Quick DejaGnu ?'],"DejaGnu is a software framework for testing other programs. It has a main script called runtest that goes through a directory looking at configuration files and then runs some tests with given criteria.  The purpose of the DejaGnu package is to provide a single front end for all tests. It is a part of the GNU Project and is licensed under the GPL. It is based on Expect, which is in turn based on Tcl. The current maintainers are Rob Savoye and Ben Elliston.

Testing
DejaGnu has a very strong history in testing due to its Tcl base. Tcl is used extensively by companies such as Oracle and Sybase to test their products. DejaGnu allows this work to be much more structured.

The tests can be grouped according to the tool they are testing. The test is run by merely calling  in the root project directory.
  runtest --tool program_to_test
This will look in the  directory for any folders starting with  and will run all .exp files in that folder.

Embedded design
One field for which DejaGnu is particularly well suited is that of embedded system design.  It allows for testing to be done remotely on development boards; separate initialization files can be created for each operating system and board. This mainly focuses on embedded targets and remote hosts. DejaGnu is thus popular with many GNU projects,  at universities, and for private companies.

Files
Essential Files

 Each directory in testsuite should contain tests for a specific tool. In this example, the tool being tested is the Apache webserver.
   This will be the file containing tests, which in this fictional case might change configuration options, and then connect to the network and check to make sure the changes have taken effect.

 This file will be run as a tool init file for the tool called toolname.

Other Files
  This file is a directory specific configuration file for .  Options can be placed in this file rather than retyped on each invocation; these options can include any variable passed as a command line argument.
 set tool Apache         #run tests on Apache
 set srcdir ./testsuite  #look here for test files
 set outdir ./logs       #save the logs in a separate directory
 set all 1               #show results from all tests (rather than just ones with errors)
   This is a personal configuration file, which should be located in the user's home directory ()
   This is the first configuration file loaded. It can be named anything but must be pointed to by the $DEJAGNU environment variable (set when your terminal loads).

2152,"['slur racial a not is this that white \'m I because it Is "" , responded Workman "" , papers his see to waiting still "" was she that responded Tidd When ?']","Ritch Workman (born May 3, 1973) is a former Republican member of the Florida House of Representatives, who represented the 52nd District, which includes southern Brevard County, stretching from Melbourne to Palm Shores, from 2012 to 2016, and previously representing the 30th District from 2008 to 2012.

History
Workman was born in Belleville, Ontario, in 1973. In 1980, his family moved from Canada to the U.S. state of Florida. Workman graduated from Satellite High School in Satellite Beach and then attended Appalachian State University, where he graduated in 1995. Following graduation, he served in the National Guard from 1990 to 2005, including as a Battery Commander in Operation Noble Eagle. When incumbent State Representative Mike Haridopolos was elected to the Florida Senate in a 2003 Special Election, Workman ran to succeed him in the 30th District, which stretched from Rockledge to Palm Bay in southern Brevard County. Workman lost to Thad Altman in the Republican primary, receiving 29% of the vote to Altman's 41%.

Florida House of Representatives
When Altman opted to run for the Florida Senate rather than seek re-election in 2008, Workman ran to succeed him. In the Republican primary, Workman faced Tres Holton, whom he easily defeated, winning 62% of the vote. He faced Amy Tidd, the Democratic nominee, and, following a contentious campaign, narrowly defeated her, winning 54% of the vote to Tidd's 46%. When running for re-election in 2010, Workman once again faced Tidd, and he campaigned on his sponsorship of legislation similar to SB 1070 in Arizona, which would allow police officers to ""detain a person who cannot prove their citizenship or legal status."" When Tidd responded that she was ""still waiting to see his papers,"" Workman responded, ""Is it because I'm white that this is not a racial slur? I'm offended, but she makes my point for me. I'm pro-immigration reform because when someone comes here illegally, it diminishes my struggle."" The Orlando Sentinel endorsed Tidd over Workman, criticizing Workman's ""dubious priorities,"" including ""aligning himself with a fringe group that rejects federal authority over states, though he sees no contradiction in Florida taking billions of dollars in stimulus money from Washington, D.C."" Despite this, Workman managed to expand his margin of victory over Tidd, defeating her in a landslide with 61% of the vote.

In 2012, when the state's legislative districts were reconfigured, Workman was moved into the 52nd District, which included most of the territory that he previously represented in the 30th District. He faced no opposition in the Republican primary or the general election, and won his third term entirely uncontested. Workman was re-elected to his fourth and final term in the House in 2014 without opposition.

Controversy
During the 2011 legislative session, Workman authored several pieces of legislation that would have repealed a number of what he considered to be ""inane"" laws. The most controversial of the laws he aimed to repeal was a statute banning the practice of ""dwarf-tossing,"" a ""competition in which little people are literally turned into human shot puts."" Workman asserted, ""[Little people] don't need government to decide for them. This is insulting. Their actions aren't endangering anyone else. For every law that's on the books a little piece of your liberty and freedom is lost."" He argued that his legislation could help improve the economy, noting, ""All that [the ban on dwarf-tossing] does is prevent some dwarfs from getting jobs they would be happy to get. In this economy, or any economy, why would we want to prevent people from getting gainful employment?"" Little People of America, an advocacy group for individuals with dwarfism, condemned Workman's legislation, and Jennifer Arnold, one of the stars of The Little Couple, argued against the proposal, saying, ""My biggest concern is that we're going backwards. It seems okay today to still make fun of little people. It's not okay to do that for races, religions and other disabled people.""

Resignation
After losing the 2016 primary election for the state senate, Workman was appointed to the Florida Public Service Commission by Republican Governor Rick Scott. Before he could assume office, Workman was accused of being vulgar by State Senator Lizbeth Benacquisto (R) who claimed he made vulgar comments and gestures at a charity event.  She asked him to stop, but he persisted. When he refused to stop, others had to intervene.

Senator Benacquisto announced she would not schedule Workman for confirmation by the Senate. Following Benacquisto's announcement, Workman contacted Scott and immediately withdrew from consideration. Workman apologized to Benacquisto and agreed to step aside from the PCS appointment to keep from becoming a distraction to the Governor.

2169,"['chick that get you Did "" : festival jazz Pasadena the at her hearing upon exclamation \'s Armstrong Louis quoted and "" diamond carat - 20 a as rare ... rich , pure is voice The "" : Dane of wrote Time ?', 'chick that get you Did "" : readers magazine Time asked had Armstrong Louis , 1959 By ?']","Barbara Dane (born Barbara Jean Spillman; May 12, 1927) is an American folk, blues, and jazz singer, guitarist, record producer, and political activist. She co-founded Paredon Records with Irwin Silber.

""Bessie Smith in stereo,"" wrote jazz critic Leonard Feather in the late 1950s. Time wrote of Dane: ""The voice is pure, rich ... rare as a 20-carat diamond"" and quoted Louis Armstrong's exclamation upon hearing her at the Pasadena jazz festival: ""Did you get that chick? She's a gasser!"" On the occasion of her 85th birthday, The Boston Globe music critic James Reed called her ""one of the true unsung heroes of American music.""

Early life
Dane's parents arrived in Detroit from Arkansas in the 1920s. Out of high school, Dane began to sing regularly at demonstrations for racial equality and economic justice. While still in her teens, she sat in with bands locally and won the interest of local music promoters. She received an offer to tour with Alvino Rey's band, but she turned it down in favor of singing at factory gates and in union halls.

Career as singer
To Ebony magazine, she seemed ""startlingly blonde, especially when that powerful dusky alto voice begins to moan of trouble, two-timing men and freedom ... with stubborn determination, enthusiasm and a basic love for the underdog, [she is] making a name for herself ... aided and abetted by some of the oldest names in jazz who helped give birth to the blues."" The seven-page article was filled with photos of Dane working with Memphis Slim, Willie Dixon, Muddy Waters, Clara Ward, Mama Yancey, Little Brother Montgomery and others.

By 1959, Louis Armstrong had asked Time magazine readers: ""Did you get that chick? She's a gasser!"" After his invitation, she appeared with Armstrong on the nationally screened Timex All-Star Jazz Show hosted by Jackie Gleason on January 7, 1959. She toured the East Coast with Jack Teagarden, appeared in Chicago with Art Hodes, Roosevelt Sykes, Little Brother Montgomery, Memphis Slim, Otis Spann, Willie Dixon and others, played New York with Wilbur De Paris and his band, and appeared on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson as a solo guest artist. Other television work included The Steve Allen Show, Bobby Troup's Stars of Jazz, and Alfred Hitchcock Presents. 

In 1961, she opened her own club, Sugar Hill: Home of the Blues, on San Francisco's Broadway in the North Beach district, with the idea of creating a venue for the blues in a tourist district where a larger audience could hear it. At this location, Dane performed regularly with her two most constant musical companions: Kenny ""Good News"" Whitson on piano and cornet and Wellman Braud, the former Ellington bassist.

In her speech to the GI Movement of the Vietnam War Era (whose text can be found in the booklet included in Paredon Records' 1970 FTA! Songs of the GI Resistance LP), Barbara Dane said, ""I was too stubborn to hire one of the greed-head managers, probably because I'm a woman who likes to speak for herself. I always made my own deals and contracts, and after figuring out the economics of it, I was free to choose when and where I worked, able to spend lots more time with my three children and doing political work, and even brought home more money in the end, by not going for the 'bigtime.' I did make some really nice records, because I was able to choose and work with wonderfully gifted musicians.""

Political activism
She continued to weave in appearances as a solo performer on the coffeehouse circuit with her folk-style guitar. She opposed building a Pacific Gas and Electric nuclear plant at the seismically-precarious Bodega Bay. In organizing the resistance to that siting proposal, she recorded an album on the Fantasy label with Wally Rose, Bob Helm, Bob Mielke, and Lu Watters. It included the title track, ""Blues Over Bodega"", and another tune, ""San Andreas Fault"". 

She stepped up her work in the movements for peace and justice as the struggle for civil rights spread and the Vietnam war escalated. She sang at peace demonstrations in Washington, D.C. and throughout the U.S. and toured anti-war GI coffeehouses all over the world. In 1966, Dane became the first U.S. musician to tour post-revolutionary Cuba.

In January 1964, Bob Dylan praised Dane's commitment in an open letter he wrote to Broadside magazine: ""the heroes of this battle are not me an Joan [Baez] an the Kingston Trio... but there's some that could use the money I mean people like Tom Paxton, Barbara Dane an Johnny Herald... they are the heroes if such a word has t be used here... we need more kind a people like that people that can't go against their conscience no matter what they might gain an I've come to think that that might be the most important thing in the whole wide world.""

In 1970, Dane founded Paredon Records with husband Irwin Silber, a label specializing in international protest music. She produced nearly 50 albums, including three of her own, over a 12-year period. The label was later incorporated into Smithsonian Folkways, a label of the Smithsonian Institution, and is available through its catalog.

In 1978, Dane appeared with Pete Seeger at a rally in New York for striking coal miners.

Blues singer and role model
When Dane was in her late 70s, Philip Elwood, jazz critic of the San Francisco Examiner, said of her: ""Dane is back and beautiful... she has an immense voice, remarkably well-tuned... capable of exquisite presentations regardless of the material. As a gut-level blues singer, she is without compare."" Blues writer Lee Hildebrand calls her ""perhaps the finest living interpreter of the classic blues of the 1920s."" In a 2010 KALW profile on Dane, produced by Steven Short, blues musician Bonnie Raitt said ""she's always been a role model and a hero of mine – musically and politically. I mean, the arc of her life so informs mine that – she's – I really can't think of anyone I admire [more], the way that she's lived her life.""

Family
Dane was married to folk singer Rolf Cahn. Their son, Jesse Cahn, also became a folk musician. Pablo Menendez, Dane's son with jeweler Byron Menendez, leads Mezcla, a multicultural musical ensemble in Cuba. Nina Menendez, Dane's daughter, is the artistic director of the Bay Area Flamenco Festival and Festival Flamenco Gitano. In 1964, Dane married Irwin Silber, a Communist activist and former editor of Sing Out! magazine, who died in 2010. Dane resides in Oakland, California.

2178,['to run to going they are Who ?'],"Mammy's Cupboard (founded 1940) is a roadside restaurant built in the shape of a mammy archetype, located on US Highway 61 south of Natchez, Mississippi. The woman's skirt holds a dining room and a gift shop. The skirt is made out of bricks, and the earrings are horseshoes. She is holding a serving tray while smiling. Mammy's Cupboard has been through several renovations; the exterior has been repaired and the interior refurbished. The restaurant currently serves lunches and desserts.

The restaurant's founder was originally a tour guide of Natchez's nearby antebellum mansions and she believed tourists would also be interested in this type of restaurant. Also a mammy character had been portrayed in the very popular 1939 film Gone with the Wind, about the same time plans for the restaurant were being made. During the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s the Mammy's skin was repainted a lighter shade. The current owner said of the Mammy, ""There is honor in everything you do and for those who have young people. You have a crying child. Who are they going to run to? Nine times out of ten, they are going to run to the mammy... I want people to look at her and see that.""

The author of Crossings: A White Man's Journey Into Black America described the restaurant as ""a massive statue—twenty-eight feet [8.5 m] high—of a black woman dressed like Aunt Jemima, wearing a red scarf, a white blouse, and a red hoopskirt that actually houses a restaurant"", while the authors of Frommer's USA said that if you want to visit the restaurant, ""you need to check your political correctness at the door"". The restaurant's homemade pie was covered in the book American Pie and the newspaper The Press Democrat for National Pie Day.

2223,['Canticum Cantabimus Quomodo In ?'],"Isorhythm (from the Greek for ""the same rhythm"") is a musical technique using a repeating rhythmic pattern, called a talea, in at least one voice part throughout a composition. Taleae are typically applied to one or more melodic patterns of pitches or colores, which may be of the same or a different length from the talea.

History and development

Isorhythms first appear in French motets of the 13th century, such as in the Montpellier Codex. Although 14th-century theorists used the words talea and color—the latter in a variety of senses related to repetition and embellishment—the term ""isorhythm"" was not coined until 1904 by musicologist Friedrich Ludwig (1872–1930), initially to describe the practice in 13th-century polyphony. Ludwig later extended its use to the 14th-century music of Guillaume de Machaut. Subsequently, Heinrich Besseler and other musicologists expanded its scope further as an organizing structural element in 14th- and early 15th-century compositions—in particular, motets. Some of the earliest works organized around isorhythms are early 14th-century motets by various composers in an illuminated manuscript of the Roman de Fauvel. Two of the era's most important composers of isorhythmic motets are Phillipe de Vitry (1291–1361) and Guillaume de Machaut (c. 1300–1377). Machaut's second motet, De souspirant / Tous corps qui de bien amer / Suspiro, is an example of typical 14th-century use of isorhythm.

Isorhythm is a logical outgrowth of the rhythmic modes that governed most late medieval polyphony. Discarding modal-rhythmic limitations, isorhythm became a significant organizing principle of much of 14th-century French polyphony by extending the talea of an initial section to the entire composition in conjunction with variation of a corresponding color. ""The playful complexity of ...[taleae] that mixes mensuration and undergoes diminution by half—became a typical, even a defining feature of motets in the 14th century and beyond"".

The structural diagram at right shows the isorhythmic tenor voice of a late 14th-century motet, Sub arturo plebs / Fons citharizantium / In omnem terram by Johannes Alanus (c. late 14th century), featuring threefold isorhythmic diminution.

 Staff 1: preexisting Gregorian cantus firmus melody, from the first antiphon for the first nocturn of the commons for Apostles, In omnem terram exivit sonus eorum ('their voice has gone out into all the world'). The cantus firmus of the motet is a perfect fifth higher than the original chant; notes used for the tenor marked in red. 
 Staff 2: isorhythmic tenor as notated in mensural notation. Numbers 1–3 and brackets indicate three rhythmically identical sequences (taleae). The three mensuration signs in the beginning define the pattern of diminution, indicating tempus perfectum cum prolatio maior, tempus perfectum cum prolatio minor and tempus imperfectum cum prolatio minor, respectively. (In the manuscript these signs are in fact found at the end of the line, together with a repetition sign.) 
 Staves 3–5: abbreviated transcription into modern notation. Each line represents one full repetition of the tenor's melody (color), including the three taleae in each, resulting in a nine-part structure. (Within each color, only the first few notes of each talea are rendered here.) The three mensuration signs in the line above correspond to the change in time signatures: , , .

During the decades following and into the 15th century, upper voices became increasingly involved in isorhythmic organization. Many compositions became isorhythmic in all voices, a practice known as panisorhythm. In such compositions, the length of the color and talea are often unequal, causing the repetition of the melody in differing rhythmic patterns. As an example, if the ""color"" includes nine notes and the ""talea"" five, the ""color"" would have to be repeated five times before the two schemes again realign. Examples can be found in motets and Mass movements by John Dunstable, Johannes Ciconia and Guillaume Du Fay.

A 15th-century mass by a composer known only as Pycard found in the Old Hall manuscript (named for the English town in which it was eventually discovered), demonstrates the high sophistication and complexity of panisorhythmic techniques. The lower parts have a recurring color and talea that unite the composition. The upper parts have four different talea, one for each major section of the composition. The rhythmic relationship between upper and lower parts changes as the music progresses. Each quarter note in the lower part equals 4 quarter notes in the upper parts, creating an uneven ratio of 4:9 that causes the parts to lose synchronization. The lower part then steadily contracts in a series of Pythagorean proportions (12:9:8:6) until the parts come back into alignment.

As an analytical concept, isorhythm has proven valuable for understanding musical practices in other cultures; for example, the peyote culture songs of certain North American Indian groups and the music of India and Africa.

2258,['From Come Morals do Where ?'],"Darwin's Dangerous Idea: Evolution and the Meanings of Life is a 1995 book by the philosopher Daniel Dennett, in which the author looks at some of the repercussions of Darwinian theory. The crux of the argument is that, whether or not Darwin's theories are overturned, there is no going back from the dangerous idea that design (purpose or what something is for) might not need a designer. Dennett makes this case on the basis that natural selection is a blind process, which is nevertheless sufficiently powerful to explain the evolution of life. Darwin's discovery was that the generation of life worked algorithmically, that processes behind it work in such a way that given these processes the results that they tend toward must be so.

Dennett says, for example, that by claiming that minds cannot be reduced to purely algorithmic processes, many of his eminent contemporaries are claiming that miracles can occur. These assertions have generated a great deal of debate and discussion in the general public. The book was a finalist for the 1995 National Book Award in non-fiction and the 1996 Pulitzer Prize for General Non-Fiction.

Background

Dennett's previous book was Consciousness Explained (1991). Dennett noted discomfort with Darwinism among not only lay people but also even academics and decided it was time to write a book dealing with the subject. Darwin's Dangerous Idea is not meant to be a work of science, but rather an interdisciplinary book; Dennett admits that he does not understand all of the scientific details himself. He goes into a moderate level of detail, but leaves it for the reader to go into greater depth if desired, providing references to this end.

In writing the book, Dennett wanted to ""get thinkers in other disciplines to take evolutionary theory seriously, to show them how they have been underestimating it, and to show them why they have been listening to the wrong sirens"". To do this he tells a story; one that is mainly original but includes some material from his previous work.

Dennett taught an undergraduate seminar at Tufts University on Darwin and philosophy, which included most of the ideas in the book. He also had the help of fellow staff and other academics, some of whom read drafts of the book. It is dedicated to W. V. O. Quine, ""teacher and friend"".

Synopsis

Part I: Starting in the Middle
""Starting in the Middle"", Part I of Darwin's Dangerous Idea, gets its name from a quote by Willard Van Orman Quine: ""Analyze theory-building how we will, we all must start in the middle. Our conceptual firsts are middle-sized, middle-distance objects, and our introduction to them and to everything comes midway in the cultural evolution of the race.""

The first chapter ""Tell Me Why"" is named after a song.

Before Charles Darwin, and still today, a majority of people see God as the ultimate cause of all design, or the ultimate answer to 'why?' questions. John Locke argued for the primacy of mind before matter, and David Hume, while exposing problems with Locke's view, could not see any alternative.

Darwin provided just such an alternative: evolution. Besides providing evidence of common descent, he introduced a mechanism to explain it: natural selection. According to Dennett, natural selection is a mindless, mechanical and algorithmic process—Darwin's dangerous idea. The third chapter introduces the concept of ""skyhooks"" and ""cranes"" (see below). He suggests that resistance to Darwinism is based on a desire for skyhooks, which do not really exist. According to Dennett, good reductionists explain apparent design without skyhooks; greedy reductionists try to explain it without cranes.

Chapter 4 looks at the tree of life, such as how it can be visualized and some crucial events in life's history. The next chapter concerns the possible and the actual, using the 'Library of Mendel' (the space of all logically possible genomes) as a conceptual aid.

In the last chapter of part I, Dennett treats human artifacts and culture as a branch of a unified Design Space. Descent or homology can be detected by shared design features that would be unlikely to appear independently. However, there are also ""Forced Moves"" or ""Good Tricks"" that will be discovered repeatedly, either by natural selection (see convergent evolution) or human investigation.

Part II: Darwinian Thinking in Biology

The first chapter of part II, ""Darwinian Thinking in Biology"", asserts that life originated without any skyhooks, and the orderly world we know is the result of a blind and undirected shuffle through chaos.

The eighth chapter's message is conveyed by its title, ""Biology is Engineering""; biology is the study of design, function, construction and operation. However, there are some important differences between biology and engineering. Related to the engineering concept of optimization, the next chapter deals with adaptationism, which Dennett endorses, calling Gould and Lewontin's ""refutation"" of it an illusion. Dennett thinks adaptationism is, in fact, the best way of uncovering constraints.

The tenth chapter, entitled ""Bully for Brontosaurus"", is an extended critique of Stephen Jay Gould, who Dennett feels has created a distorted view of evolution with his popular writings; his ""self-styled revolutions"" against adaptationism, gradualism and other orthodox Darwinism all being false alarms. The final chapter of part II dismisses directed mutation, the inheritance of acquired traits and Teilhard's ""Omega Point"", and insists that other controversies and hypotheses  (like the unit of selection and Panspermia) have no dire consequences for orthodox Darwinism.

Part III: Mind, Meaning, Mathematics and Morality

""Mind, Meaning, Mathematics and Morality"" is the name of Part III, which begins with a quote from Nietzsche. Chapter 12, ""The Cranes of Culture"", discusses cultural evolution. It asserts that the meme has a role to play in our understanding of culture, and that it allows humans, alone among animals, to ""transcend"" our selfish genes. ""Losing Our Minds to Darwin"" follows, a chapter about the evolution of brains, minds and language. Dennett criticizes Noam Chomsky's perceived resistance to the evolution of language, its modeling by artificial intelligence, and reverse engineering.

The evolution of meaning is then discussed, and Dennett uses a series of thought experiments to persuade the reader that meaning is the product of meaningless, algorithmic processes.

Chapter 15 asserts that Gödel's Theorem does not make certain sorts of artificial intelligence impossible. Dennett extends his criticism to Roger Penrose. The subject then moves on to the origin and evolution of morality, beginning with Thomas Hobbes (who Dennett calls ""the first sociobiologist"") and Friedrich Nietzsche. He concludes that only an evolutionary analysis of ethics makes sense, though he cautions against some varieties of 'greedy ethical reductionism'. Before moving to the next chapter, he discusses some sociobiology controversies.

The penultimate chapter, entitled ""Redesigning Morality"", begins by asking if ethics can be 'naturalized'. Dennett does not believe there is much hope of discovering an algorithm for doing the right thing, but expresses optimism in our ability to design and redesign our approach to moral problems. In ""The Future of an Idea"", the book's last chapter, Dennett praises biodiversity, including cultural diversity. In closing, he uses Beauty and the Beast as an analogy; although Darwin's idea may seem dangerous, it is actually quite beautiful.

Central concepts

Design Space 
Dennett believes there is little or no principled difference between the naturally generated products of evolution and the man-made artifacts of human creativity and culture. For this reason he indicates deliberately that the complex fruits of the tree of life are in a very meaningful sense ""designed""—even though he does not believe evolution was guided by a higher intelligence.

Dennett supports using the notion of memes to better understand cultural evolution. He also believes even human creativity might operate by the Darwinian mechanism. This leads him to propose that the ""space"" describing biological ""design"" is connected with the space describing human culture and technology.

A precise mathematical definition of Design Space is not given in Darwin's Dangerous Idea. Dennett acknowledges this and admits he is offering a philosophical idea rather than a scientific formulation.

Natural selection as an algorithm 
Dennett describes natural selection as a substrate-neutral, mindless algorithm for moving through Design Space.

Universal acid 
Dennett writes about the fantasy of a ""universal acid"" as a liquid that is so corrosive that it would eat through anything that it came into contact with, even a potential container.  Such a powerful substance would transform everything it was applied to; leaving something very different in its wake.  This is where Dennett draws parallels from the “universal acid” to Darwin's idea: 
“it eats through just about every traditional concept, and leaves in its wake a revolutionized world-view, with most of the old landmarks still recognizable, but transformed in fundamental ways.”
While there are people who would like to see Darwin's idea contained within the field of biology, Dennett asserts that this dangerous idea inevitably “leaks” out to transform other fields as well.

Skyhooks and cranes
Dennett uses the term ""skyhook"" to describe a source of design complexity that does not build on lower, simpler layers—in simple terms, a miracle.

In philosophical arguments concerning the reducibility (or otherwise) of the human mind, Dennett's concept pokes fun at the idea of intelligent design emanating from on high, either originating from one or more gods, or providing its own grounds in an absurd, Munchausen-like bootstrapping manner.

Dennett also accuses various competing neo-Darwinian ideas of making use of such supposedly unscientific skyhooks in explaining evolution, coming down particularly hard on the ideas of Stephen Jay Gould.

Dennett contrasts theories of complexity that require such miracles with those based on ""cranes"", structures that permit the construction of entities of greater complexity but are themselves founded solidly ""on the ground"" of physical science.

Reception 
In The New York Review of Books, John Maynard Smith praised Darwin's Dangerous Idea:

It is therefore a pleasure to meet a philosopher who understands what Darwinism is about, and approves of it.
Dennett goes well beyond biology. He sees Darwinism as a corrosive acid, capable of dissolving our earlier belief and forcing a reconsideration of much of sociology and philosophy. Although modestly written, this is not a modest book. Dennett argues that, if we understand Darwin's dangerous idea, we are forced to reject or modify much of our current intellectual baggage...

Writing in the same publication, Stephen Jay Gould criticised Darwin's Dangerous Idea for being an ""influential but misguided ultra-Darwinian manifesto"":

Daniel Dennett devotes the longest chapter in Darwin's Dangerous Idea to an excoriating caricature of my ideas, all in order to bolster his defense of Darwinian fundamentalism. If an argued case can be discerned at all amid the slurs and sneers, it would have to be described as an effort to claim that I have, thanks to some literary skill, tried to raise a few piddling, insignificant, and basically conventional ideas to ""revolutionary"" status, challenging what he takes to be the true Darwinian scripture. Since Dennett shows so little understanding of evolutionary theory beyond natural selection, his critique of my work amounts to little more than sniping at false targets of his own construction. He never deals with my ideas as such, but proceeds by hint, innuendo, false attribution, and error.

Gould was also a harsh critic of Dennett's idea of the ""universal acid"" of natural selection and of his subscription to the idea of memetics; Dennett responded, and the exchange between Dennett, Gould, and Robert Wright was printed in the New York Review of Books.

Biologist H. Allen Orr wrote a critical review emphasizing similar points in the Boston Review.

The book has also provoked a negative reaction from creationists; Frederick Crews writes that Darwin's Dangerous Idea ""rivals Richard Dawkins's The Blind Watchmaker as the creationists' most cordially hated text.""

2326,['Gaze Female The Is What : Gebbie Melinda 2015 ?'],"The Horse Hospital is a Grade II listed not for profit, independent arts venue at Colonnade, Bloomsbury, central London. It has a curatorial focus on counter-cultural histories, sub-cultures and outsider as well as emerging artists. It delivers through frequent events, underground film and artist's moving image screenings, and exhibitions. Founded in 1992 by Roger K. Burton, the venue opened with Vive Le Punk! a retrospective of Vivienne Westwood's punk designs in 1993.

The building was originally built by James Burton in 1797 as stabling for cab drivers' sick horses.

History
Initially programmed by Burton and Ian White, the venue's reputation grew both in London and abroad. James B. L. Hollands later replaced White as curator. The artist, Tai Shani was the programmer from 2006 to 2016, followed by Sholto Dobie and Letitia Calin.

In 1998, the Horse Hospital hosted the debut British exhibition by outsider artist / painter Joe Coleman which attracted a new audience. Subsequently, the venue played host to a variety of performers, musicians, artists, film makers and writers, including Dame Darcy, Anita Pallenberg, Iain Aitch, Jack Sargeant, Valie Export, Chris Carter, David Tibet, Helen Chadwick, Dennis Cooper, Nan Goldin, Morton Bartlett, Lydia Lunch, Bruce Bickford, Gee Vaucher and Crass, Alejandro Jodorowsky, Stewart Home, Jeremy Reed, Franko B, Ron Athey, Banksy, Marc Almond, Yvonne Rainer, Artūras Barysas and others.

It has also been used by various record labels, publishing houses including Soft Skull Press, Verso, Serpent's Tail and Clear Cut Press. and journals such as Strange Attractor and Granta for special events, as well as a screening space for numerous film festivals including the Fashion in Film Festival, London International Animation Festival, London Porn Film Festival amongst others.

The Horse Hospital houses and is supported by the ‘Contemporary Wardrobe Collection’, a fashion archive that specialises in post-war street fashion, sub-cultures and British design. The Chamber of Pop Culture is located there. Proud Camden has been located there since about 2008.

In 2015 The Horse Hospital was listed with London Borough of Camden as a Community Asset and the site was selected for inclusion in the British Library’s UK Web Archive as a website of cultural importance.

In 2019 it was announced that The Horse Hospital was at risk of closure after its landlord proposed a 333 per cent rent increase, from £30,000 to £130,000 annually from the beginning of 2020. At the start of January 2020 it secured an extension on its lease until 28 February. Eventually, according to The Horse Hospital's website, a new lease was secured until December 2024, with a rent increase of 33%.

The building
The building is Grade II listed. It was originally built by James Burton in 1797 as stabling for cab drivers' sick horses, the Horse Hospital is notable for its unique stone tiled floor. Access to both floors is by concrete moulded ramps, the upper floor ramp retains hardwood slats preventing the horses from slipping. It can be found at Colonnade, Bloomsbury, London.

2351,"['Real Quanta Are ?', 'Computer the Invented Who ?']","Douglas Richard Hofstadter (born February 15, 1945) is an American scholar of cognitive science, physics, and comparative literature whose research includes concepts such as the sense of self in relation to the external world, consciousness, analogy-making, artistic creation, literary translation, and discovery in mathematics and physics. His 1979 book Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid won both the Pulitzer Prize for general nonfiction and a National Book Award (at that time called The American Book Award) for Science. His 2007 book I Am a Strange Loop won the Los Angeles Times Book Prize for Science and Technology.

Early life and education 
Hofstadter was born in New York City to Jewish parents: Nobel Prize-winning physicist Robert Hofstadter and Nancy Givan Hofstadter. He grew up on the campus of Stanford University, where his father was a professor, and attended the International School of Geneva in 1958–59. He graduated with distinction in mathematics from Stanford University in 1965, and received his Ph.D. in physics from the University of Oregon in 1975, where his study of the energy levels of Bloch electrons in a magnetic field led to his discovery of the fractal known as Hofstadter's butterfly.

Academic career 
Since 1988, Hofstadter has been the College of Arts and Sciences Distinguished Professor of Cognitive Science and Comparative Literature at Indiana University in Bloomington, where he directs the Center for Research on Concepts and Cognition which consists of himself and his graduate students, forming the ""Fluid Analogies Research Group"" (FARG). He was initially appointed to the Indiana University's Computer Science Department faculty in 1977, and at that time he launched his research program in computer modeling of mental processes (which he called ""artificial intelligence research"", a label he has since dropped in favor of ""cognitive science research""). In 1984, he moved to the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, where he was hired as a professor of psychology and was also appointed to the Walgreen Chair for the Study of Human Understanding. In 1988 he returned to Bloomington as ""College of Arts and Sciences Professor"" in both cognitive science and computer science. He was also appointed adjunct professor of history and philosophy of science, philosophy, comparative literature, and psychology, but has said that his involvement with most of those departments is nominal. In 1988 Hofstadter received the In Praise of Reason award, the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry's highest honor. In April 2009 he was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and a member of the American Philosophical Society. In 2010 he was elected a member of the Royal Society of Sciences in Uppsala, Sweden.

At the University of Michigan and Indiana University, he and Melanie Mitchell coauthored a computational model of ""high-level perception""—Copycat—and several other models of analogy-making and cognition, including the Tabletop project, co-developed with Robert M. French. The Letter Spirit project, implemented by Gary McGraw and John Rehling, aims to model artistic creativity by designing stylistically uniform ""gridfonts"" (typefaces limited to a grid). Other more recent models include Phaeaco (implemented by Harry Foundalis) and SeqSee (Abhijit Mahabal), which model high-level perception and analogy-making in the microdomains of Bongard problems and number sequences, respectively, as well as George (Francisco Lara-Dammer), which models the processes of perception and discovery in triangle geometry.

Hofstadter has had several exhibitions of his artwork in various university galleries. These shows have featured large collections of his gridfonts, his ambigrams (pieces of calligraphy created with two readings, either of which is usually obtained from the other by rotating or reflecting the ambigram, but sometimes simply by ""oscillation"", like the Necker Cube or the rabbit/duck figure of Joseph Jastrow), and his ""Whirly Art"" (music-inspired visual patterns realized using shapes based on various alphabets from India). Hofstadter invented the term ""ambigram"" in 1984; many ambigrammists have since taken up the concept.

Hofstadter collects and studies cognitive errors (largely, but not solely, speech errors), ""bon mots"", and analogies of all sorts, and his longtime observation of these diverse products of cognition. His theories about the mechanisms that underlie them have exerted a powerful influence on the architectures of the computational models he and FARG members have developed.

Hofstadter's thesis about consciousness, first expressed in Gödel, Escher, Bach but also present in several of his later books, is that it is ""an emergent consequence of seething lower-level activity in the brain"". In Gödel, Escher, Bach he draws an analogy between the social organization of a colony of ants and the mind seen as a coherent ""colony"" of neurons. In particular, Hofstadter claims that our sense of having (or being) an ""I"" comes from the abstract pattern he terms a ""strange loop"", an abstract cousin of such concrete phenomena as audio and video feedback that Hofstadter has defined as ""a level-crossing feedback loop"". The prototypical example of a strange loop is the self-referential structure at the core of Gödel's incompleteness theorems. Hofstadter's 2007 book I Am a Strange Loop carries his vision of consciousness considerably further, including the idea that each human ""I"" is distributed over numerous brains, rather than being limited to one.
Le Ton beau de Marot: In Praise of the Music of Language is a long book devoted to language and translation, especially poetry translation, and one of its leitmotifs is a set of 88 translations of ""Ma Mignonne"", a highly constrained poem by 16th-century French poet Clément Marot. In this book, Hofstadter jokingly describes himself as ""pilingual"" (meaning that the sum total of the varying degrees of mastery of all the languages that he has studied comes to 3.14159 ...), as well as an ""oligoglot"" (someone who speaks ""a few"" languages).

In 1999, the bicentennial year of the Russian poet and writer Alexander Pushkin, Hofstadter published a verse translation of Pushkin's classic novel-in-verse Eugene Onegin. He has translated other poems and two novels: La Chamade (That Mad Ache) by Françoise Sagan, and La Scoperta dell'Alba (The Discovery of Dawn) by Walter Veltroni, the then-head of the Partito Democratico in Italy. The Discovery of Dawn was published in 2007, and That Mad Ache was published in 2009, bound together with Hofstadter's essay Translator, Trader: An Essay on the Pleasantly Pervasive Paradoxes of Translation.

Hofstadter's Law 

Hofstadter's Law is ""It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter's Law."" The law is stated in Gödel, Escher, Bach.

Students 
Hofstadter's former Ph.D. students include (with dissertation title):

David Chalmers—Toward a Theory of Consciousness
Bob French—Tabletop: An Emergent, Stochastic Model of Analogy-Making
Melanie Mitchell—Copycat: A Computer Model of High-Level Perception and Conceptual Slippage in Analogy-making

Public image 
Hofstadter has said that he feels ""uncomfortable with the nerd culture that centers on computers"". He admits that ""a large fraction [of his audience] seems to be those who are fascinated by technology"", but when it was suggested that his work ""has inspired many students to begin careers in computing and artificial intelligence"" he replied that he was pleased about that, but that he himself has ""no interest in computers"". In that interview he also mentioned a course he has twice given at Indiana University, in which he took a ""skeptical look at a number of highly touted AI projects and overall approaches"". For example, upon the defeat of Garry Kasparov by Deep Blue, he commented that ""It was a watershed event, but it doesn't have to do with computers becoming intelligent"". In his book Metamagical Themas, he says that ""in this day and age, how can anyone fascinated by creativity and beauty fail to see in computers the ultimate tool for exploring their essence?"".

Provoked by predictions of a technological singularity (a hypothetical moment in the future of humanity when a self-reinforcing, runaway development of artificial intelligence causes a radical change in technology and culture), Hofstadter has both organized and participated in several public discussions of the topic. At Indiana University in 1999 he organized such a symposium, and in April 2000, he organized a larger symposium titled ""Spiritual Robots"" at Stanford University, in which he moderated a panel consisting of Ray Kurzweil, Hans Moravec, Kevin Kelly, Ralph Merkle, Bill Joy, Frank Drake, John Holland and John Koza. Hofstadter was also an invited panelist at the first Singularity Summit, held at Stanford in May 2006. Hofstadter expressed doubt that the singularity will occur in the foreseeable future.

In 1988 Dutch director Piet Hoenderdos created a docudrama about Hofstadter and his ideas, Victim of the Brain, based on The Mind's I. It includes interviews with Hofstadter about his work.

Columnist 
When Martin Gardner retired from writing his ""Mathematical Games"" column for Scientific American magazine, Hofstadter succeeded him in 1981–83 with a column titled Metamagical Themas (an anagram of ""Mathematical Games""). An idea he introduced in one of these columns was the concept of ""Reviews of This Book"", a book containing nothing but cross-referenced reviews of itself that has an online implementation. One of Hofstadter's columns in Scientific American concerned the damaging effects of sexist language, and two chapters of his book Metamagical Themas are devoted to that topic, one of which is a biting analogy-based satire, ""A Person Paper on Purity in Language"" (1985), in which the reader's presumed revulsion at racism and racist language is used as a lever to motivate an analogous revulsion at sexism and sexist language; Hofstadter published it under the pseudonym William Satire, an allusion to William Safire. Another column reported on the discoveries made by University of Michigan professor Robert Axelrod in his computer tournament pitting many iterated prisoner's dilemma strategies against each other, and a follow-up column discussed a similar tournament that Hofstadter and his graduate student Marek Lugowski organized. The ""Metamagical Themas"" columns ranged over many themes, including patterns in Frédéric Chopin's piano music (particularly his études), the concept of superrationality (choosing to cooperate when the other party/adversary is assumed to be equally intelligent as oneself), and the self-modifying game of Nomic, based on the way the legal system modifies itself, and developed by philosopher Peter Suber.

Personal life 
Hofstadter was married to Carol Ann Brush until her death. They met in Bloomington, and married in Ann Arbor in 1985. They had two children, Danny and Monica. Carol died in 1993 from the sudden onset of a brain tumor, glioblastoma multiforme, when their children were 5 and 2. The Carol Ann Brush Hofstadter Memorial Scholarship for Bologna-bound Indiana University students was established in 1996 in her name. Hofstadter's book Le Ton beau de Marot is dedicated to their two children and its dedication reads ""To M. & D., living sparks of their Mommy's soul"".

In 2010, Hofstadter met Baofen Lin in a cha-cha-cha class, and they married in Bloomington in September 2012.

Hofstadter has composed  pieces for piano and for piano and voice. He created an audio CD, DRH/JJ, which includes all these compositions performed mostly by pianist Jane Jackson, with a few performed by Brian Jones, Dafna Barenboim, Gitanjali Mathur and Hofstadter.

The dedication for I Am A Strange Loop is: ""To my sister Laura, who can understand, and to our sister Molly, who cannot."" Hofstadter explains in the preface that his younger sister Molly never developed the ability to speak or understand language.

As a consequence of his attitudes about consciousness and empathy, Hofstadter became vegan in his teenage years, and has remained primarily a vegetarian since that time.

In popular culture
In the 1982 novel 2010: Odyssey Two, Arthur C. Clarke's first sequel to 2001: A Space Odyssey, HAL 9000 is described by the character ""Dr. Chandra"" as being caught in a ""Hofstadter–Möbius loop"". The movie uses the term ""H. Möbius loop"".

On April 3, 1995, Hofstadter's book Fluid Concepts and Creative Analogies: Computer Models of the Fundamental Mechanisms of Thought was the first book sold by Amazon.com.

2482,"[""Maria Like Problem a Solve You Do How and Hawkes Chesney alongside cast been has Jackson , Anything Do 'd I Since ?""]","Francesca Jackson (born 6 December 1983) is a musical theatre actress. She took part in the Reality television show I'd Do Anything and lost out the role of Nancy to Jodie Prenger.

Background
Jackson was born in Wolverhampton, England to parents, Mel and Steve Jackson. She later moved to Ystalyfera, Swansea where she grew up and where her parents still live today. She has a BA in musical arts.

She joined the National Youth Music Theatre in 1991, and starred in many productions such as Whistle Down the Wind and Bugsy Malone. Jackson now resides in London.

Career
Although, receiving many acting and singing jobs since the age of 10, Francesca's first big break was playing Bet at the age of 14 in the Sam Mendes production of Oliver! at the London Palladium alongside Robert Lindsay and Sonia Swabey.

Jackson starred as Joanne in Rent remixed alongside Denise van Outen and she has also played the leading role of Alice in the workshop production of 'All the Fun of the Fair', directed by Nikolai Foster.
She appeared in the 2006 production of 'Tonight's the night' as an understudy for Rachel Tucker (future I'd Do Anything contestant). Later, Francesca auditioned for Reality TV show I'd Do Anything attempting to win the part of Nancy. She was put through and eliminated fourth on the live show.

She once shared an apartment with Connie Fisher, the future winner of How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria?.

Jackson was eliminated on the fourth show on 19 April, when she and fellow contestant, Ashley Russell received the fewest votes from the public. Both were put in the Sing-off, and Lloyd Webber saved Russel, therefore eliminating Jackson from the competition.

Since I'd Do Anything, Jackson has been cast alongside Chesney Hawkes and How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria? finalist Siobhan Dillon as 'Lucy' in a new Barry Manilow based musical named Can't Smile Without You.

In 2009, Jackson toured with Bill Kenwright's Dreamboats and Petticoats from 14 September 2009 – 5 December 2009, playing the role of Sue. In February 2010: Jackson completed a weeks run of A Little Night Music in Paris, appearing alongside Lambert Wilson, Leslie Caron, Greta Sacchi, Rebecca Bottone, Leon Lopez, Deanne Meek, David Curry, Celeste de Veazey, Directed by Lee Blakely. She reprised her role as 'Sue' in Dreamboats and Petticoats from late February to early July 2010, and toured with the show after the West End run finished.

She will be part of the original West End cast of Million Dollar Quartet in the role of Dyanne.

In 2021 she was appearing in the West End production of Tina The Musical as Tina Turner's friend Rhonda Graam. This was as the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK cooled and theatres re-opened.

2523,['( Sr Vladimir father his where city native his to returned He ?'],"Vladimir Vladimirovich Tsyganko (; ; also Țâganco, Tziganco, Tziganko or Țiganco; 1886/1887 – January 26, 1938) was a Bessarabian, and later Soviet, politician. The son of a distinguished architect, and himself an engineer by vocation, Tsyganko entered politics shortly before the proclamation of a Moldavian Democratic Republic, when he earned a seat in the republican legislature (Sfatul Țării). He sided with the parliamentary Peasants' Faction, which supported left-wing ideals and pushed for land reform, being generally, and radically, opposed to the more right-wing Moldavian Bloc. Tsyganko was skeptical of the Bloc's plan to unite Bessarabia with Romania, although he possibly supported a federation. His uncompromising stance divided his Faction and led the Romanian Kingdom's authorities to identify him as a major obstruction to the unionist cause.

In November 1918, as the Bloc switched its support to unconditional unification and dissolved the regional government bodies, Tsyganko rejected the new regime and moved to Odessa. Allying himself to members of the White movement, with whom he set up a Committee for the Salvation of Bessarabia, attending the Paris Peace Conference to campaign for the reversal of the union. He later settled in Soviet territory, where he helped create a Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic; other members of his family opted to stay behind in Romania. In 1937, Tsyganko fell victim to the Great Purge.

Biography

Early career
Tsyganko's paternal grandfather was a Don Cossack, Afanasy or Afanasie, who had reportedly deserted his post and made his way to the western reaches of the Russian Empire, in Bessarabian Governorate. Vladimir was born in Kishinev (Chișinău), regional capital of Bessarabia, and was a graduate of Riga Polytechnicum. He returned to his native city where his father Vladimir Sr (? – 1919), an architect, designed such landmarks as the Ethnography Museum and Saint Nicholas Church; his brother Nikolai (Nicolai) Vladimirovich (born 1882) was the zemstvo engineer in Orhei, and from 1909 in Kishinev itself. By 1904, their father was the Director of Monastery Estates in Bessarabia, in which capacity he testified against Russian police after the Kishinev pogrom, accusing them of passivity. 

In 1916, the Bessarabian journalist Alexis Nour described Tsyganko Sr. as a ""much esteemed [...] Bessarabian intellectual of a Moldavian nationalist hue, but not a separatist [in respect to Russia]"" (see Moldovenism). Also according to Nour, Nikolai, whom he met personally, could speak only Russian. Romanian politician Duiliu Zamfirescu, who met and debated with Vladimir Vladimirovich in 1918, claimed that the Tsygankos were ""Ruthenian"". He and his adversary talked in French, as Tsyganko ""could not speak a word of Romanian"". The same year, Tsyganko's political adversaries suggested that he was in fact of Bulgarian heritage, though mixed with ""some other nation"". Some ten years later, geographer Eugeniu Giurgea referred to Tsyganko Jr as Ukrainian.

According to notes left by Gherman Pântea, Tsyganko spent much of his youth in the United States, working as an engineer. He had returned to Bessarabia by the time World War I, and reached political prominence after the October Revolution, which had left the region to administer itself independently, as a ""Moldavian Democratic Republic"". In January 1918, the local Soviet of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies began to override the Sfatul Țării assembly (appointed the previous November) and attempted to bring about Bolshevik rule. This move was swiftly suppressed by a punitive expedition of the Romanian Army. The 3rd Peasants' Congress, assembled few days after the occupation of Chișinău, adopted an anti-secessionist position, dismissed the Moldavian prime-minister Pantelimon Erhan from the position of President of the Peasants' Soviet, and elected a new leadership from among the most vocal opponents of the Romanian intervention. According to the Rumcherod's newspaper, during the opening session, Tsyganko's message on behalf of the local Socialist Revolutionary branch was met with applause and calls to support the Russian Revolution. The following day, after demanding the withdrawal of Romanian troops within 24 hours, and negotiating on the issue with the Romanian military, the Congress' Presidium was put under arrest. General Ernest Broșteanu dismissed the immunity of those Peasants' representatives who were also members of Sfatul, and issued a strong warning against further anti-Romanian agitation. Consequently, the following days the Congress selected a new list of Sfatul representatives, headed by Tsyganko, which comprised mostly moderates.

Clashes with the unionists
Tsyganko, who was counted among the representatives of the Russian minority, affiliated with the left-wing ""Peasants' Faction"", which stood in opposition to the ""Moldavian Bloc"" of Romanian nationalists. Constantin Stere, who helped with organizing the latter group after returning from his Romanian exile, viewed Tsyganko as a leading obstacle in reconciling the agrarian and nationalist agendas: ""As for the Moldavian peasants, those whom I found united as a bloc under Țiganco, those who had seized the great estates with a revolution, they displayed strong feelings of fear and suspicion. They cast their leery sights across the Prut [into Romania], which they believed was a feudal country, where peasants had no rights, not even voting rights, and no land of their own"".

During the debates on land reform, Tsyganko suggested postponing the discussion until a new government, ""representative of the people's will"", would be approved by a Moldavian Constituent Assembly. Presumably, he feared that pressure from the Romanian troops would affect the extent of the reform. Nevertheless, he became the first chairman of Sfatuls Agrarian Commission, and in parallel presided upon the Peasants' Soviet. According to Giurgea, during his tenure at the Commission, he ""always sided with the Russians, blatantly so."" Despite being involved in left-wing politics, Tsyganko would gradually develop a working relationship with A. N. Krupensky, the Polono-Bessarabian landowner and ex-Marshal of Nobility, and Alexandr K. Schmidt, who stood for the conservative side of anti-Romanian agitation; between 1918 and 1920 the three men issued calls for the end of Romanian occupation, and began popularizing their cause in Europe.

When Romanian Premier Alexandru Marghiloman traveled to Bessarabia to canvass for the unionist cause, he found the Peasant Faction divided between followers of Ion Inculeț, who endorsed the Romanian viewpoint, and deputies who sided with Tsyganko. Zamfirescu, who traveled with Marghiloman, recalls that Tsyganko ""thrice in one month"" attempted to recall the Republic's Directorate, his moves resisted by Inculeț. He also protested the selection of pro-Romanian students from Kiev and Odessa as representatives of the Transnistrian Moldavians, in which he saw efforts to shake the balance of power inside the Sfatul. Zamfirescu claims to have saved Tsyganko from an undisclosed mortal danger, and then to have conversed with him, trying to gain insight into his political motivations. The latter, he concluded, were ""most phantasmagorical socialist ideas"", not dissuaded by the prospect of ""death, suffering, military disaster, sheer destitution, or degeneracy"". He adds: ""It was late at night, I was experiencing chills, and so I believe I have insulted the convictions of this visionary youth, reassuring him that all opinions lead to a ministerial chair, provided one makes sure to discard them on cue.""

Despite proclaiming its independence in late February 1918, the Moldavian Republic was still seen in various circles as subordinate to the neighboring Ukrainian People's Republic. Its Central Rada wished to represent Bessarabia in the preliminary negotiation of the Bucharest peace treaty, imposed by the Central Powers on Romania. Sfatul reacted by reaffirming its independence and rejecting the division of Bessarabia—against the Akkerman and Khotin zemstva, which had proclaimed their accession to the Ukraine. A Moldavian delegation was therefore selected to head to Kiev and obtain from the Central Rada official recognition of Moldavia's independence. The delegation, which included the interior minister Vladimir Cristi, nationalists Nicolae Secară and Teodor Neaga, and Tsyganko as representative of the Peasants' Faction, was prevented from leaving. According to the unionist Gheorghe Andronachi, it was Daniel Ciugureanu, the Republic's pro-Romanian prime minister, who intervened with the Romanian Army to hamper the departure, fearing that an international recognition of independence would hinder nationalist plans for union with Romania.

March union vote
On March 27, 1918, when Sfatul voted to support the union with Romania, Tsyganko effectively abstained. In April, the pro-Romanian newspaper Cuvânt Moldovenesc attacked Tsyganko for his obstructionism and his perceived lack of political legitimacy, claiming that his Peasant Faction was a personal party, the ""Tsygankists"". Zamfirescu found it ""unbelievable"" that Romanian-speaking peasants had ever endorsed Tsyganko, who, he claimed, ""systematically opposes Bessarabia's government and Romania's policies, endeavoring for its annexation to the Ukraine""; however, he also notes that Tsyganko himself accused the Romanians of wanting to hand over Bessarabia to the Ukrainians. Historian Theodor Codreanu believes that Tsyganko actually supported the latter option, and therefore that he ""saluted the presence of Romanian troops"" as long as they seemed to fulfill that requirement. 

A radical project for land reform had received pledges of support from Sfatul secretary Ion Buzdugan, and also from Marghiloman himself; consequently, according to historian Alberto Basciani, Tsyganko's critique of unionism became marginal within his own party and Soviet. On behalf of the Peasant Faction, Tsyganko denied the Assembly even had the authority to discuss such an issue, declaring his group would refrain from voting on the union, since they considered this a matter for a Constitutional Convention; furthermore, he stated the only admissible terms for a union between the Moldavian and Romanian peoples would be in a federation. Five members of his faction decided to side with the nationalists and voted for the union, while the other 17 present abstained. According to Cuvânt Moldovenesc, this was an ethnic split, with the five being ""Moldavian"" or Romanian natives rather than Slavs; according to this report, only one or two of those abstaining were ""Moldavian"". The newspaper dismissed Tsyganko's claim that Sfatul had no say in the matter of union, claiming that what really upset the deputy was ""seeing these good Moldavians, who voted for unification with Romania, emerging from this as the true lords and masters of this land that has up to now been dragged down by Tsygankolings"". This account was backed in 1921 by Stere, who took personal credit for having ""plucked the Moldavian peasants out of Țiganco's peasant bloc"". 

More modern researchers are divided in their assessments of Tsyganko's political stance at that early stage. Basciani describes him as one of those who ""opposed with great vehemence the union of Bessarabia with Romania"". However, according to Svetlana Suveică, Tsyganko did not object to union with autonomy, and in fact saw it as ""the only solution for avoiding the Bolshevik invasion of the region."" In November, after the generalization of Romanian military rule in Bessarabia, Tsyganko, as putative ""president"" of the Bessarabian Peasants' Party, with Nicolae Alexandri, Ion Păscăluță, and 37 other Sfatul members, sent a letter of protest to the Romanian government of Constantin Coandă. This coalition of Romanian Bessarabians and White Russians demanded the immediate recognition and restoration of autonomy, as well as the lifting of the martial law; however, its imperatives were rejected as illegitimate by the central authorities. According to Clark: ""We cannot but applaud the admirable aims of the 40 Deputies, in most of their requests; but at the same time we must wonder at their ingenuousness; they did not foresee the constant turbulence on the Eastern frontier, which even at that time impressed the Roumanians"".

November union vote
The protest arose controversy in political circles. Tsyganko reported a private interview with the Romanian envoy Artur Văitoianu. He quoted the latter as offering a deal: ""You must renounce [autonomy] if only for this sole reason—that you no good Roumanian officials in Bessarabia—that is to say, none who are good nationalists. If you give up autonomy, you will not have a Commissioner-General, but you will have a Bessarabian Chargé d'Affaires, a man of your own character, who will be nominated by the Central Power. The new [Bessarabian] Directorate will remain in office until the meeting of the Pan-Roumanian Constitutional Assembly. Does this appeal to you as attractive?"" Also according to Tsyganko, Văitoianu informed the group that they needed to coalesce with Romanian nationalists in front of Great Russian revivalism, and that ""the national idea takes precedence over everything"", implicitly threatening Sfatul dignitaries.

As Suveică writes, it was only at this stage that Tsyganko became an adversary of the unionist camp, placing his hopes in a reestablishment of the Russian Republic, and her re-annexation of Bessarabia. At the last Sfatul session, on November 25, 1918, unconditional union was proposed for ratification, as one of several measures being voted on, alongside the allocation of offices and a land-reform-law. According to the Peasants' Faction account, also supported by many of the Moldavian nationalists who had signed the earlier protest, the Moldavian Bloc kept the opposition uniformed about there being a Sfatul session: ""only Mr. V. Tziganko was aware of the fact, and he was informed privately, two hours before the opening of the sitting."" The Tsyganko group confronted the assembly's president, Halippa, arguing that his election was illegal. They announced another walk-out, to which voices of the Moldavian Bloc responded with rhetorical questions (""Is this how you intend to solve the agrarian issue?"") and taunts of ""Good riddance!""

The opposition maintained that the walk-out resulted in a lack of quorum: only 48 of 160 deputies were reportedly present, which made the voting results questionable. Tsyganko and his colleagues accused the Bloc of putting up unconditional union for the vote as a rider, at 2.30 AM on the morning of November 26, and of counting votes during considerable and purposeful commotion. Some of the Fraction deputies in the opposition, including Tsyganko and Gavril Buciușcan, actually returned in time to cast their Nay votes. Clark claims that one of the Moldavian Bloc representatives testified that there were enough deputies present. According to Moldavian Bloc's Pan Halippa, Tsyganko's walk-out from the Assembly Hall proved to be a miscalculation, as the Peasant Faction's other members returned to vote on land reform, and, subsequently, on the unconditional union. Marghiloman nevertheless gave a contrasting account. He complained that ""not even 30 deputies"" had been present for the vote abrogating the conditions, in spite of ""all the money spent"".

Salvation Committee
In early 1919, Tsyganko emigrated from what was then being recognized as Romanian territory. He settled in Odessa, a Ukrainian port city, where he established the Peasants' Faction in exile, alongside a dozen other former Sfatul deputies. He joined efforts with Krupensky and Schmidt, affiliating with their Committee for the Salvation of Bessarabia, whose activities were closely monitored by Romania's secret police, the Siguranța. According to the Moldavian Bloc's Petru Cazacu, they answered indirectly to Anton Denikin, commander of the Volunteer Army.

The various groups of Bessarabian autonomists and White loyalists agreed to send a common delegation to the Peace Conference in Paris, where the Allies were debating on recognizing the union. On February 10, the Committee issued a common platform for these organizations, sharing two goals: ""the liberation of Bessarabia from the Romanian annexation and the realization of the aspirations of the people of Bessarabia."" The latter referred to the region's reintegration into Russia. In April, together with Krupensky and Schmidt, later followed by Mark Slonim and Mihail Savenco, Tsyganko had arrived in Paris. In its addresses to the international media, the group insisted that the union was a putsch by urban intellectuals against the other social classes. It also circulated a protest against the Romanian land reform project, which the Salvation Committee saw as a chauvinistic attack against the landed gentry and the Russian patriots.

As noted by Suveică, Tsyganko was the only delegation member to belong to a non-aristocratic elite, and nominally an appointee of the ""Central Committee of the Peasants of Bessarabia"". He therefore took some distance from the conservative demands of the Salvation Committee, and in various contexts presented himself as an independent emissary, united with the others mainly in their common support for a plebiscite clause in Bessarabia. However, his autonomism and Krupensky's loyalism were mostly endorsed by the White émigré lobby in Paris, including the likes of Georgy Lvov, Vasily Maklakov, Sergey Sazonov, and Nikolai Tchaikovsky. In his papers, Halippa commented that Tsyganko, the self-proclaimed ""socialist and revolutionary"", had arrived in Paris as a propagandist of Russian nationalism, ""with no connection to the people [of Bessarabia]"". Cazacu also notes that the ""bizarre association"" comprising Tsyganko, Maklakov and Schmidt propagated the contradictory claim that Sfatul was a ""Bolshevik"" assembly.

In June 1919, the French communist organ, L'Humanité, gave exposure to Slonim and Tsyganko's allegations regarding political repression and ""atrocities"" in Bessarabia, as a common protest of the ""democrats and socialists"". Such allegations were responded to by the Peasant Party's Ion Pelivan, who wrote the newspaper to argue that Romania's intervention had first of all restored ""liberty and democracy"" in Bessarabia, and that the union expressed ""the free will of the Bessarabian populace, with no outside intervention."" Marghiloman was also critical of ""the separatist"" Tsyganko, dismissing the accusations. Although he acknowledged some abuse of powers by Romanian administrators, including the ""destruction of villages"", he argued that it was ""nothing compared"" to what was being done by the French Army, also present in the region (see Southern Front of the Russian Civil War). Countering Tsyganko's claim to speak for the peasants, the pro-Romanian delegation grew to include peasant members such as Ion Codreanu, Gheorghe Năstase, and Sergiu Victor Cujbă.

Later life
Making his split from the White Russian community a definitive one, Tsyganko eventually settled in the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. In September 1921, he wrote a memorandum on Bessarabia and Romania–Russia relations, which he sent to Leon Trotsky, the Commissar for Military Affairs. His text informed the Russian viewpoint at the negotiations in Warsaw between the Soviets and the Romanians, but also presented personal observations on the social makeup of Bessarabia. Tsyganko argued that the Moldavian Republic's creation and union were attributable to left-wing ""agitators"" such as Inculeț and Pantelimon Erhan. He claimed that multi-ethnic Bessarabia was naturally ""internationalist"", but also rural and ""well-off"", concluding that an anti-Romanian revolt could happen if sustained from across the border. Cazacu noted in 1924 that the dossier compiled by the Bolsheviks and the earlier Salvation Committee drafts used as sources the same documents, including statements by private individuals.

In April 1924, Tsyganko and Schmidt attended the Romanian–Soviet diplomatic conference in Vienna. They were joined there by Nicolae Ferendino and peasant Gheorghe Broască, as the ""delegation of Bessarabian refugees in the Soviet Union"". Tsyganko read out the delegation's Russian-language memorandum, which underscored his loyalty toward the Soviet Union. Later that year, he became a founding figure of the Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, created on Soviet territory as a Bessarabian rump state. In September 1926, he was at Odessa, where, together with Ivan Krivorukov, he issued a formal protest against Italy's recognition of the Bessarabian union with Romania, and therefore against her ""passage into the anti-Soviet camp"". 

Nikolai Vladimirovich, meanwhile, remained behind in Romania, working as a conservator for the Historical Monuments Commission, then as Department head for Chișinău City Hall. In early 1929, Nikolai supported the Bessarabian regionalist platform for administrative reform (an initiative spearheaded by Erhan and Alexandru Mîță). He died some five years later, at age 52, while reading a book. Moving to Leningrad, Vladimir Tsyganko also fell back on his professional career. He served as deputy technical director of the State Institute for the Design of Metallurgical Plants, and was then head of the technical control department of the Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Works. Nevertheless, in 1937 he was singled out as a political suspect by the Stalinist regime, at the height of the Great Purge. Arrested on November 29, he was sentenced to death on December 2 and executed shortly after, in January 1938.

2533,"['else where — for planned honeymoon a with first married getting up end but , ladies their leave nearly Stooges The ?']","Gents Without Cents is a 1944 short subject directed by Jules White starring American slapstick comedy team The Three Stooges (Moe Howard, Larry Fine and Curly Howard). It is the 81st entry in the series released by Columbia Pictures starring the comedians, who released 190 shorts for the studio between 1934 and 1959.

Plot
The Stooges are small-time song-and-dance performers who are having trouble rehearsing due to loud tapping that is going on one story above them. When they go to give the rowdies a piece of their mind, three lovely ladies named Flo (Lindsay Bourquin), Mary (Laverne Thompson) and Shirley (Betty Phares) come to the door. It turns out the girls are performing their tap dance routine. The six become friends and go to a talent agent, Manny Weeks (John Tyrrell), to show off their stuff. However, he is at first unimpressed with the Stooges' act, but hires them anyway to perform at the Noazark Shipbuilding Company to entertain defense workers.

The Stooges, as ""Two Souls and a Heel"", slay the audience with their hilarious ""Niagara Falls"" routine (""slowly I turned, step by step, inch by inch...""). When the boys receive word that the headliners (The Castor and Earl Review) have to bail, they and the girls offer to take their place. Weeks is so enthralled with the boys' performance that he offers to send the trio to Broadway.

The Stooges nearly leave their ladies, but end up getting married first with a honeymoon planned for — where else? — Niagara Falls. Curly ends up running for his life from a carload of fellow Stooges Moe; Larry and their brides.

Production notes
The Stooges filmed the ""Niagara Falls"" routine in 1943 for the feature film Good Luck, Mr. Yates, but the scene was cut at the last minute. Instead of wasting the footage, Columbia built Gents Without Cents around it. Filming commenced on June 14–16, 1944.

Gents Without Cents is the first Stooge film to employ a syncopated, jazzy version of ""Three Blind Mice"" as the Stooges' theme song. The new version is in the key of F, while the key of G was previously utilized. This syncopated version would be used briefly after the next film, No Dough Boys. This version was revamped during the Shemp Howard and Joe Besser era. The title is a play on ""without sense."" Other parodies include The Noazark (Noah's Ark) Shipbuilding Company and show headliners, the Castor and Earl (castor oil) Revue.

Weeks is unimpressed at first because the trio sing a peppy/sappy song in the passé style of about 1910 called ""We Just Dropped In To Say Hello"". He brightens up when they start a more up-to-date, jazzy nonsense scat singing number called ""Rat-tat-toodle-oodle-day-ay"".

The theatrical agent's sign lists business locations as ""New York, Chicago, London ... Berlin soon"". This film was released just a few months after D-Day, at a time when Allied forces were making steady advances. The scat singing part of the Stooges' audition for the agent includes parodies of Hideki Tōjō (Larry), Benito Mussolini (Curly), and Adolf Hitler (Moe).

An obvious flub was left in the short at approximately 12:27 (the end of the ""Niagara Falls"" routine) as Larry misses the line ""... step-by-step"" going directly to ""...inch by inch,"" while Moe says the line correctly. It is unclear why director Jules White left the mistake in, when using an alternate, correct, take would have taken only a few minutes, unless he felt that such a mistake would be consistent with the amateur entertainment that Howard, Fine, and Howard were supposed to be in the short.

2573,"['Matter Education Does , book her In ?', 'Matter Education Does ?']","Alison Margaret Wolf, Baroness Wolf of Dulwich,  (nee Potter, born 31 October 1949) is a British economist, academic, and life peer. She is the Sir Roy Griffiths Professor of Public Sector Management at King's College London; Director of the International Centre for University Policy Research, King's Policy Institute; and Director of the university's MSc programme in Public Sector Policy and Management. Her latest book is The XX Factor (published by Crown Books in the US and Profile Books in the UK).

Early life and education
Wolf was born on 31 October 1949. She was educated at Oxford High School, an all-girls independent school in Oxford, England. She studied at the University of Neuchatel and Somerville College, Oxford.

Career

Her early career was spent in the United States as a policy analyst for the government.  She then worked many years at the Institute of Education of the University of London where she was guest professor. She is a member of the Advisory Committee for Education for the House of Commons of the United Kingdom and a member of the council of the United Nations University.  She writes frequent articles in the British press and moderated a programme on BBC Radio 4.  She is a member of the International Accounting Education Standards Board and has worked as a consultant for the European Commission, Bar Council, OECD, Royal College of Surgeons and the Ministries of Education of New Zealand, France and South Africa.

Wolf studies the interface between educational institutions and labour markets. She also has a research interest in performance studies, maths education, training, tertiary education and employment in the health sector.

In her book, Does Education Matter? Myths about Education and Economic Growth, she questioned the widespread view that higher public expenditure on education would increase economic growth. Instead, the causality ran in the opposite direction.  For the individual, the crucial skills in the labour market are primarily the mathematical and linguistic skills that are taught in school.  She therefore recommends investment in primary and secondary education rather than the tertiary level. In 2013, her book The XX Factor was published by Profile Books.

On 21 October 2014, it was announced that Wolf was to become a Crossbench life peer, having been nominated personally by the Prime Minister. She was created Baroness Wolf of Dulwich, of Dulwich in the London Borough of Southwark on 2 December 2014.

Personal life
Wolf is married to the economics journalist Martin Wolf. They have had three children together, two boys and a girl.

Honours
Wolf was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2012 Birthday Honours for services to education. She is an Honorary Fellow of Somerville College, Oxford.

2681,['to Scout ?'],"The 3rd New York Cavalry Regiment (""Van Alen Cavalry"") was a cavalry regiment that served in the Union Army during the American Civil War.

Service

2707,"['cartoons Disney 1950s classic with common in have game action this does What "" : wrote and A an game the gave Weekly Entertainment ?']","QuackShot Starring Donald Duck (also simply known as QuackShot), released in Japan as QuackShot Gurujia-ō no Hihō (QuackShot グルジア王の秘宝, QuackShot The Treasure of the King Garuzia), is a 1991 platforming video game developed and published by Sega for the Sega Genesis. The game was released in Europe in 1991, in North America on December 19, 1991, and in Japan the following day. QuackShot stars Donald Duck and his three nephews, Huey, Dewey, and Louie, as treasure-hunters, and is part of a series of games published by Sega that were based on Disney cartoon characters. The game was influenced by the Indiana Jones film series.

QuackShot was released mostly with positive reviews from video game journalists. The game was universally lauded for its graphics, with magazines like Sega Pro describing them as ""some of the best graphics around"". The game was also praised for its music and puzzles. However, QuackShot was criticized for its controls, being described by IGN as ""float-y"" and making certain segments of the game unnecessarily difficult. The game was also criticized for its lack of difficulty overall as well as its lack of speech samples, which several other Genesis games of the time had.

Gameplay

The player, as Donald, ventures through a variety of side-scrolling levels. Generally, each level is divided into an overland part and a dungeon, such as the Maharajah's palace or the temple in which the Great Duck Treasure resides. Although the player may choose any order to play the overland sections, various obstacles prevent the player from entering the dungeons outside of a specific order. In addition to this, some levels provide the player with vital clues which solve puzzles needed to progress in later sections. Once Donald has completed the overland section of an area, he may leave by calling his nephews' biplane, and will return to the dungeon entrance of that area if the player chooses to return.

Donald is armed with a special gun that can shoot plungers, popcorn or bubble gum. Donald has unlimited plungers which can temporarily stun enemies (though bosses can still be damaged with plungers), and can collect popcorn and gum along the way or get the latter from Gyro Gearloose. Later in the game, the plunger is upgraded to act as a temporary platform to climb walls with and, when stuck to a passing bird, allows Donald to traverse longer distances. In the overland sections of Duckburg, India, and Egypt, Donald can also pick up chili peppers which increase his temper, eventually temporarily activating a ""quack attack"" mode that allows him to become invincible, automatically run forward and knock out enemies in his path.

Plot
While Donald is flipping through some books in Scrooge McDuck's library, a map falls out of a book relating to the treasure of King Garuzia, ruler of the Great Duck Kingdom in ancient times. The map leads to the location of the king's most prized possession, hidden in a secret place shortly before his death. Donald thinks this is his path to riches. Unfortunately Big Bad Pete overhears and pursues Donald throughout the game hoping to steal the treasure.

Teamed with his nephews Huey, Dewey, and Louie, and using the partial map from the library, Donald begins his search in Duckburg, with the trail being directed to an Aztec pyramid in Mexico. Outside the pyramid, he is directed by a ""sweet seniorita"" to obtain a ""hero key"" from an explorer back in Duckburg to open the pyramid. Inside the pyramid, Donald meets Goofy, who gives him a strange note and a plunger to help him reach higher places, and tells him that Gyro Gearloose is looking for him back in Duckburg. Travelling across the rooftops of Duckburg to meet Gyro, Donald is given Gyro's latest invention, bubblegum ammo that can break through walls. The last location on the partial map is Count Dracula's castle in Transylvania, where Donald encounters a ghost who tells him that the Count carries the real treasure map.

After defeating Dracula, Donald receives a more complete map. In India, Donald enters the palace of the Maharajah, where she challenges him to defeat the tiger (known as Shere Khan) in her garden in exchange for a Sphinx Tear. Donald succeeds and receives the Sphinx Tear, which is the key to opening a temple in Egypt. Donald is able to solve the ""Riddle of the Sphinx"" using the note Goofy had given him and obtains the Scepter of Ra before escaping in a minecart. From there, he journeys to the South Pole, where he finds a key frozen in ice, and uses the Scepter of Ra to melt the ice and grab the key. The key unlocks the hold of a Viking ship, which contains an ancient diary with the secret to locating the treasure. The ship is haunted by ghosts, and the Viking captain sends Donald below decks to get rid of them. After defeating a skeletal Viking warrior, Donald returns to the deck, where the captain informs him that the diary is hidden in ice near the South Pole, and gives him an ""ancient Viking plunger"" that attaches to flying creatures. Donald then returns to the South Pole, hitching a ride on one of Pete's bird minions to reach the diary.

However, upon finding the diary, Pete shows up, holding Donald's nephews hostage in exchange for the diary. After giving Pete the diary, Donald travels to Pete's hideout to defeat Pete and get the diary back. The diary reveals that the map, when dipped in water, will reveal the location of the Great Duck Treasure. Donald flies to the island where the treasure is hidden and manages to evade its traps in order to reach the treasure vault. After defeating the elderly knight guarding the treasure, Donald opens the vault only to find a simple stone statue. When the disappointed Donald returns home, Huey, Dewey, and Louie accidentally break the statue, which reveals a golden jeweled necklace was hidden inside. Donald gives the necklace to Daisy and the two fly off into the sunset together.

Development and release
QuackShot was developed and published by Sega for the Sega Genesis as part of a series of games that were based on Walt Disney cartoon characters. By May, Sega presented the game at the Consumer Electronics Show. The game was released in Europe in 1991, in North America on December 19, 1991 and in Japan the following day. QuackShot was later released as part of a bundle called The Disney Collection for Genesis in 1996 alongside Castle of Illusion. The game was also ported to the Sega Saturn and released exclusively in Japan alongside Castle of Illusion again as part of the Sega Ages series in 1998, entitled Sega Ages: I Love Mickey Mouse.

Reception

In the United Kingdom, QuackShot was the top-selling Mega Drive game upon release.

QuackShot received a mostly positive response from critics upon release. GameRankings, an aggregator for video game reviews, assigned the game a score of 77% based on 2 reviews. MegaTech magazine praised the game's graphics, but criticized the game's easiness. Damian Butt from Sega Pro also praised the graphics, and noted the game's various puzzles, explaining that ""[e]ven if the ideas are not original, the way they are strung together to accelerate the pace to overload is nothing short of breath-taking"". Levi Buchanan from IGN gave QuackShot a 7.3/10, also lauding the graphics and animation as excellent and saying the music was pleasing.

Butt criticized Donald's controls in certain situations in the game, as well as the difficulty of some levels and puzzles. Buchanan also criticized the controls, calling them ""float-y"" and noted the difficulty in executing precision jumps, explaining that ""[i]t's far too easy to over- or under-shoot a narrow column and slip to your doom"". Butt was also ""dubious of the number of credits"", stating that the game may seem easy with unlimited continues, but that the player will ""still need considerable skill to reach the treasure island"". Buchanan was disappointed with the lack of speech samples, explaining that it's ""a bit of a drag with a character that is so defined by his voice"". Ultimately, Butt said that ""[y]ounger players will instantly be enthralled by Donald's quest"" and that ""QuackShot is everything a cartoon game should be and more"". Buchanan summed up the game as being a ""good platformer tripped up by some questionable controls"" and recommended the game as ""a mildly enjoyable 16-bit platformer that would fit nicely in your Genesis collection"".

Entertainment Weekly gave the game an A and wrote: ""What does this action game have in common with classic 1950s Disney cartoons? The completely deranged hero. During the Donald's 'quack attacks', the feathers practically fly off the screen and into your lap"".

Mega placed the game at #7 in their ""Top Mega Drive Games of All Time"" list. In 2017, Gamesradar ranked the game 28th on its ""Best Sega Genesis/Mega Drive games of all time"".

2807,"['what ... or faction powerful a of leadership , company the of control , championship a win can You ?']","Sacrifice (2009) was a professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), which took place on May 24, 2009 at the TNA Impact! Zone in Orlando, Florida. It was the fifth event under the Sacrifice chronology. There were eight matches on the card.

The show's main event was a Four Way Ultimate Sacrifice match, which pitted TNA World Heavyweight Champion, Mick Foley, against Sting, Kurt Angle, and Jeff Jarrett with each participant wagering an important aspect of their career: Foley's title, Sting's career, Angle's leadership of the Main Event Mafia, and Jarrett's shares in the company. The match was ultimately won by Sting, who pinned Angle, thus winning leadership of the Main Event Mafia.

There were two other high-profile matches with A.J. Styles defending the TNA Legends Championship against Booker T in an ""I Quit"" match as well as Beer Money, Inc. winning the ""Team 3D Invitational Tag Team Tournament"" against The British Invasion. Other matches on the undercard included: a six-man tag team match between the team of Jay Lethal, Consequences Creed, and Eric Young versus the Motor City Machineguns and Sheik Abdul Bashir, Daffney versus Taylor Wilde in a Monster's Ball match, Christopher Daniels challenging Suicide for his TNA X Division Championship, Angelina Love defending her title against Awesome Kong, and Samoa Joe versus Kevin Nash.

In October 2017, with the launch of the Global Wrestling Network, the event became available to stream on demand.

Storylines
Sacrifice featured eight professional wrestling matches and one pre-show match that involved different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds and storylines. Wrestlers portrayed villains, heroes, or less distinguishable characters in the scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.

The four-way match for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship, entitled the ""Ultimate Sacrifice"" match, was announced on the April 23 episode of TNA's primary television program, TNA Impact!, by TNA co-founder Jeff Jarrett. The theme of the match being that each participant must risk something valuable, and if they were pinned or made to submit during the match, they would lose what they wagered. Mick Foley would wager the TNA World Heavyweight Championship, Kurt Angle would risk his leadership of the villainous alliance The Main Event Mafia, Sting would retire from wrestling, and Jarrett would wager his voting shares within the company, thus putting up his authority.

Another storyline heading into Sacrifice was between A.J. Styles and Booker T. At Destination X, Styles won the TNA Legends Championship from Booker, intensifying their rivalry. On the April 30 edition of Impact!, one final confrontation between the two led to TNA management scheduling Styles to defend his title in an ""I Quit"" match against Booker T; this match requires the two wrestlers to fight until one wrestler says, ""I Quit"".

The main rivalry from the women's division was between Angelina Love and Awesome Kong. At Lockdown, Love won the TNA Women's Knockout Championship from Kong in a three-way match by pinning Taylor Wilde. On the April 30 and May 7 editions of Impact!, Kong defeated Love's associates in her group, The Beautiful People, Madison Rayne and Velvet Sky (and later Love's manager, Cute Kip) in stretcher matches.

In the tag team division, current IWGP Tag Team and TNA World Tag Team Champions, Team 3D (Brother Ray and Brother Devon), announced the Team 3D Invitational Tag Team Tournament. The tournament would be an eight-team, three-round single-elimination tournament with the winning team receiving a trophy, a check for $100,000, and a shot at the TNA World Tag Team Championship. On the May 7 edition of Impact!, in the semifinals, James Storm and Robert Roode, also known as Beer Money, Inc., advanced to the finals by defeating Eric Young and Jethro Holliday. The following week of Impact had Doug Williams and Brutus Magnus (collectively known as The British Invasion) advancing to the finals after defeating Suicide and Amazing Red.

Event

Pre-show
Before the show was broadcast live, a match aired on TNA's web site and for free on television, which pitted Amazing Red against Kiyoshi. Red won the match by pinfall after performing a standing shooting star press.

Preliminary matches

The first match on the show was a Six-Man Tag Team match between the team of Eric Young and Lethal Consequences (Jay Lethal and Consequences Creed) against The Motor City Machine Guns (Chris Sabin and Alex Shelley) and Sheik Abdul Bashir. A the end of the match, Lethal was able to get the win for his team by pinning Bashir with a sunset flip.

The next match was the Monster's Ball match between Taylor Wilde and Daffney (with Abyss in her corner). Both women exchanged weapons shots before Wilde was able to get a pinfall victory over Daffney after using a fireman's carry takeover to throw Daffney onto a trash can. Following the match, Abyss' storyline therapist, Dr. Stevie, came down to the ring with a bag filled with thumbtacks and demanded Abyss to throw Wilde onto the contents of the bag that were spilled onto the mat. After some influence from Lauren, an interviewer for TNA with personal ties to both Wilde and Abyss, he turned on Stevie by chokeslamming him onto the thumbtacks.

Daniels challenged Suicide for the TNA X Division Championship after he saved Suicide from an attack a week prior on Impact! by the Motor City Machineguns. During their match, the Motor City Machineguns, who were determined to reveal the identity of Suicide, attacked him before fleeing the ring. Daniels did not realize the attack had occurred and pinned his opponent. Once he saw a replay, he refused to accept the title under the circumstances. He requested the match continue, adding five minutes, which expired, leading to Suicide retaining the title.

Following was a second title match for the TNA Women's Knockout Championship, which pitted Angelina Love, the champion, against Awesome Kong. During the match, Love repeatedly ran from Kong before being blocked by Kong's manager, Raisha Saeed. Kong took the opportunity beat down on her opponent before the referee was distracted. Love then grabbed a can of hair spray and sprayed it into Kong's eyes and capitalized on her opponent's compromised state by executing a roll up-style cover to get the pinfall victory. Following the match, Kong recovered from the attack and performed her signature drop, the Implant Buster, driving Love's face into the mat, before the leaving the ring.

Next was the match between Samoa Joe and Kevin Nash. Joe won the match by applying a choke with a half nelson hold. After the victory, he continued to beat on Nash with elbow strikes before several officials came to the ring to break them up.

Main event matches
The finals for the ""Team 3D Invitational Tag Team Tournament"" was the first of the main event matches, and Beer Money, Inc. was wrestling against The British Invasion (Brutus Magnus and Doug Williams). Storm performed a headscissors takedown from the top rope on Williams followed by a top rope body press by Roode to his downed opponent. Roode pinned Williams to with the match for Beer Money, Inc. after the latter was hit in the face with one of the briefcases that The British Invasion had recently commandeered.

Following this match was the ""I Quit"" match for the TNA Legends Championship between A.J. Styles and Booker T with his wife, Sharmell, in his corner. At the beginning of the match, Booker took Styles to the outside of the ring, dropping him throat-first onto the guardrail; every time the referee gave him the microphone, a way for the wrestler to say, ""I quit"", Styles would not speak. Styles reversed the momentum with a backflip kick, called the Pelé Kick, to Booker's face. For the finish to the match, Styles locked in an armbar on Booker whilst in mid-air; Booker's reluctant ally in the Main Event Mafia, Jenna Morasca, came to the ring and threw a towel in the ring, signifying Booker's concession.

The TNA World Heavyweight Championship match between defending champion Mick Foley, Kurt Angle, Jeff Jarrett, and Sting was next. The match quickly turned into a brawl on the outside of the ring and the entrance ramp. During the match, Foley decided to take a rest and started doing commentary while all three of his opponents continued to wrestle. Fellow members of the Main Event Mafia, Angle and Sting, double teamed Jarrett before a communications breakdown, leading to the two fighting each other. After Sting was taken down, Angle turned his attention to Foley at the announcers table, diving onto him. Foley returned to the ring and applied a claw hold to the jaw on both Sting and Jarrett, attempting a dual submission. The match ended when Jarrett dropped Angle from the second turnbuckle with his finishing maneuver, the Stroke, onto a chair. Meanwhile, Sting sneaked into the ring and pinned Angle, winning the match. As a result of the pre-match stipulation, Sting became the leader of the Main Event Mafia.

Aftermath
With Sting as the new leader of the Main Event Mafia, he immediately made some changes to the line up of the organization. Sharmell and Jenna Morasca were banned and Kurt Angle's bodyguards were fired.

Upon winning the ""Team 3D Invitational Tag Team Tournament"", Team 3D met with Beer Money, Inc. on the May 29 edition of Impact!. Robert Roode and James Storm received their check for $100,000 and trophies for winning the tournament. It was subsequently announced that the match guaranteed to the winners for the TNA World Tag Team Championship would take place at TNA's seventh anniversary event, Slammiversary.

The TNA World Heavyweight Champion Mick Foley's was simultaneously also the winner of the last King of the Mountain match, which he also had to defend. He began lobbying to only have to defend his title once a year.

Continuing their quest to reveal the identity of Suicide, The Motor City Machine Guns and Lethal Consequences assaulted Suicide again in the coming weeks. It was announced on the June 4 edition of Impact! that all five men would compete in another King of the Mountain match at Slammiversary.

Reception
The show was given positive feedback from critics. Dave Meltzer, writer of the professional wrestling periodical, The Wrestling Observer Newsletter, said multiple times in his pay-per-view report for the show that it, ""overachieved"", and he gave special attention to the ""Team 3D Invitational Tag Team Tournament"" finals and the ""I quit"" match. The only form of criticism he gave the show were some of the illogical booking tactics made by the company. The Pro Wrestling Torch reporter, James Caldwell, gave the show a generally good review, but also criticized the show in a number of spots, specifically the ""I quit"" match: ""Best match of the PPV until the finish with Sharmell-Jenna continuing their feud on PPV TV. Keep it on free TV (if TNA is so adamant about continuing this), but don't put that dumb storyline on pay TV. As usual, TNA tries to find a way out of a stipulation. Sucks to rant on that, because the match was awesome and one of Booker's best performances in years.""

A common theme amongst the criticism was the ""lack of common sense"", as wrestling journalist, Ben Miller, put it. He made particular mention to the World title match, by saying, ""...there was no reason for Jarrett, Angle or Foley to attempt to beat Sting. You can win a championship, control of the company, leadership of a powerful faction or... what? If you end Sting’s career do you become six-time WCW World Heavyweight Champion. There is, of course, the argument that by pinning Sting you eliminate a potential rival. I don’t think the crowd bought that argument. The heat was spotty during the match and the lack of a sensible reason for attacking Sting appeared to be a big part of it. TNA Sacrifice 2009 felt flat, but it shouldn’t have. Most everyone worked hard, some angles paid off and some angles left fans intrigued. Those three ingredients usually make for a good show. Instead, one-third of the matches had conceptual problems..."".

3070,['Generation Whose ?'],"Heresy were a hardcore punk band from Nottingham, England, formed in 1985 and active until late 1989. They released three albums and recorded three sessions for John Peel's BBC Radio 1 show.

History
The band was formed by Reevsy (guitar, vocals), Kalvin ""Kalv"" Piper (bass), and Steve Charlesworth (drums), the first two having previously been in the Stoke-on-Trent band Plasmid. Their first release was the 1986 6-track flexi-disc Never Healed - the first release on Earache Records, which was followed by a split LP with Concrete Sox. They then added a singer, who was soon replaced by Concrete Sox drummer John March. Reevsy left the band to be replaced by Mitch Dickinson from Unseen Terror on guitar. The band toured through Europe with this line-up.

In 1988, Mitch left the band, to be replaced by Baz from Ripcord, the new line-up recording the Face Up to It LP. The band's final album, 1989's 13 Rocking Anthems, was compiled from their last two Peel Sessions. The band split up in late 1988. Members Steve and Kalv formed Meatfly, and now play in UK hardcore band Geriatric Unit.

Musical style
Heresy's early material merged influences from English hardcore punk groups like Discharge and American extreme metal bands like Metallica and Slayer. A fusion which led to them being categorised as crust punk. By the time their founding vocalist Malcolm Reeves was replaced by Kalvin Piper, they had stripped away the metal influence, for a thrashcore sound influenced by Boston hardcore, early-Dirty Rotten Imbeciles and Siege. An article for Alternative Press described how ""no band before them, harnessed the hormonal force of American hardcore and spiked it with metal-tipped UK82 punk"". Simon Czerwinskyj, in an article for Bandcamp Daily, described the band as ""proto-grind crust maniacs"".

The  program aired in black-and-white and, then as of October 1967, in color.

The show began with a marching theme, with the narrator saying: ""In, Out, and Round About. Here, There, and Everywhere. What's New?""

The target audience was upper elementary school and junior high school grades.  The show was hosted by Al Binford, with daily segments presented by science teacher George Fischbeck, naturalist Murl Deusing and others, including deaf mime actor Bernard Bragg whose silent semi-comical educational adventure sketches were based on the artistry of his teacher, Marcel Marceau. Ron Finley created the opening credits.  Each program would deal with three different topics, such as baseball or space science.

3129,"['Profit It Shall What "" , title original the intended Thoreau ?']","""Life Without Principle"" is an essay by Henry David Thoreau that offers his program for a righteous livelihood. It was published in 1863.

Overview 
In his essay, Thoreau questions whether working is the most important part of one's life, arguing that work is often at odds with poetry and living. He notes that, when he saw his neighbor in the early morning leading a team of oxen, he at first felt guilty because he was watching from the comfort of his home. However, later he saw the result of the laborer's work--a bit of useless yard art, and his opinion changed. He argues that work ought to be worthwhile, and he insists that he has no need for the ""police of meaningless labor"" to tell him how to spend his time.

""All great enterprises are self supporting. The poet, for instance, must sustain his body by his poetry, as the boiler in the wood-cutting mill is fed with the shavings it creates. You must get your living by loving."" In his own occasional work as a surveyor, he noticed that, when presented with different methods of surveying a piece of land, the owner would ask which method would give the owner the most land rather than which was the most accurate way to do it. 

He talks of the constant motion of work and business and how people value making-money above all else. Overall, the essay provides a cogent overview of Thoreau's philosophy of work and life.

Composition and publication history
On October 18th, 1855, Thoreau was invited to participate in a series of lectures on reform at the Railroad Hall in Providence, Rhode Island. With little time to prepare, he searched his journals for inspiration. He found a passage he had written on September 7th, 1851: ""I do not so much wish to know how to economize time as how to spent it, by what means to grow rich, that the day may not have been in vain."" After some re-working, the end result was a lecture delivered on December 6th, 1855, which he titled ""What Shall It Profit?"". The title, before it was altered to ""Life Without Principle"", referenced a verse in the Gospel of Mark, 8:36. Thoreau later revised his notes and delivered the lecture under the title ""Life Misspent"".

Thoreau prepared ""Life Without Principle"" for publication during the final months of his life based on his journal notes between 1851 and 1855 that originally inspired his lecture. It was published posthumously in 1863. In addition to ""Life Without Principle"", Thoreau was either writing or re-working several other lectures and essays for publication in the final months of his life, including ""Walking"", ""Wild Apples"", and ""Autumnal Tints"".

Analysis 
Thoreau intended the original title, ""What Shall It Profit?"", as a Biblical reference (""For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?""). A few lines earlier, Mark 8:33, Jesus turns to Peter and says, ""Get thee behind me, Satan; for thou savorest not the things that be of God, but the things that be of man."" Thoreau originally alluded to this line as well in the earlier version of his lecture, referencing the California Gold Rush: ""Satan, from one of his elevations, showed mankind the kingdom of California, and instead of the cry 'Get thee behind me, Satan,' they shouted, 'Go ahead!' and he had to exert himself to get there first"".

Scholar Barbara Packer notes that Thoreau's shifting titles show his shifting pity and contempt for his contemporaries who he felt were employed in ways that degraded life or the country.

Other themes and lessons from Thoreau:
 Don't cheat people by conspiring with them to protect their comfort zones.
 Don't make religions and other such institutions the sort of intellectual comfort zone that prevents you from entertaining ideas that aren't to be found there.
 Don't cheat yourself by working primarily for a paycheck. If what you do with your life free-of-charge is so worthless to you that you'd be convinced to do something else in exchange for a little money or fame, you need better hobbies.
 Furthermore, don't hire someone who's only in it for the money. They should be passionate about their work.
 Sustain yourself by the life you live, not by exchanging your life for money and living off that.
 It is a shame to be living off an inheritance, charity, a government pension, or to gamble your way to prosperity—either through a lottery or by such means as prospecting for gold.
 Remember that what is valuable about a thing is not the same as how much money it will fetch on the market.
 Don't waste conversation and attention on the superficial trivialities and gossip of the daily news, but attend to things of more import: ""Read not the Times. Read the Eternities.""
 Similarly, politics is something that ought to be a minor and discreet part of life, not the grotesque public sport it has become.
 Don't mistake the march of commerce for progress and civilization—especially when that commerce amounts to driving slaves to produce the articles of vice like alcohol and tobacco. There's no shortage of gold, of tobacco, of alcohol, but there is a short supply of ""a high and earnest purpose.""
Live righteous and worthy lives that are not based on monetary gain.
Live a life driven by virtue instead of by money.

Essays by Henry David Thoreau"
3156,"[""It 's Shift Who ( 3 Game and ) Shift Memory ( 2 Game , games memory two has Shift Brain ?""]","Simon is an electronic game of short-term memory skill invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison, working for a toy design firm Marvin Glass and Associates, with software programming by Lenny Cope. The device creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence. If the user succeeds, the series becomes progressively longer and more complex. Once the user fails or the time limit runs out, the game is over. The original version was manufactured and distributed by Milton Bradley and later by Hasbro after it took over Milton Bradley. Much of the assembly language code was written by Charles Kapps, who taught computer science at Temple University and also wrote one of the first books on the theory of computer programming. Simon was launched in 1978 at Studio 54 in New York City and was an immediate success, becoming a pop culture symbol of the 1970s and 1980s.

History
Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison were introduced to Atari's arcade game Touch Me at the Music Operators of America (MOA) trade show in 1976. Baer said of the product, ""Nice gameplay. Terrible execution. Visually boring. Miserable, rasping sounds."" The prototype built by Baer used the low-cost Texas Instruments TMS 1000 microcontroller chip, which was in many games of the 1970s. Lenny Cope, who was one of Ralph H. Baer's partners, programmed the core of the game, titled Follow Me at the time. Baer developed the tones of the game, inspired by the notes of a bugle. When they pitched the demo, an 8-by-8-inch console, to the Milton Bradley Company the name of the game was changed to Simon. Simon debuted in 1978 at a retail price of $24.95 () and became one of the top-selling toys that Christmas. : ""Microcomputer controlled game"", was granted in 1980. Milton Bradley soon capitalized on the original with both the smaller-sized Pocket Simon and the expanded, eight-button Super Simon.

Many variants of Simon have been made since Hasbro acquired Milton Bradley in the 1980s, building on the possibilities offered by advances in technology. The original Super Simon was reinvented in 2003 as a hexagonal unit with six buttons, which was only released in Europe. 2000 saw Simon Squared (or Simon2), a unit with the four traditional buttons on one side, and a set of eight smaller buttons on the other. In 2004, Hasbro released the Simon Stix. The game features two electronic sticks (modeled after drumsticks), an emphasis on the musical part of the game, and features four levels of play.

In 2005, Hasbro released Simon Trickster (also known as Simon Tricks in Europe and in the UK, and as Simon Genius in Brazil), which features four game modes, in a similar fashion to another Hasbro game, Bop It, and colored lenses instead of buttons. ""Simon Classic"" mode plays up to 35 tones (notes). ""Simon Bounce"" is similar to ""Simon Classic"", but instead the colors of the lenses change. ""Simon Surprise"" is one of the most difficult games in the unit. Every lens becomes the same color and the player has to memorize the location. ""Simon Rewind"" requires the player to memorize the sequence backwards. During each game, the player is paid a compliment after a certain number of tones is completed. On reaching five and eleven tones, the computer will randomly choose ""Awesome!"", ""Nice!"", ""Sweet!"" or ""Respect!"". On reaching 18 tones, the game will play a victory melody three times. On reaching the ultimate 35 tones, the game will play the victory melody again and will say ""Respect!"". If the player fails to memorize the pattern or fails to press the right color within the time limit, the game will play a crashing sound and the game will say ""Later!"".

In 2011, Hasbro introduced Simon Flash. In this version, the game is played with four cube-shaped electronic modules that the player must move around depending on the game mode.

In 2013, Hasbro reinvented Simon once again with Simon Swipe. The game was demonstrated at the New York Toy Fair 2014 and released that summer. The game is a circular unit that looks like a steering wheel. It has been extended from four buttons to eight touchscreen buttons, which are flattened out on the unit. The game features four game modes, called ""Levels"" (the main game), ""Classic"", ""Party"" and ""Extreme"". The player has to go through all sixteen levels to beat the game. ""Classic"", ""Party"" and ""Extreme"" levels focus on one pattern getting longer and longer until the player is out. A smaller version of the game, called Simon Micro Series, was introduced in the fall of 2014. This version has only two game modes called ""Solo"" and ""Pass It"" and features 14 levels and four buttons. There is also a version of Simon created by Basic Fun known as the Touch Simon. This version has an LCD screen and plays melodies at specific parts of the game.

In 2016, Hasbro launched the follow-up to Simon Swipe with Simon Air. The game was announced at a Hasbro press conference before the 2016 New York Toy Fair. This version of Simon uses motion sensors, similar to those in Mattel's Loopz line of games. The game has three game modes: ""Solo"", ""Classic"" and ""Multiplayer"". A button-pressing version of Simon was also released in the US, with an aesthetic recalling that of the 1970s and 1980s models. Recently, Hasbro has released Simon Optix, a headset game with a motion sensor technology similar to Simon Air.

Gameplay
The device has four colored buttons, each producing a particular tone when it is pressed or activated by the device. A round in the game consists of the device lighting up one or more buttons in a random order, after which the player must reproduce that order by pressing the buttons. As the game progresses, the number of buttons to be pressed increases. (This is only one of the games on the device; there are actually other games on the original.)

Simon is named after the simple children's game of Simon Says, but the gameplay is based on Atari's unpopular Touch Me arcade game from 1974. Simon differs from Touch Me in that the Touch Me buttons were all of the same color (black) and the sounds it produced were harsh and grating.

Simon'''s tones, on the other hand, were designed to always be harmonic, no matter the sequence, and consisted of an A major triad in second inversion, resembling a trumpet fanfare:
 E-note (blue, lower right);
 C♯-note (yellow, lower left);
 A-note (red, upper right).
 E-note (green, upper left, an octave lower than blue);Simon was later re-released by Milton Bradley – now owned by Hasbro – in its original circular form, though with a translucent case rather than plain black. It was also sold as a two-sided Simon Squared version, with the reverse side having eight buttons for head-to-head play, and as a keychain (officially licensed by Fun4All) with simplified gameplay (only having Game 1, Difficulty 4 available). Other variations of the original game, no longer produced, include Pocket Simon and the eight-button Super Simon, both from 1980. Nelsonic released an official wristwatch version of Simon.

Later versions of the game included a pocket version of the original game in a smaller, yellow, oval-shaped case. Another iteration, Simon Trickster, plays the original game as well as variations in which the colors shift around from button to button (Simon Bounce), the buttons have no colors at all (Simon Surprise) and the player must repeat the sequence backwards (Simon Rewind). A pocket version of Simon Trickster was also produced.

In the 2014 version of Simon called Simon Swipe, the notes are as follows: 
 G-note (blue, lower right);
 C-note (yellow, lower left);
 E-note (red, upper right).
 G-note (green, upper left, an octave higher than blue)

The swiping sounds are presented with sliding between notes. The bigger the slide, the bigger the swipe will be. The exact notes and sound effects were also used for a smaller version called Simon Micro Series. The sounds were then recreated for Simon Air and Simon Optix.

Clones
As a popular game, Simon inspired many imitators and knockoffs. Atari released a handheld version of Touch Me in 1978, with multicolored buttons and pleasant musical tones. Though named for the older arcade game, the handheld Touch Me contained Simon's three game variations and four difficulty levels, albeit with limits of 8, 16, 32 and 99 instead of 8, 14, 20 and 31. Even its button layout mirrored that of Simon (though upside-down), with blue in the upper left, yellow in the upper right, red in the lower left and green in the lower right. Its only unique features were an LED score display, similar to that of its arcade counterpart, and its small size, similar to that of a pocket calculator.

Other clones include:
 Monkey See, Monkey Do, which featured a similar casing as that of Simon, except that the buttons were oval-shaped.
 Tiger Electronics' Copy Cat in 1979, re-released with a transparent case in 1988 and using buzzers. 
 Repackaged and released by Sears as Follow Me.
 Released as Copy Cat Jr. in 1981, and as Pocket Repeat by Tandy Computers and Radio Shack.
 Castle Toy's Einstein in 1979.
 Genius, launched in the 80s in Brazil, by Brinquedos Estrela.
 Space Echo by an unknown company.
 Makezine has a DIY version that requires soldering.
 Another DIY version called Electronic Memory Game based on ARM Cortex microcontrollers
 The ""Game A"" mode of the second game in the Game & Watch handheld series Flagman (Silver, 5th Jun 1980). ""Game B"" is the same, but doesn't play in a sequence, while the player has a limited time to press the corresponding number lit up.
 R2-D2 Ditto Droid, a Star Wars version featuring R2-D2 sounds and Star Wars-themed graphics by Tiger Electronics, 1997.
 Vtech's Wizard. A side quest in both the SNES and Game Boy Advance versions of Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kong's Double Trouble! that involves freeing creatures called ""Banana Birds"" using buttons on each system's controller.
 Soviet Elektronika IE-01 Ivolga, nearly an exact visual replica of Simon.
Oddworld games, in which the playable character must progress by completing certain puzzles with a sequence of sounds.

The same gameplay also appears on multi-game handhelds such as:
Tiger Electronics' Brain Warp and Brain Shift games: instead of tones, the game unit issues a recorded voice that calls out colors and numbers in Game 4 - Memory Match. Brain Shift has two memory games, Game 2 (Memory Shift) and Game 3 (Who Shift's It?), that call out colors. 
 Mego Corporation's Fabulous Fred (Game 3, The Memory Game).
 Parker Brothers' Merlin (Game 3, Echo).
 Atari also included a nine-button version of Touch Me as game variations 1-4 (out of 19) on the 1978 Brain Games cartridge for the Atari 2600.
 A fan-made version of Simon was unofficially made available for modded Wiis in 2008.
 A Harry Potter wand released in 2001 called Harry Potter Magic Spell Challenge had Simon gameplay and voice commands: ""Wingardium"" (to tilt the wand down) and ""Leviosa"" (to tilt the wand up.).
 Toytronic's GOTCHA!, a similar handheld with 8 buttons instead of 4, produced in a rounded ""big"" version and a smaller, ""pocket"" one

Audio
Some versions of the game have tones that play as long as the button is depressed, but others have a constant sound duration. Some versions feature audio themes, such as animals (cat/dog/pig/cow), xylophone, football and space sounds, some of which make the game easier to play. Some versions also have a sound on/off setting, which can make the game harder with only visual cues.

In popular culture
 In the 1987 Stephen King novel The Tommyknockers, a forgotten Simon game left in the back seat of a reporter's car activates itself and, in an accelerated color-switching frenzy, overheats and melts its casing, scorching the seat beneath. The surprised driver then knocks it to the floor before it goes up in flames.

3160,['Germans use Why ?'],"The terms German Prince or German Princess are often used to refer to members of royalty that were from a German state. Today Germany is one nation, but until 1914, Germany and Central Europe were ruled over by a large number of independent states. Until World War I, the term German could have referred to peoples from areas of what is today the states Germany, Poland, Belgium, Luxembourg, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Austria, and even Croatia, and the Netherlands. From 1815 to 1860 this number was 35 separate German sovereign states (including Prussia and Austria) plus another 4 free cities, who together formed the German Confederation. Prior to 1789 there were over 300 independent sovereign states and thousands of other bishoprics, lordships, and free cities that made up the Holy Roman Empire.

Why use Germans? 
When the term German Prince or Princess is used, it is referring to a member of one of the many ruling sovereign houses of the Central Europe region. They were often used as suitable marriage candidates, simply due to the fact there were so many of them. Also, as all of the European royalty were related, it helped to use a German prince/princess to keep the marriage ""in the family"", so to speak, or sometimes the opposite: to broaden the gene pool. The only other area of Europe that was close to be being ruled over by so many different sovereign states was Italy which after 1815 was made up of at least 11 different states, with the rest of Europe being ruled over by large states.

Examples 
 King George I was a German Prince, the Elector of Hanover, before and after he became King of Great Britain.
 Queen Mary of United Kingdom, queen consort of King George V. She was originally the Princess of Teck, a small principality in Württemberg, and was married in 1893.
 Queen Caroline of United Kingdom, queen consort of George IV. She was originally the Princess of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, and married her first cousin in 1795.
 Empress Catherine II of Russia, better known as Catherine the Great. She was born Princess Sophia Augusta Frederica of Anhalt-Zerbst, from Stettin in Prussia, marrying the future Emperor Peter III of Russia in 1745.  In 1762, she replaced her husband as ruler of Russia, after a bloodless palace coup.
 Queen Anne Catherine of Denmark and Norway, queen consort of King Christian IV of Denmark. She was originally Anne Catherine of Brandenburg, in 1597 marrying King Christian IV, becoming Queen.

3205,['normal be Why ?'],"Linguistic anthropology is the interdisciplinary study of how language influences social life. It is a branch of anthropology that originated from the endeavor to document endangered languages and has grown over the past century to encompass most aspects of language structure and use.

Linguistic anthropology explores how language shapes communication, forms social identity and group membership, organizes large-scale cultural beliefs and ideologies, and develops a common cultural representation of natural and social worlds.

Historical Development
Linguistic anthropology emerged from the development of three distinct paradigms that have set the standard for approaching linguistic anthropology. The first, now known as ""anthropological linguistics,"" focuses on the documentation of languages. The second, known as ""linguistic anthropology,"" engages in theoretical studies of language use. The third, developed over the past two or three decades, studies issues from other subfields of anthropology with linguistic considerations. Though they developed sequentially, all three paradigms are still practiced today.

First Paradigm: Anthropological Linguistics

The first paradigm, anthropological linguistics, is devoted to themes unique to the sub-discipline. This area includes documentation of languages that have been seen as at-risk for extinction, with a particular focus on indigenous languages of native North American tribes. It is also the paradigm most focused on linguistics. Linguistic themes include the following:

 Grammatical description,
Typological classification and
Linguistic relativity

Second Paradigm: Linguistic Anthropology
The second paradigm can be marked by reversing the words. Going from anthropological linguistics to linguistic anthropology, signals a more anthropological focus on the study. This term was preferred by Dell Hymes, who was also responsible, with John Gumperz, for the idea of ethnography of communication.  The term linguistic anthropology reflected Hymes' vision of a future where language would be studied in the context of the situation and relative to the community speaking it. This new era would involve many new technological developments, such as mechanical recording.

This paradigm developed in critical dialogue with the fields of folklore on the one hand and linguistics on the other. Hymes criticized folklorists' fixation on oral texts rather than the verbal artistry of performance. At the same time, he criticized the cognitivist shift in linguistics heralded by the pioneering work of Noam Chomsky, arguing for an ethnographic focus on language in use.    

Hymes had many revolutionary contributions to linguistic anthropology, the first of which was a new unit of analysis. Unlike the first paradigm, which focused on linguistic tools like measuring of phonemes and morphemes, the second paradigm's unit of analysis was the ""speech event"". A speech event is defined as one with speech presented for a significant duration throughout its occurrence (ex., a lecture or debate). This is different from a speech situation, where speech could possibly occur (ex., dinner). Hymes also pioneered a linguistic anthropological approach to ethnopoetics. Hymes had hoped that this paradigm would link linguistic anthropology more to anthropology. However, Hymes' ambition backfired as the second paradigm marked a distancing of the sub-discipline from the rest of anthropology.

Third Paradigm: Anthropological Issues Studied via Linguistic Methods and Data 
The third paradigm, which began in the late 1980s, redirected the primary focus on anthropology by providing a linguistic approach to anthropological issues. Rather than prioritizing the technical components of language, third paradigm anthropologists focus on studying culture through the use of linguistic tools. Themes include:

 investigations of personal and social identities
 shared ideologies
 construction of narrative interactions among individuals

Furthermore, similar to how the second paradigm used new technology in its studies, the third paradigm heavily includes use of video documentation to support research.

Areas of Interest 
Contemporary linguistic anthropology continues research in all three paradigms described above:

 Documentation of languages
 Study of language through context
 The study of identity through linguistic means

The third paradigm, the study of anthropological issues through linguistic means, is an affluent area of study for current linguistic anthropologists.

Identity and Intersubjectivity
A great deal of work in linguistic anthropology investigates questions of sociocultural identity linguistically and discursively. Linguistic anthropologist Don Kulick has done so in relation to identity, for example, in a series of settings, first in a village called Gapun in northern Papua New Guinea. He explored how the use of two languages with and around children in Gapun village: the traditional language (Taiap), not spoken anywhere but in their own village and thus primordially ""indexical"" of Gapuner identity, and Tok Pisin, the widely circulating official language of New Guinea. (""indexical"" points to meanings beyond the immediate context.) To speak the Taiap language is associated with one identity: not only local but ""Backward"" and also an identity based on the display of *hed* (personal autonomy). To speak Tok Pisin is to index a modern, Christian (Catholic) identity, based not on *hed* but on *save*, an identity linked with the will and the skill to cooperate. In later work, Kulick demonstrates that certain loud speech performances in Brazil called *um escândalo*, Brazilian travesti (roughly, 'transvestite') sex workers shame clients. The travesti community, the argument goes, ends up at least making a powerful attempt to transcend the shame the larger Brazilian public might try to foist off on them, again by loud public discourse and other modes of performance.

In addition, scholars such as Émile Benveniste, Mary Bucholtz and Kira Hall Benjamin Lee, Paul Kockelman, and Stanton Wortham (among many others) have contributed to understandings of identity as ""intersubjectivity"" by examining the ways it is discursively constructed.

Socialization
In a series of studies, linguistic anthropologists Elinor Ochs and Bambi Schieffelin addressed the anthropological topic of socialization (the process by which infants, children, and foreigners become members of a community, learning to participate in its culture), using linguistic and other ethnographic methods. They discovered that the processes of enculturation and socialization do not occur apart from the process of language acquisition, but that children acquire language and culture together in what amounts to an integrated process. Ochs and Schieffelin demonstrated that baby talk is not universal, that the direction of adaptation (whether the child is made to adapt to the ongoing situation of speech around it or vice versa) was a variable that correlated, for example, with the direction it was held vis-à-vis a caregiver's body. In many societies caregivers hold a child facing outward so as to orient it to a network of kin whom it must learn to recognize early in life.

Ochs and Schieffelin demonstrated that members of all societies socialize children both to and through the use of language. Ochs and Schieffelin uncovered how, through naturally occurring stories told during dinners in white middle class households in Southern California, both mothers and fathers participated in replicating male dominance (the ""father knows best"" syndrome) by the distribution of participant roles such as protagonist (often a child but sometimes mother and almost never the father) and ""problematizer"" (often the father, who raised uncomfortable questions or challenged the competence of the protagonist). When mothers collaborated with children to get their stories told, they unwittingly set themselves up to be subject to this process.

Schieffelin's more recent research has uncovered the socializing role of pastors and other fairly new Bosavi converts in the Southern Highlands, Papua New Guinea community she studies. Pastors have introduced new ways of conveying knowledge,  new linguistic epistemic markers—and new ways of speaking about time. And they have struggled with and largely resisted those parts of the Bible that speak of being able to know the inner states of others (e.g. the gospel of Mark, chapter 2, verses 6–8).

Ideologies
In a third example of the current (third) paradigm, since Roman Jakobson's student Michael Silverstein opened the way, there has been an increase in the work done by linguistic anthropologists on the major anthropological theme of ideologies,—in this case ""language ideologies"", sometimes defined as ""shared bodies of commonsense notions about the nature of language in the world."" Silverstein has demonstrated that these ideologies are not mere false consciousness but actually influence the evolution of linguistic structures, including the dropping of ""thee"" and ""thou"" from everyday English usage. Woolard, in her overview of ""code switching"", or the systematic practice of alternating linguistic varieties within a conversation or even a single utterance, finds the underlying question anthropologists ask of the practice—Why do they do that?—reflects a dominant linguistic ideology. It is the ideology that people should ""really"" be monoglot and efficiently targeted toward referential clarity rather than diverting themselves with the messiness of multiple varieties in play at a single time.

Much research on linguistic ideologies probes subtler influences on language, such as the pull exerted on Tewa, a Kiowa-Tanoan language spoken in certain New Mexican pueblos and on the Hopi Reservation in Arizona, by ""kiva speech"", discussed in the next section.

Other linguists have carried out research in the areas of language contact, language endangerment, and 'English as a global language'. For instance, Indian linguist Braj Kachru investigated local varieties of English in South Asia, the ways in which English functions as a lingua franca among multicultural groups in India. British linguist David Crystal has contributed to investigations of language death attention to the effects of cultural assimilation resulting in the spread of one dominant language in situations of colonialism.

Heritage Language Ideologies
More recently, a new line of ideology work is beginning to enter the field of linguistics in relation to heritage languages. Specifically, applied linguist Martin Guardado has posited that heritage language ideologies are ""somewhat fluid sets of understandings, justifications, beliefs, and judgments that linguistic minorities hold about their languages.""<ref name=Guardado>Guardado, Martin. 2018. "" Discourse, Ideology and Heritage Language Socialization: Micro and Macro Perspectives. New York & Berlin: De Gruyter Mouton.</ref> Guardado goes on to argue that ideologies of heritage languages also contain the expectations and desires of linguistic minority families ""regarding the relevance of these languages in their children’s lives as well as when, where, how, and to what ends these languages should be used."" Although  this is arguably a fledgling line of language ideology research, this work is poised to contribute to the understanding of how ideologies of language operate in a variety of settings.

Social Space
In a final example of this third paradigm, a group of linguistic anthropologists have done very creative work on the idea of social space. Duranti published a groundbreaking article on Samoan greetings and their use and transformation of social space. Before that, Indonesianist Joseph Errington, making use of earlier work by Indonesianists not necessarily concerned with language issues per se, brought linguistic anthropological methods (and semiotic theory) to bear on the notion of the exemplary center, the center of political and ritual power from which emanated exemplary behavior. Errington demonstrated how the Javanese *priyayi*, whose ancestors served at the Javanese royal courts, became emissaries, so to speak, long after those courts had ceased to exist, representing throughout Java the highest example of ""refined speech."" The work of Joel Kuipers develops this theme vis-a-vis the island of Sumba, Indonesia. And, even though it pertains to Tewa Indians in Arizona rather than Indonesians, Paul Kroskrity's argument that speech forms originating in the Tewa kiva (or underground ceremonial space) forms the dominant model for all Tewa speech can be seen as a direct parallel.

Silverstein tries to find the maximum theoretical significance and applicability in this idea of exemplary centers. He feels, in fact, that the exemplary center idea is one of linguistic anthropology's three most important findings. He generalizes the notion thus, arguing ""there are wider-scale institutional 'orders of interactionality,' historically contingent yet structured. Within such large-scale, macrosocial orders, in-effect ritual centers of semiosis come to exert a structuring, value-conferring influence on any particular event of discursive interaction with respect to the meanings and significance of the verbal and other semiotic forms used in it."" Current approaches to such classic anthropological topics as ritual by linguistic anthropologists emphasize not static linguistic structures but the unfolding in realtime of a hypertrophic' set of parallel orders of iconicity and indexicality that seem to cause the ritual to create its own sacred space through what appears, often, to be the magic of textual and nontextual metricalizations, synchronized.""Wilce, James M. 2006. Magical Laments and Anthropological Reflections: The Production and Circulation of Anthropological Text as Ritual Activity. Current Anthropology. 47(6):891–914.

Race, Class, and Gender
Addressing the broad central concerns of the subfield and drawing from its core theories, many scholars focus on the intersections of language and the particularly salient social constructs of race (and ethnicity), class, and gender (and sexuality). These works generally consider the roles of social structures (e.g., ideologies and institutions) related to race, class, and gender (e.g., marriage, labor, pop culture, education) in terms of their constructions and in terms of individuals' lived experiences.

Ethnopoetics

Ethnopoetics is a method of recording text versions of oral poetry or narrative performances (i.e. verbal lore) that uses poetic lines, verses, and stanzas (instead of prose paragraphs) to capture the formal, poetic performance elements which would otherwise be lost in the written texts. The goal of any ethnopoetic text is to show how the techniques of unique oral performers enhance the aesthetic value of their performances within their specific cultural contexts. Major contributors to ethnopoetic theory include Jerome Rothenberg, Dennis Tedlock, and Dell Hymes. Ethnopoetics is considered a subfield of ethnology, anthropology, folkloristics, stylistics, linguistics, and literature and translation studies.

 Endangered Languages: Language Documentation and Revitalization 
Endangered languages are languages that are not being passed down to children as their mother tongue or that have declining numbers of speakers for a variety of reasons. Therefore, after a couple generations these languages may no longer be spoken. Anthropologists have been involved with endangered language communities through their involvement in language documentation and revitalization projects. 

In a language documentation project, researchers work to develop records of the language - these records could be field notes and audio or video recordings. To follow best practices of documentation, these records should be clearly annotated and kept safe within an archive of some kind. Franz Boas was one of the first anthropologists involved in language documentation within North America and he supported the development of three key materials: 1) grammars, 2) texts, and 3) dictionaries. This is now known as the Boasian Trilogy. 

Language revitalization is the practice of bringing a language back into common use. The revitalization efforts can take the form of teaching the language to new speakers or encouraging the continued use within the community. One example of a language revitalization project is the Lenape language course taught at Swathmore College, Pennsylvania. The course aims to educate indigenous and non-indigenous students about the Lenape language and culture. 

Language reclamation, as a subset of revitalization, implies that a language has been taken away from a community and addresses their concern in taking back the agency to revitalize their language on their own terms. Language reclamation addresses the power dynamics associated with language loss. Encouraging those who already know the language to use it, increasing the domains of usage, and increasing the overall prestige of the language are all components of reclamation. One example of this is the Miami language being brought back from 'extinct' status through extensive archives. 

While the field of linguistics has also been focused on the study of the linguistic structures of endangered languages, anthropologists also contribute to this field through their emphasize on ethnographic understandings of the socio-historical context of language endangerment, but also of language revitalization and reclamation projects.

Applied linguistics"
3211,"[""here out you left I if say dad your would What ' , says He ?""]","Home and Away is an Australian television soap opera. It was first broadcast on the Seven Network on 17 January 1988. The following is a list of characters that first appeared in 2011, by order of first appearance. All characters were introduced by the shows series producer Cameron Welsh. The 24th season of Home and Away began airing on 24 January 2011. The following month, the Braxton brothers; Darryl, Heath and Casey were introduced.  Miranda Jacobs and Kieran Monroe made their debuts in April. Marty Jones made his debut in June and Tegan Callahan arrived the following month. Fletcher Humphrys joined the cast in July as Gang Member Jake Pirovic. August saw the introductions of Harvey Ryan, Hammer, Stu Henderson and Sasha Bezmel. Shane Emmett made his debut as Mark Gilmour in September and lawyer Hayley O'Connor began appearing from October.

Darryl Braxton

Darryl ""Brax"" Braxton, played by Steve Peacocke, made his first screen appearance on 16 February 2011. The character and casting was announced on 9 January 2011. Peacocke heard about the role from his agent and he called the audition process ""a lot of fun"". Brax is the oldest of three brothers known as The River Boys, a ""bad-boy surf gang with dodgy reputations."" A writer for Channel Seven's Home and Away website stated that Brax has a ""dodgy reputation and a chip on his shoulder."" He is a surfing legend and commands a respect from his fellow surfies, which he finds useful. Peacocke commented that Brax just wants to escape his upbringing and have a successful family life. Brax tries to keep his younger brothers Heath (Dan Ewing) and Casey (Lincoln Younes) out of trouble. Shortly after his arrival, Darryl began a relationship with Charlie Buckton (Esther Anderson). For his portrayal of Darryl, Peacocke won the Logie Award for Most Popular New Male Talent in 2012.

Heath Braxton

Heath Braxton, played by Daniel Ewing, made his first on-screen appearance on 16 February 2011, originally departed on 29 July 2014 and made a one-off appearance on 23 September 2014. Heath is the second oldest of the Braxton brothers and was initially described as being ""feared by cops and the residents of his home town of Mangrove River"" and having a short fuse. Heath was the first of The River Boys to be announced, with Ewing's casting revealed on 24 September 2010. Heath is Ewing's second role with Home and Away, having appeared as Reuben Humphries in 2007. For his role, Ewing had to get fit and he joked ""I don't think they would cast overweight guys to play surfers, so yeah, I'm sure it was a factor for the producers."" He added that he cannot surf well and was relieved that the producers did not test his surfing skills at his audition.

Casey Braxton

Casey Braxton, played by Lincoln Younes, made his first on-screen appearance on 17 February 2011 and departed on 16 September 2014. Casey is the youngest of the Braxton brothers. The Daily Telegraph said that Casey is trying to break out of the River Boys mould and that he was kicked out of his last high school. Younes was planning to go to London to travel and to find himself, but after a successful audition for Home and Away, he decided to cancel his plans to play the part of Casey. He relocated to Sydney for the role. Casey is described as being a ""modern day Rebel Without a Cause."" He has never quite fitted in and he does not know what he wants from life. He has been overshadowed by both of his brothers and he has struggled at school. Casey later begins a relationship with Ruby Buckton (Rebecca Breeds), following her fling with Romeo Smith (Luke Mitchell).

Miranda Jacobs

Miranda Jacobs, played by Ashley Cheadle, made her first on-screen appearance on 6 April 2011. Miranda comes to Summer Bay to compete in the Surf Carnival and she begins dating Xavier Austin.

It was revealed in January 2011 that Cheadle had joined the cast of Home and Away as a love interest for one of the characters. Cheadle is a professional surfer and Tania Seager of Yahoo!7 said she is ""not the standard beach blond surfer that typifies our Summer Bay culture."" Cheadle's character, Miranda, competes against Ruby Buckton (Rebecca Breeds) in the Surf Carnival and Cheadle revealed that she and Breeds did their own stunts, which she said was ""fun."" Seager said ""Miranda also sorts out the boys from the men and gives Xavier a lot to think about."" Miranda briefly dates Xavier Austin (David Jones-Roberts) and she is ""annoyed"" when she discovers that he lied to her about being in university. Miranda gives him a second chance, but Xavier manages to ""mess things up"" again. Holy Soap said that it had not been confirmed how long Miranda would be in the show.

Xavier Austin delivers pizza to Miranda's house and she flirts with him. Xavier later attends a party at Miranda's home and she assumes he is a university student. They arrange to meet her again and go to a party hosted by Ruby Buckton and Casey Braxton (Lincoln Younes). When April Scott (Rhiannon Fish) is thrown into the swimming pool, Miranda and Xavier help her out and take her home. Miranda invites Xavier to an exhibition at an art gallery and they late fall asleep on the beach. Miranda tells Xavier that she will help train him for the Surf Carnival. Gina Austin (Sonia Todd) invites Miranda to give a talk at Summer Bay High and Miranda discovers Xavier is a school student. Xavier begs Miranda for a second chance, which she agrees to. She helps him out with a pizza delivery, but when she hears him lying to Angelo Rosetta (Luke Jacobz) she tells him that he needs to grow up and leaves. On the day of the Surf Carnival, Ruby Buckton goads Miranda and during the race, Ruby deliberately tries to cut Miranda off. Miranda knocks Ruby into the water and wins the race. Ruby has a go at Miranda for cheating and Xavier stands up for her.

Kieran Monroe

Kieran Monroe, played by Andrew Hazzard, made his first on-screen appearance on 6 April 2011. Kieran was introduced as a love interest for Indigo Walker, but his attempts to win her over make him seem ""creepy"".

Hazzard said joining Home and Away was ""fun"" and that the cast and crew had been very welcoming. Hazzard described Kieran as being a ""quite a straightforward, achievement-orientated guy... in his own mind anyway."" Hazzard told Holy Soap that he saw his character as wanting to succeed at his university course and his relationship with Indigo (Samara Weaving). Kieran wants to own a farm and become a great husband and father. Hazzard also felt that Kieran has been ""messed around"" by people. Kieran meets Indigo at a party and he falls in love with her instantly. Even though she lies to him and he does not know what is happening with their relationship, Kieran cannot stop his feelings of love for her. Kieran meets Indigo's family and Hazzard said that he ""tries to be as amiable as he possibly can be. I think he feels if he makes a great impression on Indi's family, then he will have more of a chance with Indi.""

Kieran also meets Indigo's ex-boyfriend, Romeo Smith (Luke Mitchell) at the party. Hazzard said that his character ""definitely knows something has happened"" between Indigo and Romeo and Kieran wants Romeo out of his way. When asked if Kieran is dangerous, Hazzard opined that he thinks his character has a ""dangerous streak"", but he did not think Kieran would hurt Indigo. The actor explained that Kieran want to be the best he can possibly be and his emotions get the better of him. On playing a bad guy, Hazzard told the website, ""I didn't actually see Kieran as a 'bad guy'. Even in his final scene, where he is manhandling Indi out of the bushes and attempting to put her in his car, I feel that he was doing all of that with the best intentions. He says, 'What would your dad say if I left you out here?', and I feel that really was his motivation for wanting to get her back in his car. He really did just want to get her home safely."" The actor added that Kieran could appear to come across as a bad guy from the viewer's point of view, but not from his character's. He said ""He's lovesick, I think. And as we all know, sometimes love makes us do some crazy things.""

Kieran meets Indigo Walker at a party and he later sends her a flirty text. Kieran asks her out and Indigo says that she will get back to him. Romeo Smith then warns Kieran to back off. Indigo accepts Kieran's invitation for a date, but when he wants to meet up again, Indigo tells him that she is busy. Kieran shows up and Indigo's house and he helps Indigo and her brother, Dexter (Charles Cottier), put together some furniture. Indigo tells Kieran that she just got out of a relationship and she is not interested in him. Kieran appears to accept this, but when Indigo goes to a club to see a band, he turns up too. Kieran offers to drive Indigo and Nicole Franklin (Tessa James) and they accept. Kieran drops Nicole off, but tries to take Indigo somewhere else. She panics and asks him to let her out of the car. Kieran does and he drives off. He later comes back to find Indigo, which scares her. He grabs her and is trying to get her into his car, when Romeo arrives. Romeo goes to fight Kieran, but Indigo tells him not to.

Erin Miller of TV Week called Kieran ""freaky"" and a stalker. She also said that he ""kept hanging around Indi like a bad smell."" Miller later said Kieran was ""a rather intense suitor"" and ""crazed.""

Marty Jones

Marty Jones, played by Matty Lui, made his first appearance on 27 June 2011. Lui won the role of Marty after an audition in Hawaii. Lui told Yahoo!7, ""My agent called me up and said that they are casting a really cool role on the most famous show in Australia and if I was up to auditioning for it, I jumped at the chance and it was awesome working with a super great cast and crew in Hawaii.""

Tegan Callahan

Tegan Mary  Callahan, played by Saskia Burmeister, made her first on-screen appearance on 4 July 2011. Tegan is a River Girl and Darryl Braxton's (Steve Peacocke) ex-girlfriend. She comes to Summer Bay to try and win him back. The character and casting was announced on 24 April 2011. Burmeister told The Daily Telegraph that she had an extended guest role and the door would be left open for a future return. Burmeister said she would love to come back. The actress revealed she and her husband were finalising a European holiday, just as the offer to appear in Home and Away came through. She also revealed that she bleached her usual brown hair blonde for the role. Burmeister's younger sister, Martika Sullivan, who played Kelly O'Mara also landed a role in the show at the same time. 

Burmeister described Tegan as a bitch and a ""naughty character"", which she said attracted her to the role. Burmeister is often cast as the girl next door and she relished the chance to play Tegan. She said ""I love her. I find myself gasping at what she is doing."" The actress added ""She's really nasty, dark and menacing and likes to cause trouble."" Lizzy Lovette of The Sun-Herald said Tegan is a ""manipulative surfer chick"", who arrives in the Bay to ruffle some feathers. Peacocke revealed that Tegan comes to town to do his mother's bidding. He told TV Week, ""Brax has been butting heads with his mum, Cheryl (Suzi Dougherty), so she decides to contact Tegan to suss out what's going on with [him]."" Peacocke explained that Darryl has a soft spot for Tegan because they share a history, but he does not trust her and she is not the type of person he can confide in. Tegan is shocked to learn that Darryl is in a relationship with Charlie Buckton (Esther Anderson). The Daily Star Sunday reported that Tegan will stop at nothing to split Darryl and Charlie up. Darryl wants nothing to do with Tegan and he orders her to leave town after she threatens Charlie. An insider told the paper: ""She's devastated when he tells her to leave. But there really is nothing worse than a woman scorned."" The Daily Record said Tegan was ""certainly a firebrand.""

Tegan comes to Angelo's to see Darryl Braxton, after talking to his mother, Cheryl. Tegan asks him about his new girlfriend, but Darryl refuses to give her any details, so she cannot report back to his mother. Tegan tells Heath Braxton (Daniel Ewing) that Darryl has changed and when he mentions that Darryl owns Angelo's, Tegan goes to see Colleen Smart (Lyn Collingwood). Colleen tells Tegan all about the River Boys and Darryl's arrival in Summer Bay. Tegan later spots Darryl with Charlie Buckton. She confronts Charlie, telling her that she knows about her relationship with Darryl and that their secret is not safe with her. Darryl later tells Tegan to leave. Tegan returns and reveals to Darryl that she is dating Jake Pirovic (Fletcher Humphrys). She tells him that Jake knows about Heath's plan to launch a raid on his land and tells Darryl to stop Heath before he gets killed. Tegan later turns up with bags of drugs and Heath helps her hide them. Tegan goes to see Darryl and she kisses him. They have sex and Charlie finds them together. Jake stabs Darryl and Tegan helps him with his injury. She later reveals to Charlie that Darryl is Darcy's father. Tegan tells Darryl and he initially asks for a DNA test, but changes his mind. Casey (Lincoln Younes) overhears Tegan and Cheryl talking and learns Tegan is lying to Darryl. Casey tells Darryl, who confronts Tegan and she reveals Heath is Darcy's real father. Tegan decides to go back to Jake. A storm hits the Bay and Heath takes Darcy to the high school. Tegan arrives and tells Heath he had no right taking Darcy and they leave.

Harvey Ryan

Harvey Ryan, played by Marcus Graham, made his first on screen appearance on 10 August 2011. The character and casting was announced on 31 July 2011. Graham was originally supposed to have a small guest role, but he asked the producers if he could stay and was contracted until the end of 2012. Of this, Graham told the Herald Sun, ""I came in for a couple of episodes and it was just a really, really great experience ... I've worked with Georgie (Parker) before in theatre and we started in the business around the same time and get along very well so I thought, why not?""

Harvey Ryan is described as being the ""expert on all things sailing and boating in Summer Bay."" He was brought up in Summer Bay and runs a local fishing charter. Of Harvey, the official Home and Away website explained, ""Harvey is a big fish in a small pond and more than capable of winning a woman over with his smile, his easy charm and his blokey boatie ways."" However, Harvey is capable of making enemies and he gets on the wrong side of many locals, including Romeo Smith (Luke Mitchell), who becomes convinced Harvey trashed his boat to ruin his business. Romeo finds out Harvey has been stealing his clients and copying his ideas, and when his boat is vandalised, Romeo decides to report him to the police. The official website said ""The gloves are off and both men settle in for a war."" Romeo later apologises to Harvey, but Harvey is not interested and he complains to the council about Romeo and Alf Stewart (Ray Meagher) not having a permit for their mooring.

On 4 July 2013, it was revealed Graham had finished filming on Home and Away. Following his on-screen departure, Graham explained that it was agreed all round ""that it was time to finish Harvey"" and he called his exit ""harmonious"". Graham admitted to staying with the show longer than he originally planned, as he was enjoying the work. He added that he would not rule out a return to Home and Away in the future.

When Romeo Smith's boat is trashed, he believes Harvey is behind it. He also learns Harvey has stolen some of his clients and has obviously copied his business ideas. Romeo reports Harvey to the police, but Elijah Johnson (Jay Laga'aia) clears Harvey of the crime when he finds the real culprit. Romeo apologises, but Harvey informs him that he has just complained to the council about Romeo's lack of permit for his mooring. Romeo and his partner, Alf, are forced to move their boat, when the council tell them in legal terms, their mooring did not officially exist. Harvey tells Romeo that he is next in line to take over the mooring. However, when he checks it out, he finds it gone. Harvey later confronts Romeo with a story about Alf and the mooring in the paper. Roo Stewart (Georgie Parker) invites three investors to look at the new resort site. Due to an impending storm, Alf stops Romeo from using the Blaxland, but Harvey agrees to take them all out in his boat in the hope of winning the marina contract. The bad weather causes Harvey's boat to sink and Romeo and Alf are forced to save Roo, Harvey and the investors. Romeo finds Harvey, who is injured and manages to get him to the hospital. Harvey asks Alf if they could go into business together as he has the mooring and Alf has the boat. Alf persuades Romeo to agree to the deal. Harvey and Roo go on a date, but Roo leaves early. Harvey asks her out again and they go out to dinner. Romeo gets fed up of Harvey neglecting his jobs an confronts him. Harvey tells Romeo he will pull his weight, but he later tells Alf that Romeo skipped his chores.

Romeo believes Harvey is trying to get the marina contract behind his back when Harvey reveals he is thinking about getting his own boat. Roo begins avoiding Harvey and he thinks she is still in love with Sid Walker (Robert Mammone). However, Roo denies this and kisses Harvey. Harvey empties a can of petrol on the Blaxland and blames Romeo for it in front of Alf. Harvey later offers to buy the Blaxland from Alf. Roo confronts Harvey about using her to get the Blaxland and she breaks up with him. Harvey and Roo realise that they still have feelings for each other and get back together. Harvey runs for a position on the council against Alf and wins. He shuts down the proposed resort and John Palmer (Shane Withington) starts to suspect him of being corrupt. Roo and Harvey briefly break up again, but reconcile. Harvey's ex-wife Melissa (Allison Cratchley) arrives in the Bay with their daughter, Lottie (Morgan Weaving). Harvey contracts food poisoning and while he is in the hospital, Mel visits him and asks to stay at his house. When Harvey is reunited with Lottie, she gives him a cold reception due to his absence. Harvey then tells Roo about Mel and Lottie and she initially gives him the silent treatment as he did not tell her straight away. A week later Roo tells him that she wants to meet Lottie and they go on a picnic. John comes to Harvey and Roo with questions about a newly proposed Eco Park and warns them that he is going to the council. Harvey is later seen arguing with the mayor.

John tells the press that Harvey rigged the council elections and Harvey resigns from the council. He is also punched by a member of the public and Mel treats him. She admits that she is still struggling to deal with their young son, Ben's death. Harvey admits that he was aware of the Mayor's vote rigging scam and has to go to court. Roo convinces him to let her aunt, Morag (Cornelia Frances), represent him and when he pleads guilty, he is given community service and a fine. Harvey then realises he has to sell his house to pay the fine. Harvey and Lottie move into Summer Bay House with Roo, while Mel goes to a clinic in the city to help her deal with Ben's death. When Harvey returns from visiting her, he reveals that she wants Lottie to join her in the city. He breaks the new to Lottie and she decides that she wants to stay in the Bay. Mel does not take the news well and she and Harvey begin a custody battle. Mel threatens to reveal that Harvey was drunk when Ben fell off their boat and died, so Harvey tells Lottie and Roo himself. Lottie eventually decides that Mel needs her and they leave. Harvey proposes to Roo and she accepts. Roo's ex-boyfriend Tim Graham (Jonny Pasvolsky) arrives in Summer Bay intending to get Roo back. Tim and Roo share a kiss, causing Harvey to fight with Tim. When Harvey thinks that Roo has chosen Tim, he goes to the city to see Lottie and ends up having a one-night stand with Mel. Roo later finds out and the pair fight, but they eventually reconcile. Harvey and Roo begin planning their wedding and Roo invites Winston Markman (John Batchelor) to be Harvey's best man. They later marry and run the caravan park together. When teenage runaways Maddy Osborne (Kassandra Clementi) and Spencer Harrington (Andrew Morley) rent a caravan from Harvey and Roo, they become like parents to the two children and they eventually move into Summer Bay House with them.

When Winston returns to the Bay, Harvey makes plans with his best friend to go on a fishing trip with him away from the area. However, Roo receives news that Harvey and Winston's boat is missing, and, although Winston is found quickly, Harvey vanishes for several months. He returns abruptly without explanation of where he has been, but is obviously scarred by the experience. He finds Summer Bay claustrophobic and realising that things have changed between him and Roo, they decide to get a divorce so Harvey can leave. Spencer takes the news that Harvey is leaving badly but they reconcile before Harvey leaves.

Jake Pirovic

Jake Pirovic, played by Fletcher Humphrys, made his first screen appearance on 22 July 2011 and departed on 23 January 2012. In 2014, Humphrys reprised his role as Jake and returned to the serial. Humphrys' co-star Tai Hara, who plays Andy Barrett, spoke to TV Week about Andy's involvement with Jake: ""He's on a one-way train that's going nowhere but off the tracks. It's relentless in terms of the number of stuff-ups he's making. Andy has lied to so many people. Everyone has turned their back on him. He's at his lowest point and thinks he can't possibly make any more bad decisions. Jake's older and Andy thinks he's a shady person. But Jake also gives Andy a sense of validation. It makes him feel better."" It was revealed that Jake's return storyline would culminate in a murder.

Jake is the leader of a rival surf gang to the River Boys. He dates Tegan Callahan (Saskia Burmeister). Jake is arrested alongside Heath Braxton (Dan Ewing), when Heath attempts to raid the rival gang's drug crop but Pirovic is later released. He demands his drugs back from Heath's brother Darryl (Steve Peacocke) and kidnaps their younger brother Casey (Lincoln Younes) and Ruby Buckton (Rebecca Breeds). Brax returns the drugs to Jake in exchange for Casey and Ruby, but when he realises some are missing, he stabs Brax. Jake is later arrested and sent to jail. While inside prison, Jake's brother Hammer (Benedict Samuel) takes over the lead of his crew but is later shot dead by Charlie Buckton after a failed kidnap attempt. Upon his release, he goes to Charlie Buckton's (Esther Anderson) home and shoots her twice killing her in revenge for killing his brother. Jake waits for Brax at his house and the pair fight before Jake takes off in his car, closely followed by Brax. They fight again on the beach and Jake is caught by the police.

Jake tells Andy about Charlie killing Hammer and blames Brax for his brother's death as well.  After Josh wants nothing to do with Andy following the kidnap ordeal, Jake uses it to his advantage and tries to convince Andy that he can stop Brax before his brother gets killed. Andy initially agrees to help Jake but then realises that Jake is planning to kill Brax. When Andy refuses to help Jake anymore with his plan to try to get Brax's attention, Jake kidnaps Josh as leverage. Andy and Casey meet up with Jake to try and rescue Josh and Casey hits Jake with a stick allowing Andy to run off. Brax and his brother Kyle (Nic Westaway) arrive to assist Casey, but Jake ends up shooting Casey from outside the barn whilst aiming for Brax. Casey then dies of his injuries.

Andy later calls Jake and tells him to leave Brax alone because he is already suffering due to Casey's death, but an unrepentant Jake tells him that he is not finished with Brax. Brax then goes looking for Jake to avenge Casey. Brax and Andy hide out at the murder scene where they believe Jake will return to inspect the sight. After spotting tyre tracks on the dirt road he quickly speeds off with Brax & Andy in pursuit. Brax and Jake attempt to run each other off the road when Jake quickly manages to lose the pair but is then cornered on a dead end road, Brax hurtles the car causing it to crash into Jake's vehicle knocking him off the road and seriously injuring him. Brax proceeds to confront the already injured Pirovic one last time but his car explodes. Jake is hospitalised and is put into a medically induced coma on life support. Senior Sergeant Mike Emerson (Cameron Stewart) reveals that Jake was transferred from prison to a low-security facility, as he was deemed not responsible for his actions when shooting Charlie two years ago, under a psychiatric order and had been held there for the past year and ended up escaping.

Brax tells doctor Nate Cooper (Kyle Pryor) to let Jake die but when he refuses Brax tries one last attempt to kill Pirovic by disconnecting his life support machine, but he is arrested by the police before he can do so. Andy then after hours sneaks into the hospital and disconnects Jake's life support machine, causing him to die as a result.

Tristan Swanwick of The Courier-Mail said Thwaites' character is part of a major storyline, which lasts for the rest of the year.

Stu is a new member of the Bay's River Boys. The Gold Coast Mail called him ""another pot-stirring River Boy who comes in to 'rock The Bay'."" Swanwick said Thwaites was too a ""bit too pretty to be a bad-ass River Boy"", but a few fake tattoos would fix that. Of his character, Thwaites told The Courier-Mail, ""Stu's awesome, he has some fights, he gets the girls, it's awesome fun."" Thwaites also told The Cairns Post that Stu would come in and steal the heart of a ""beautiful young lady."" The River Boys rival's are Hammer's (Benedict Samuel) gang. Hammer targets Stu as he is new and he gets his ""Blood & Sand"" tattoo sliced off his arm. Steve Peacocke (who plays Darryl Braxton) said ""They chose the youngest and freshest face to send out a warning, and that's just fuel for the fire."" The attack on Stu, prompts a brawl between the River Boys and Hammer's gang. In February 2012, it was announced Stu's lifeless body would be found in the caravan park by Alf Stewart (Ray Meagher). Robert Mammone who plays Sid Walker, told a columnist for All About Soap that the investigation into Stu's death is ""very thorough and you never know what they may find"". Mammone added that there would be a high amount of questioning and ""several bay residents will becomes suspects"".

Stu becomes a member of The River Boys and is excited to show off his new tattoo at school.

3246,['knows Who ?'],"Dracula is a drama-horror television serial developed by Mark Gatiss and Steven Moffat, based on the 1897 novel of the same name by Bram Stoker. The series, consisting of three episodes, premiered on 1 January 2020 and was broadcast over three consecutive days on BBC One before releasing on Netflix. Claes Bang stars as the title character.

Premise
The series follows Dracula from his origins in Eastern Europe to his battles with Van Helsing's descendants and beyond. Netflix's description reads: ""The Count Dracula legend transforms with new tales that flesh out the vampire's gory crimes—and bring his vulnerability into the light.""

Cast

Episodes

Production

Development
Development on Dracula began in June 2017, with Mark Gatiss and Steven Moffat reuniting to write the episodes. In October 2018, the series was officially commissioned by the BBC, to air on BBC One and Netflix. Claes Bang was set to star as the eponymous Dracula in November 2018. According to the writers, Dracula in their version is ""the hero of his own story"" – the central focus of the narrative and main character, rather than a shadowy villain for more traditional heroes to overcome. As with their TV series Sherlock, they aimed to make their version of Dracula both faithful and faithless at the same time, taking details from the original novel, adding ""a lot of new stuff"" [that was not in the novel] and ignoring some passages from it.

While the series includes a scene in which it is implied that Dracula and Harker have sex, Moffat has said that it is not correct to describe their interpretation of Dracula as bisexual: ""He's bi-homicidal, it's not the same thing. He's killing them, not dating them."" He also added: ""He's not actually having sex with anyone. He's drinking their blood.""

Casting
In February 2019, John Heffernan, Dolly Wells, Joanna Scanlan, Morfydd Clark and Lujza Richter joined the cast, with Gatiss also set to appear in the series. In April, Jonathan Aris, Sacha Dhawan, Nathan Stewart-Jarrett, Catherine Schell, Youssef Kerkour and Clive Russell joined the cast with Jonny Campbell, Damon Thomas and Paul McGuigan announced as directors.

Filming
Moffat revealed filming on the series had begun on 4 March 2019. Filming took place at Orava Castle, Banská Štiavnica and Zuberec in Slovakia and at Bray Studios in Berkshire. Filming was completed on 1 August 2019.

Release

Broadcast
Dracula premiered on BBC One on 1 January 2020, and was broadcast over three consecutive days. The three episodes were released on Netflix on 4 January 2020. The documentary In Search of Dracula, with Mark Gatiss exploring the legacy of the famous Count, aired alongside the series on BBC Two on 3 January. The overnight ratings for the three episodes were 3.60 million, 2.85 million, and 2.70 million respectively.

Marketing
To mark the series premiere, BBC Creative and Talon Outdoor constructed billboards stabbed with wooden stakes that would cast a shadow of the Count after sunset, and below the billboards was a stake inside a case with the label ""In case of vampires - break glass"". These billboards were put up on Brixton Road in London and Upper Dean Street in Birmingham. The billboards won a number of awards and £100,000 worth of media space for the creators at the 2020 Outdoor Media Awards organised by Clear Channel UK in partnership with Campaign.

Reception

Critical reception

The series was met with positive reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes, the series garnered a 71% approval and an average rating of 7.2/10 from 55 critic reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, ""A delicious blend of horror and humor that more-or-less balances modern sensibilities and the character's beloved legacy, Dracula is a frighteningly fun — if not always faithful — time."" Metacritic assigned the series a score of 75 out of 100, based on 8 reviews, signifying ""generally favorable reviews"".

Accolades

Future
In February 2020, Bang expressed his interest in a second series. Gatiss said ""Apparently if you pour blood onto Dracula's ashes he comes back. Who knows? Dracula tends to come back, that's what vampires do – but we have no idea [if the show will return].""

3262,['People Parents Are ’s Clair St. Malcolm ?'],"The Salvation Hunters is a 1925 American silent drama film which marked the directorial debut of the 31-year old Josef von Sternberg. The feature stars Georgia Hale and George K. Arthur, and would bring Sternberg, ""a new talent"", to the attention of the major movie studios, including Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Paramount Pictures. Film Mercury included The Salvation Hunters in its ten-best list for the films of 1925.

Plot
The film opens with a foreword:

There are important fragments of life that have been avoided by the motion picture because Thought is concerned and not the Body. A thought can create and destroy nations—and it is all the more powerful because it is born of suffering, lives in silence, and dies when it has done its work. Our aim has been to photograph a thought—A thought that guides humans who crawl close to the earth—whose lives are simple—who begin nowhere and end nowhere.

The story begins along a bleak waterfront in an unidentified harbor. Industrial refuse litters the shore. A giant Sisyphean dredge scoops mud from a channel and into a massive barge.
Four characters, “humans who crawl close to the earth” occupy the brooding landscape:

The Boy, a fainthearted and feckless youth, wanders aimlessly amid the wreckage. He fancies The Girl. 
The Girl, older and hardened by her impoverishment, has “sunk as low as her socks.” Maintaining a sullen dignity in her solitude, she spurns The Boys diffident advances.
The Child is an orphaned youngster. He silently haunts the mud barge where his parents lost their lives.
The Brute is a man of indeterminate age and short-tempered. He acts as watchman aboard the barge.

The Brute makes a pass at The Girl. She cuts him cold with a glare and he retreats. Frustrated, The Brute assaults The Child who has trespassed on the barge. The Boy witnesses the assault, but is frozen by his cowardice. The Girl, with a single word, shames him into action. He gingerly collects The Child, and they flee together with The Brute in pursuit. The Girl, with a look, signals the dredge operator, who unleashes a torrent of mud on the head of The Brute.

The Boy, The Girl and The Child escape from the desolate docks to the slums of an unnamed metropolis.

As the threesome trudge through the back alleys of the city, they are spotted by The Man and his client, The Gentleman. The Man accosts The Boy and confirms what he suspects: they are homeless and penniless. He assures The Boy that jobs are plentiful, and offers to provide a room for the trio while The Boy seeks employment. Unbeknownst to them, the “room” is located in a brothel. The Man's aim is to enlist The Girl as a prostitute. When they are ushered into the seedy flat, The Woman, a sex worker, attempts to provide them with some refreshment. The Man stops her: “Hunger will whisper things in their ears that I might find troublesome to say.”

As the hours pass, The Girl becomes increasingly anxious due to The Child's pleas for food. The Boy returns from his futile search for work demoralized. They are on the verge of despair. The Boy indulges in a vivid fantasy, in which he, The Girl and The Child are transformed into wealthy aristocrats, who arrive at their estate escorted by servants dressed in faux-military livery.

The Gentlemen, with the encouragement of the Man, enters the room expecting to negotiate sex with a prostitute. The Girl coldly considers the proposition. The Boy becomes distraught when he discerns The Girl's ambivalence. The Gentleman, grasping her dilemma, bestows a gift of money on the Girl without comment and quietly takes his leave. The Child snatches the largesse and bolts to the door, returning shortly with provisions for a meal – the crisis past.

The Man, thwarted in his endeavor, devises another plan in collusion with The Woman. They invite the young trio to an outing in the countryside. There, he intends to seduce The Girl and coerce her into the sex trade: “…let romance do a little work.”. The Woman is tasked with distracting The Boy during the seduction.

The party of five arrives in the country in a touring car. They park next to a real estate sign that reads “Here Your Dreams Come True.” Despite The Man's best efforts, The Girl remains unresponsive to his blandishments. Exasperated, he lashes out at The Child. The Boy, shedding his fear, leaps to the defense of the little boy and beats The Man into submission with his fists. The Girl rejoices that The Boy has claimed his manhood.

Triumphantly, the trio – now a family –strides into the sunset, “children of the sun.”

Cast

Background
English actor and producer George K. Arthur approached Sternberg to film a comedy entitled “Just Plain Buggs"". Sternberg had recently served as assistant-director and writer on Roy William Neill’s film By Devine Right (1924) and accepted the offer, with the caveat that they substitute his own screenplay, The Salvation Hunters, to which Arthur agreed.

Though the details remain “confused and controversial” the film was financed by Sternberg and Arthur for just under five-thousand dollars. Sternberg contributed the bulk of his personal savings to meet budgetary shortfalls. In this respect, The Salvation Hunters may be considered an independent film and as such “an almost unique specimen in its time.”

Production
Filming began in the fall of 1924. The movie was shot on location in California, including San Pedro, Chinatown, San Fernando Valley and at Grand-Asher Studios.

Due to budgetary restraints, Sternberg and Arthur employed Hollywood extras, so-called ""supers"", rather than featured players. Georgia Hale was a cabaret singer and dress extra on Vanity's Price (1924) when Sternberg tapped for the role of The Girl. She and most of the cast agreed to ""defer"" salaries. Stuart Holmes, who played The Gentleman, was an exception; a well-known screen ""villain"" - and famous sculptor - he was paid $100 in advance for his brief, but effective, appearance in The Salvation Hunters.

Reception
The Salvation Hunters was a “complete failure” at its New York City premiere, where it ran less than a week. Nationwide, attendance was “unspectacular.” As Sternberg, at the Hollywood premiere remarked, “The members of the cast were in the audience, which greeted my work with laughter and jeers and finally rioted. Many walked out, and so did I.”

In the aftermath of the film's brief showing, Arthur took steps to see that a print was smuggled into the home of actor-director-producer Charlie Chaplin, where it received a private viewing by the film star and associates Douglas Fairbanks, Sr., Mary Pickford and Joseph Schenck. Subsequently, The New York Times Sunday entertainment section of February 1, 1925 carried the following announcement:

At years’ end Film Mercury movie critic Anabel Lane included The Salvation Hunters in the top-10 list for 1925:

1. Cecil B. DeMille’s Isn’t Life Wonderful
2. King Vidor’ The Big Parade
3. Erich von Stroheim’s Greed
4. Sven Gade’s Siège
5. Augusto Genina’s Cyrano de Bergerac
6. Clarence Badger’s Paths to Paradise
7. F. W. Murnau’s The Last Laugh
8. Josef von Sternberg’s The Salvation Hunters
9. Malcolm St. Clair’s Are Parents People?
10.Herbert Brenon’s Peter Pan

With his star rising among the studio executives, Sternberg signed a long-term contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Despite this promising entry into commercial movie-making his ""association [with Metro] was doomed from the start"" as evidenced in his first feature The Exquisite Sinner.

Theme
“The underlying theme of Sternberg’s cinema,” observes critic Andrew Sarris, is the relationships of men and women “or more precisely, man’s confrontation of the myths of womanhood.” His oeuvre demonstrates this “from The Salvation Hunters to Anatahan”, his last film.

The Gentleman (played by Stewart Holmes) is “curious”: the “first screen character who respects the women he seeks to reduce to prostitution.”  The Gentleman is portrayed neither as a depraved denizen of bordellos nor a salacious deviate.  “[T]hough eager to sleep with The Girl, he never loses his dignity or bearing [and] respects her reluctance when he discovers she is driven by hunger”, as well as concern for her younger companions. Sternberg's Gentleman is a “far more advanced” depiction of the “predatory Men of the World” than achieved by directors Chaplin or Lubitsch in the 1920s. The character “prefigures G.W. Pabst’s treatment of Louise Brooks and her respectful lovers in Diary of a Lost Girl and Pandora's Box” in the late twenties.

The Girl, who with merely a look succeeds in deflecting The Brute and commands the operation of heavy equipment (the mud-dredge), exhibits “a mystical authority...[an] authority which marks Sternberg’s attitude toward women long before the debut of Marlene Dietrich. “The real drama of The Salvation Hunters is not concerned with the rise of the downtrodden, but rather with the moving (emotion in motion) spectacle of a Girl waiting for a Boy to grow into a Man.”

It is situated beneath the mountain Poľana.

Etymology
The name means 'youth' in Slovak and was probably motivated by the majority of young people among the first settlers.

History
Detva was created as a village of bondage in a deep-forested area belonging to Zvolenská Slatina and Očová upon instruction of the owner of the Vígľaš dominion Ladislav Čáky resp. Ladislaus Csáky in 1636-1638. The first settlers were coal producers from Ľubietová, followed by Walachian-type settlers from northern and eastern parts of Slovakia and immigrants from other surrounding villages. In 1787, Ján Vagač founded the first known manufactory producing bryndza cheese. The settlement became an oppidum (market town) in 1811 and a town in 1965. In 1996 the town of Detva became the seat of new Detva district.

It was developed as a large newly cleared land and this character has been preserved up to present, despite the fact that a part of the newly cleared lands were separated from Detva - Hriňová (before 1863), Detvianska Huta (in ?), Korytárky (in 1955; part of Kriváň until 1993) and Kriváň (in 1955). Logging and wood processing, sheep breeding and peasantry had been the main source of bread and butter of the Detvans. Hard living conditions at distant isolated newly cleared lands and self-sufficiency in providing of basic living needs determined the formation of the original material and spiritual culture of local inhabitants and thanks to this Detva had become one of the symbols of the modern Slovak nation.

In 1955 Detva experienced a significant change. A factory for military machinery and strategic constructions was built in the town's woods for security purposes. This factory, called Podpolianske strojárne Detva (PPS) at that time, produced UNC machinery, aka ""Universal"" on Western European markets. Machinery such as front loaders and skid steer loaders used to reach an annual production of 4,000. The factory enlarged the population of Detva from 3,500 to over 12,000, employing over 70% of Detva's population. However, after the Velvet Revolution and the split of Czechoslovakia, infamous illegal and non-transparent privatization, typical of then Central and Eastern European states, took place. Detva's PPS factory had to put its production on halt and to downsize its workforce from 8,000 in 1993 to 1,000 in 2005.

Demographics
According to the 2001 census, the town had 15,122 inhabitants. 96.11% of inhabitants were Slovaks, 1.75% Roma, and 0.75% Czechs. The religious make-up was 78.03% Roman Catholics, 13.11% people with no religious affiliation and 4.47% Lutherans.

3343,"['country the entered they since themselves proving been have they when over and over themselves prove to have Americans - African should why , asks Washington T. Booker ?']","The Future of the American Negro, a book written in 1899 by American educator Booker T. Washington, set forth his ideas regarding the history of enslaved and freed African-American people and their need for education to advance themselves. It was re-published as a second edition in 1900 and was made available in electronic form in 2008 via Project Gutenberg.

Background 

In the beginning of the book, the author mentions the term ""industrial education"". Washington describes this term as meaning, learning the necessities to become a valuable member of society as well and being able to apply this knowledge to industrial business. He believes that even though slavery is illegal, the freed African-Americans are still enslaved to the white people. Those who are freed cannot be members of society because they are not given the same opportunities.

As the book continues, Booker T. Washington writes that in order to understand the stress he applies to industrial education, the reader must ""review the condition of affairs at the present time in the Southern States."" He provides the information that the North and South are linked even though they were once at war. If the North cannot provide education then the South will not provide it.

Washington also states that the African-Americans are not superior, but that they are definitely not inferior to the white people. Slaves have had a hard time throughout their life in the United States. Their strength, knowledge, and perseverance has been tested by the white people that have run their lives for the longest time. Booker T. Washington asks, why should African-Americans have to prove themselves over and over when they have been proving themselves since they entered the country? The author also reminds them that, ""An individual cannot succeed unless that individual has a great amount of faith himself.""

African-Americans can have all the faith they want, but Washington argues that knowledge is needed to become useful members of society. Blacks have worked hard but will have to understand what they are working for.

Throughout the book, Washington refers to Tuskegee, a university founded by himself and others. It was a historically black university in Tuskegee, Alabama. In The Future of an American Negro, Booker writes that the university is, ""placing men and women of intelligence, religion, modesty, conscience, and skill in every community in the South."" Washington believes that Tuskegee University is providing the South with valuable members of society. In ""Chapter V"", there is a reference to a study showing that some 3,000 graduates or students are doing ""commendable"" work in the Southern community.

Near the end of the book, Washington describes the difference for freed slaves in the North and South. He reminds the reader that North has fewer employment option for black people which perpetuates the stress on the morals of an African-American. The South, however, having more opportunities for work and less stress on trying to do the right thing. He goes on to end the book with five principles that will aid African-Americans in their fight to have truly equal rights and opportunities. He states that these principle will be essential by saying, ""So long as the Negro is permitted to get education, acquire property, and secure employment, and is treated with respect in the business or commercials world, … I shall have the greatest faith in his working out his own destiny in the Southern States.""

It is historically significant for its role in exhibiting the works of the American Abstract expressionists Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning, Lee Krasner, John Ferren, and Robert Motherwell; performances by Helen Hayes, Thornton Wilder, Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., Bob Fosse and Gwen Verdon, Eli Wallach and Anne Jackson, and hundreds of other world-class stars of stage and screen; and involvement by the literary figures George Plimpton, Peter Matthiessen, Gore Vidal, Edward Albee, and John Steinbeck. It holds a permanent collection of 2,400 works of art and continues to build on important relationships in the worlds of film, theatre, dance, music, and visual art. The museum's current director is Andrea Grover, who was previously Curator of Special Projects of the Parrish Art Museum.

History 
Conceived of and mainly funded by the philanthropist Mrs. Lorenzo E. Woodhouse, Guild Hall opened to great fanfare on August 19, 1931 (""East Hampton has never known a celebration like that""), when 1,000 people crammed into the theater and gallery. The building site, on Main Street, was the former homestead of Samuel Miller, a farmer, between the First Presbyterian Church of East Hampton and Mulford Farm, a homestead which dates back to pre-Revolutionary War times.

As stated in the legal documents granting permission for the forming of Guild Hall, its mission has been, from the outset, to ""encourage and cultivate a taste for music, drama, and the arts through the presentation of musical, dramatic and other intellectual and instructive opinions; to furnish galleries for art entertainments; for the exchange of and objects of  historical interest; to furnish a meeting place for various organizations; in short to promote and encourage a higher type of citizenship"".

Guild Hall's early trustees were predominantly members of the conservative social elite with token representation from the year-round community. Eventually, the ""rebels in their own social set"" persuaded the reluctant board to agree to a regional invitational visual arts show that would bring some of the most prominent artists of the day—as well as an embracing of more broad and avant garde criteria—to Guild Hall.

Visual arts 

In 1973, Guild Hall Museum was among the earliest institutions in the United States to receive formal accreditation from the American Alliance of Museums. Of the 35,000 museums nationwide, Guild Hall is still one of approximately 1,000 to hold this distinction.  The museum mounts eight to ten exhibitions per year, including an East End–wide student art exhibition.  One of two galleries at Guild Hall is named for its founder, Mrs. Lorenzo E. Woodhouse; another for the painter Thomas Moran, who is credited with ""colonizing"" the Village of East Hampton as an artists' community in the mid-19th century. The third, smallest, gallery is named for the East Hampton artist and collector Tito Spiga, whose bequest funded the building of the gallery upon his death in 1988.

There have been many notable artists of historical interest who have been exhibited at Guild Hall, such as Roy Lichtenstein, Lee Krasner, Jackson Pollock, Childe Hassam, Franz Kline, Robert Dash, Fairfield Porter, Thomas Moran, and Robert Motherwell.  In recent years, art by area artists who are also internationally celebrated has included that of Larry Rivers, Ross Bleckner, Eric Fischl, April Gornik, Miriam Schapiro, Esteban Vicente, Barbara Kruger, Audrey Flack, Elaine de Kooning, Andy Warhol, Dan Flavin, Elliott Erwitt, Hans Namuth, Julian Schnabel, and Jane Wilson.

Notable exhibitions 
17 Artists of Eastern Long Island:  In 1949, the Board reluctantly agreed to the first Guild Hall regional invitational show, which installed works by Jackson Pollock, Lee Krasner, Balcomb Greene and Nat Werner, among others.  Attendance of the preview was one of the largest on record. The show coincided with an August 8, 1949, four-page spread in Life magazine, ""Jackson Pollock: Is He the Greatest Living Painter in the United States?"", which introduced Pollock to the world and solidified his role as an international sensation. Pollock and his wife, the artist Lee Krasner, had been living and working at their famed studio in Springs, outside the Village, since 1945, which is now the Pollock-Krasner House.

New Additions to the Guild Hall Permanent Collection: In 2014, the museum held a major exhibition of works of area artists that had recently been added to its permanent collection. The exhibit reflected ""the abundance and diversity of artistic practice on the East End of Long Island"" and was ""a thought-provoking exhibition that beckons revisiting ..."". Works by Jennifer Bartlett, Chuck Close, Carolyn Conrad, Robert Dash, Eric Fischl, Cornelia Foss, Ralph Gibson, April Gornik, Mary Heilmann, William King, Barbara Kruger, Thomas Moran, Costantino Nivola, Alfonso Ossorio, Betty Parsons, Clifford Ross, David Salle, and Carol Saxe were included.

Robert Motherwell: The East Hampton Years, 1944–1952: Curated by Phyllis Tuchman and accompanied by a book with the same title, the 2014 show of approximately 25 works brought together Motherwell’s fusion of gestural abstraction and Color Field painting, while also including some of his collages and published examples of his work as an editor.

Annual Artist Members Exhibition: First mounted in 1938, the sole criterion is membership in Guild Hall.  The exhibit has been noted for its non-jury policy which, in an area historically known for the visual arts and its close proximity to New York City, creates a mix of ""prestigious area professionals showing next to those less well known and hoping to be discovered"".

Theater arts 

The John Drew Theater at Guild Hall produces more than 100 programs each year, including plays, concerts, dance performances, film screenings, simulcasts, and literary readings.  It was posthumously named for the matinee idol John Drew Jr., a member of the Barrymore family who summered in East Hampton from the late 19th century to the early 20th century.  The theater has an octagonal shape, a jewel-box proscenium stage, and a blue and white striped trompe-l'œil circus-tent ceiling that sweeps up to a chandelier of glass balloons.

In its early years, the theater served as a summer testing ground for productions en route to Broadway. Legendary playwrights such as Tennessee Williams and Eugene O’Neill credited Guild Hall with helping to establish their reputations, and Edward Albee had a lifelong relationship with the John Drew Theater, where he was an active member of the Guild Hall Academy of the Arts. Performers have included the Academy, Emmy, Grammy, and Tony Award–winning luminaries Alec Baldwin, Matthew Broderick, Blythe Danner, James Earl Jones, Patti LuPone, Wynton Marsalis, Liza Minnelli, Leslie Odom Jr., Audra McDonald, Laurie Metcalf, Mercedes Ruehl, Steve Martin, and Marlo Thomas; the dance companies Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, New York City Ballet, and Pilobolus; the performance artists Laurie Anderson and Meredith Monk; the directors Robert Wilson, Susan Stroman, Tony Walton, Harris Yulin, Bob Fosse, Gwen Verdon, and Julie Taymor; the jazz greats Winton Marsalis, Branford Marsalis, Sonny Rollins, Earl Klugh and Regina Carter; the comedians Jay Leno, Joy Behar, John Leguizamo, Jerry Seinfeld, and Martin Short; and the legendary musicians Mavis Staples, Patti Smith, Philip Glass, Billy Joel, and The Beach Boys.

The theater underwent a detailed renovation in 2007, supervised by the architect Robert A. M. Stern, restoring the original 1931 details while installing new AV and mechanical systems, digitized lighting controls, motorized rigging and moving lights, and upgraded technical booth. The tradition of providing a testing ground for artists to make work continues today with the John Drew Theater Lab. and a strong emphasis on developmental readings. The John Drew Theater's current artistic director, Josh Gladstone, has programmed and produced the performing arts programming at Guild Hall since 2000.

Notable productions 
The longest-running off-Broadway musical, The Fantasticks, was produced at Guild Hall’s John Drew Theater before starting its historic New York run. Nora Ephron and Delia Ephron debuted Love, Loss, and What I Wore at Guild Hall before taking the play Off Broadway. Tennessee Williams's The Glass Menagerie, starring Amy Irving and Ebon Moss-Bachrach, was the inaugural play after the two-year John Drew Theater renovation. Alec Baldwin and Laurie Metcalf starred in a revival of Arthur Miller's All My Sons in 2015.

Hamptons Film Festival  
Since the inception of the Hamptons International Film Festival (HIFF), Guild Hall has played a role in the festival. The theater screens films during the festival, as well as offering special programming and screening during the year in partnership with HIFF. Academy Award–winning films that have premiered at the festival and screened at Guild Hall have included Gods and Monsters, Black Swan, Pollock, and Moonlight.

Education and community

Academy of the Arts 
Past recipients of the Academy of the Arts award have included the actor Lauren Bacall, the artist Paul Davis, and the author John Irving. The artist Eric Fischl is the current Academy of the Arts president.  The academy has expanded its charter to support and mentor emerging artists with the mission of sustaining the legacy of the Hamptons as an arts colony with the Artist in Residence (AIR) program.

Hamptons Institute  
The Hamptons Institute, originally formed in 2010 by board chairman Melville ""Mickey"" Straus, was revived by actor Alec Baldwin and institute director Tracy Marshall in 2016 to present a range of intellectual and professional perspectives on challenging issues and to engage in thoughtful debate and deliberation on subjects ranging from economics and business to politics and public policy, and from arts and culture to the role of the media.  Panel discussions in recent years have featured panelists Amy Goodman, Nicholas Lemann, Bob Garfield, Jonathan Alter, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, Dr. Paul Farmer, Elizabeth Warren, Van Jones, Ken Auletta, Katie Couric, John Podhoretz, and Monica Crowley.

According to Baldwin,
{{quote|What Tracy Marshall and I did was revive, at the request of Andrea Grover, executive director at Guild Hall, the old Hamptons Institute that Mickey Straus had put together. ... We did it with a little bit of trepidation, because I thought it's [something] where you live or die by who you cast. Who are you going to get to do this? Are they well known or are they really just these dazzling authorities? Who’s going to show up, and therefore what kind of a program are we going to have? How are we going to be received? ... The final one [this year], ""The New Normal in News: Ideology vs. Fact,"" which I am moderating, is all about the discussion of fake news versus mainstream media.

Education programs 
Guild Hall's founding principle in 1931 was to be a gathering place where an appreciation for the arts would serve ""to promote a finer type of citizenship"", with educational programs championing a vigorous, growing network of intergenerational artists who would, in turn, extend the legacy of the region as one of the country’s most storied arts colonies.  Guild Hall offers a variety of educational programs in the visual and performing arts for children aged 5–18.  The Guild Hall Teen Arts Council (GHTAC) is a newly launched program that offers ten teenagers per year the opportunity to work for Guild Hall as content producers, curators, and programmers. Modeled after the Walker Art Center's pioneering program, the GHTAC meets bimonthly with a GH coordinator to generate programming for their peers. GHTAC members are chosen each semester by an application process and are paid for their work.

3557,"['blue and red colors the mentions poem What "" , "" Question Million 64 $ "" the him asking and booth isolation an into Foghorn pushing , host show quiz a be to pretends then fox The ?']","Fox-Terror is a 1957 Warner Bros. Merrie Melodies animated short directed by Robert McKimson. The cartoon was released on May 11, 1957, and features Foghorn Leghorn and the Barnyard Dawg. The title is a play on the dog breed name ""Fox Terrier.""

By the time of this cartoon's release, the Stephen Foster song ""Camptown Races"" has been established as Foghorn Leghorn's theme; in other cartoons Foghorn normally hums the verse, but in this cartoon he sings specially-written lyrics about fishing.

The cartoon also briefly paid homage to the then-wildly popular genre of television quiz shows, particularly The $64,000 Question which, like many other quiz shows of the day, would soon become embroiled in scandal and be taken off the air a year later.

Plot
A fox scampers away from the henhouse when a young rooster rings the alarm bell. Barnyard Dawg arrives, but sees no fox, so he thinks the rooster just rang the bell because he wanted a drink of water. When he sees Foghorn Leghorn leave to go fishing, the fox disguises himself and suggests that he go hunting instead and bring the dog with him. Foggy likes this idea, so he grabs a shotgun and ties a rope around Dawg's neck and drags him away. The fox heads for the henhouse, but the young rooster rings the alarm again. Dawg runs back, dragging Foghorn behind him, but again the fox scampers away. Dawg only sees the rooster ringing the bell and assumes he's just thirsty again.

The fox then pretends to be a quiz show host, pushing Foghorn into an isolation booth and asking him the ""$64 Million Question"", ""What poem mentions the colors red and blue?""; the fox instructs Foghorn to push a buzzer in the booth when he comes to 'red' and press it again when he comes to 'blue'.  Foghorn guesses ""Roses are red.."", pushing the buzzer once, detonating one of two firecrackers in Dawg's mouth (causing him to lose three of his teeth), but Dawg, walking off-camera, grabs the buzzer and guesses the other half of the question, ""..and violets are blue!"", pressing the buzzer the second time, setting off the other firecracker that he stuffed in Foghorn's mouth.  Meanwhile, the fox returns to the henhouse. The young rooster again pulls the alarm, and the fox flees before Dawg arrives. Again, seeing no fox, Dawg dumps a whole bucket of water on the little rooster.

The fox unpacks a ""Magic Folding Box"" and lures Dawg into it with a bone. When the dog is inside, the fox folds the box into a tiny package, then disguises himself as a swami and sells it as a ""lucky charm"" to Foghorn, who is on his way to go fishing again. Foghorn throws it over his shoulder for luck and it lands in the well. Dawg emerges battered and bruised and he folds Foghorn into a tiny package and throws him into the well. The young rooster pulls the alarm again. Having had enough, an enraged Dawg tries to hit him with a mallet. However, the young rooster beat him to it, as he hits Dawg in the head as payback for dumping water on him earlier. Luckily, Dawg and Foghorn realize the fox has been tricking them both with disguises and ruses, and the two decide to join forces and give the fox a taste of his own medicine.

3617,['right be she Will ?'],"Herman Kahn (February 15, 1922 – July 7, 1983) was a founder of the Hudson Institute and one of the preeminent futurists of the latter part of the twentieth century. He originally came to prominence as a military strategist and systems theorist while employed at the RAND Corporation. He became known for analyzing the likely consequences of nuclear war and recommending ways to improve survivability, making him one of the historical inspirations for the title character of Stanley Kubrick's classic black comedy film satire Dr. Strangelove. In his commentary for Fail Safe, director Sidney Lumet remarked that the Professor Groeteschele character is also based on Herman Kahn.
Kahn's theories contributed heavily to the development of the nuclear strategy of the United States.

Background 

Kahn was born in Bayonne, New Jersey, the son of Yetta (née Koslowsky) and Abraham Kahn, a tailor. His parents were Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe. He was raised in the Bronx, then in Los Angeles following his parents' divorce. Raised Jewish, he later became an atheist.

Cold War theories 

Kahn's major contributions were the several strategies he developed during the Cold War to contemplate ""the unthinkable""namely, nuclear warfareby using applications of game theory. Kahn is often cited (with Pierre Wack) as a father of scenario planning.

Kahn argued for deterrence and believed that if the Soviet Union believed that the United States had a second strike capability then it would offer greater deterrence, which he wrote in his paper titled ""The Nature and Feasibility of War and Deterrence"".

The bases of his work were systems theory and game theory as applied to economics and military strategy. Kahn argued that for deterrence to succeed, the Soviet Union had to be convinced that the United States had second-strike capability in order to leave the Politburo in no doubt that even a perfectly coordinated massive attack would guarantee a measure of retaliation that would leave them devastated as well:

In 1962, Kahn published a 16-step escalation ladder.  By 1965 he had developed this into a 44-step ladder.

Hudson Institute 

In 1961, Kahn, Max Singer and Oscar Ruebhausen founded the Hudson Institute, a think tank initially located in Croton-on-Hudson, New York, where Kahn was living at the time. He recruited sociologist Daniel Bell, political philosopher Raymond Aron and novelist Ralph Ellison (author of the 1952 classic Invisible Man).

The Year 2000 

In 1967, Herman Kahn and Anthony J. Wiener published The Year 2000: A Framework for Speculation on the Next Thirty-Three Years, which included contributions from staff members of the Hudson Institute and an introduction by Daniel Bell. Table XVIII in the document contains a list called ""One Hundred Technical Innovations Very Likely in the Last Third of the Twentieth Century"". The first ten predictions were:
 Multiple applications of lasers.
 Extreme high-strength structural materials.
 New or improved superperformance fabrics.
 New or improved materials for equipment and appliances.
 New airborne vehicles (Ground-effect vehicles, giant or supersonic jets, VTOL, STOL).
 Extensive commercial applications of shaped-charge explosives.
 More reliable and longer-range weather forecasting.
 Extensive and/or intensive expansion of tropical agriculture and forestry.
 New sources of power for fixed installations.
 New sources of power for ground transportation.

Later years 

In Kahn's view, capitalism and technology held nearly boundless potential for progress, while the colonization of space lay in the near, not the distant, future. Kahn's 1976 book The Next 200 Years, written with William Brown and Leon Martel, presented an optimistic scenario of economic conditions in the year 2176. He also wrote a number of books extrapolating the future of the American, Japanese and Australian economies and several works on systems theory, including the well-received 1957 monograph Techniques of System Analysis.

During the mid-1970s, when South Korea's GDP per capita was one of the lowest in the world, Kahn predicted that the country would become one of the top 10 most powerful countries in the world by the year 2000.

In his last year, 1983, Kahn wrote approvingly of Ronald Reagan's political agenda in The Coming Boom: Economic, Political, and Social and bluntly derided Jonathan Schell's claims about the long-term effects of nuclear war. On July 7 that year, he died of a stroke, aged 61.

Personal life
Herman Kahn was the son of Abraham Kahn and Yetta Kahn. His wife was Rosalie ""Jane"" Kahn.  He and Jane had two children, David and Debbie.

Cultural influence 

Along with John von Neumann, Edward Teller and Wernher von Braun, Kahn was, reportedly, an inspiration for the character ""Dr. Strangelove"" in the eponymous film by Stanley Kubrick released in 1964. After Kubrick read Kahn's book On Thermonuclear War, he began a correspondence with him which led to face-to-face discussions between Kubrick and Kahn. In the film, Dr. Strangelove refers to a report on the Doomsday Machine by the ""BLAND Corporation"". Kahn gave Kubrick the idea for the ""Doomsday Machine"", a device which would immediately cause the destruction of the entire planet in the event of a nuclear attack. Both the name and the concept of the weapon are drawn from the text of On Thermonuclear War. Louis Menand observes, ""In Kahn’s book, the Doomsday Machine is an example of the sort of deterrent that appeals to the military mind but that is dangerously destabilizing. Since nations are not suicidal, its only use is to threaten.""

3694,"[""we n't Have ?""]","Mujeres Encinta was a short-lived musical project / concept band known for recording only on cassette. They sang in English, Spanish and French and wrote most of their songs in collaboration. The wide range of background and musical styles of its members was both conducive for their originality and richness as a project, as well as one of the main reasons for their break-up. Despite the fact that they released cassettes with known labels, they remain an obscure band known mainly to artsy crowds.

Lineup

Mujeres Encinta was also known for their many fluctuating international members. The line-up often changed according to the city where the band was playing or recording and the availability of its members. Most of them were already part of other bands.

The following musicians were, at some point between 1999 and 2002, members of Mujeres Encinta: M. C. Schmidt from Matmos, Ros Murray bassist with Electrelane, Genís Segarra from Spanish indie pop bands Astrud and Hidrogenesse, visual artist Daniela Franco, Camilo Lara from Instituto Mexicano del Sonido,  Eduardo Leal de la Gala bassist with Wreckless Eric and Les Tétines Noires,  Beto Cabrera,  former drummer of the Mexican band Zoé, Oulipian member and reviews editor for The Believer, Daniel Levin Becker, and French cellist Vincent Ségal. As well as several members of bands from the Spanish Indie Pop scene such as Espanto and Las Pulpas.

Discography
Mujeres Encinta released a number of cassettes and singles, some self-released, others across a variety of labels. They were a prolific band and, given the fact that all of their recordings were analog and on limited edition, their tapes are hard to find and keep track of.

3776,"['now you are Where "" , Angel of ask - "" beginning the at there "" was who , Cordelia through - to opportunity ideal an presents episode this explains Whedon ?', 'other each against David and me turn you do How ?']","""You're Welcome"" is the twelfth episode of season five of the television show Angel. Written and directed by David Fury, it is the 100th episode of the series, and originally broadcast on February 4, 2004 on the WB network. In ""You're Welcome,"" former series regular Charisma Carpenter returns as a guest star, when the character of Cordelia Chase miraculously awakens from her coma. It is her duty to put Angel, who has recently been feeling ineffective at fighting the powers of darkness, back on the right path. Meanwhile, Angel's old enemy Lindsey McDonald has resurfaced and is plotting revenge. This episode features the death and final onscreen appearance of Cordelia.

The episode was written to reinforce the show's earlier themes, and examine the evolution of the characters in the show's one hundred episodes. The original plan was for Sarah Michelle Gellar to return as Buffy Summers, but when she could not appear due to the death of her aunt and work obligations, it instead focused on rounding off the character of Cordelia. The episode proved generally popular with critics, who praised Charisma Carpenter's final performance as Cordelia and the sense of resolution for the character.

Plot
Cordelia emerges from her coma after experiencing a vision of the symbols painted on Eve's apartment door and tattooed on Lindsey's chest. After Angel and Wesley collect Cordelia from the hospital, she reveals that the vision which woke her from the coma showed Angel in peril. She finds the symbols from her vision in a book, and Wesley recognizes them as runes to protect and conceal, effective against surveillance. Cordelia apologizes to Wesley for killing Lilah while under Jasmine's control. 

Spike complains to Lindsey (who is impersonating Doyle) that the deranged slayer chopped off his hands. Lindsey reveals he also had one of his hands severed. Spike bites Cordelia until Angel fights him off. Spike explains he was tasting whether she was evil, as his source claimed. Angel questions the source, and Spike says it was Doyle. Angel confronts Eve, suggesting she is working with the Doyle impersonator manipulating Spike. Eve confesses that Lindsey is activating a fail-safe left by the Senior Partners to destroy Angel. When Spike mentions ""Doyle"" had a hand chopped off, Angel deduces that ""Doyle"" is Lindsey. Angel battles Lindsey, who is strengthened by his runes. While Angel and Lindsey fight, Cordelia disables the fail-safe. Wesley and Fred perform a spell that causes Lindsey's tattoos to disappear, making him visible to the Senior Partners. Lindsey is sucked into a portal.

Angel and Cordelia say their goodbyes and share a kiss. Angel receives a phone call informing him that Cordelia has died. He realizes, with teary eyes, that Cordelia never awoke from her coma.

Production
The fight scene between Lindsey and Angel in the underground chamber, which took three days to film, was written by Steven S. DeKnight. Christian Kane, who went through two-and-a-half months of sword training for his role in Secondhand Lions, approached the writers to see if they could work his new skills into the episode; Kane ended up performing his own stunts for the sword fight sequence, including wire work.
He also did his own stunts for the scene when Lindsey moves through the  lasers in the tunnel, which were not CGI, but actual lasers.  During the fight scene between Eve and Harmony, Sarah Thompson says Mercedes McNab slapped her accidentally. ""She was... so worried she'd hurt me but it actually worked well for the take because I reacted by really screaming,"" Thompson says.

David Boreanaz had just had knee surgery prior to filming, so writer David Fury did his best to keep Angel sitting down as much as possible. Fury used tight camera angles during Spike's apartment scene with Lindsey  to disguise the fact that the same set was used earlier for the opening teaser. ""Everything is a bit contained; the reason is if I turn around, this is where they found the dead nuns,"" Fury explains.

Writing
Joss Whedon says he used the 100th episode to reinforce the ""mission statement"" of the show, as well as assess where the characters are now compared to how they began. Whedon explains this episode presents an ideal opportunity to - through Cordelia, who was ""there at the beginning"" - ask of Angel, ""Where are you now? Where were you when you started and where are you now and how do you feel about that?""  The return to the show's ""original concerns"" is echoed by the flashback to Doyle's first season advertisement; Sara Upstone points out aerial images of Los Angeles reappear at the same time Cordelia tells Angel ""You forgot who you are,"" bringing back the show's link to the city. This episode, written as a stand-alone as per the network's request, also sets up a critical plot-thread for the season arc that ""will begin to reveal itself toward the end of the season,"" Whedon says.
The character of Buffy Summers was originally intended to appear in the 100th episode, focusing on the rivalry between Angel and Spike and their feelings for Buffy, but Sarah Michelle Gellar was unavailable. Writer/director David Fury explains that since ""we couldn't get Sarah,"" the episode was instead written for Cordelia Chase. He adds, ""This turned out to be a Godsend because Charisma was fantastic."" In the original script, Fury wrote a conversation between Wesley and Angel while driving to the hospital that set up Cordelia as a possible vegetable. The scene was never shot because ""the shock of seeing her up and around after a 9-month coma was enough. We just didn't want to tip it too soon,"" says Fury.

Christian Kane was genuinely upset when an addition by Joss Whedon in the script called for Angel to refer to Lindsey as a ""tiny Texan.""  Although born in Texas, Kane identifies as a ""Sooner"" and ""I'm stronger than David, bigger than David, I'm just shorter.""  Kane says Joss ""likes to take shots at me. He's like, 'I can't build this character up too much without cutting his nuts just a little bit.'""

Cast
Carpenter says she was satisfied with the way her character left the show, as she feels Cordelia's story has been fully resolved. Creator Joss Whedon agreed, saying, ""In seven years, we'd sort of run through our course of [the] character and didn't want to start just doing hollow riffs on what we'd done."" Since Whedon suspected this season would be the last, Carpenter says, ""we didn't want to just leave Cordelia in a coma..this would be a very big story left untold."" Carpenter says the 100th episode was a momentous time to have her character die, calling it ""bittersweet...a love letter to Cordelia"" and the story ""one of the sweetest they'd ever told.""  David Fury agrees: ""It's a beautiful farewell to Charisma for the series"" and it  gives ""Charisma a send off that was respectful to her and Cordelia Chase. I was very proud to have my name on it.""

Actor Christian Kane says he had a difficult time calling himself 'Doyle' because he felt on some level he was masquerading as deceased Glenn Quinn. ""It was a very awkward situation for me and David because we were close to Glenn,"" says Kane. ""I didn't know how the fans were going to react to it.""  Kane says the memory of Quinn upset Boreanaz: ""I could see it in his eyes... it’s got to be a tough deal for him."" However, Kane thinks that ""Joss is brilliant because he used that. How do you turn me and David against each other? You really can’t because we’re such close friends. So to use that for Angel and Lindsey, I think has a little bit of brilliance to it. It’s kind of sick...but it did the job.""  David Fury adds, ""I think [the fans] appreciated it from the standpoint that we were honoring him. That Doyle's not a forgotten piece of this world.""

Reception
This episode was rated as one of the series' top five episodes in a poll done by Angel Magazine. TV Guide praised Charisma Carpenter's ""blithe comic delivery""; the BBC noted that Carpenter's return elevated the script from ""merely great to something close to awesome,"" but griped because the show's tight budget left Lindsey's activation of the fail-safe an ""unfulfilled promise.""

Reaction to the death of long-time character Cordelia was generally positive. After being disgusted by Cordelia's fourth season arc, which she claims ""destroyed Cordy's character and viewer trust"", author Jennifer Crusie applauds this episode.  ""The writers play fair,"" she says, ""foreshadowing the Gotcha to come"" - Cordelia is in a private room, yet hastily draws the curtains around a bed-ridden roommate, and remarks to Angel that she understands why Doyle used his ""last breath to make sure [Angel] kept fighting."" Rather than undercutting the emotional impact of the story, the twist of Cordelia's tragic ending reinforces and honors her character. ""She is...our Cordy again,"" Crusie says. Cordelia exits the series ""needed, loved, and wanted""; her final words are ""You're welcome,"" Janine R. Harrison argues, because ""she knows her worth.""

Koen is a second-generation professional wrestler; his father Jackie Koen was also a competitive professional wrestler.

Professional wrestling career

Early career

1987–1989
Shaun Koen was born into a family of athletes in Port Elizabeth, South Africa, the son of promoter and multi-time All-Africa Heavyweight Champion Jackie Koen. He made his debut at the age of sixteen in 1987 for his father's promotion, Ring Promotions, losing to veteran Jumbo Swart in Port Elizabeth. In his second-ever match the next night, he lost to Leon Venter at the Good Hope Centre in Cape Town. On 8 March 1989, he defeated John Powers. On 12 June 1989, he defeated Gary Albright. On 15 November 1989 in a big eight-man tag team match at the Good Hope Centre, he teamed with Danie Brits, Kalahari Boerboel and Tolla The Animal to beat the kayfabe foreign invading team of Tojo Yamamoto, Akam Singh, The Mexican Phantom and Mr India. On 29 November 1989, Koen beat Greg Bragg.

1990–1994
In 1990, he toured the Catch Wrestling Association in Germany and Austria. His experiences wrestling in Europe would greatly influence his style and future training methods. Upon returning to South Africa, he lost to South African Heavyweight Champion Danie Brits on 22 October 1990. On 27 February 1991, Koen defeated Oscar Strongbow. On 29 June 1991, he lost to champion Danie Brits in a match for the South African Heavyweight Title. He lost in a subsequent rematch on 10 July 1991. In 1992, he won the All-Africa Heavyweight Championship from the Zimbabwean Big Mike Zuma in Cape Town, his first major title victory. On 23 January 1992, he defeated German rival Ulf Herman at the Good Hope Centre. On 13 March 1992, Koen beat Mad Mike in Port Elizabeth. On 22 April 1992, he defeated Steve Regal. On 6 May 1992, he teamed with Danie Brits to defeat Jason The Terrible and Steve Regal. On 19 April 1993, he lost to The Barbarian at Good Hope Centre in Cape Town. On 8 September 1994, Koen teamed with Gama Singh to defeat Bad News Allen and Tim Flowers.

In 1994, Koen's father died.

Africa Wrestling Federation / Alliance

1995–1999
In 1995, he formed the Africa Wrestling Federation. Koen would train over thirty of Cape Town's wrestlers in the forthcoming years. The All-Africa Heavyweight Title, which had historic roots in Namibia and had been held by his father, was established as the main championship in the AWF. Upon its founding, the promotion became renowned in regions such as Pretoria and Cape Town, and remained regional until expanding several years later. On 4 February 1995 at an All Stars Wrestling event, he lost to champion Giant Warrior in an EWU Super Heavyweight Title match. On 26 April 1995, he defeated The German Avalanche at the Good Hope Centre. On 19 October 1995, he defeated Bad News Allen.

In 1996 during a tour of Kenya, Koen lost the title to King Jacob, but regained it three weeks later in a no-holds barred challenge. He defended the championship many times against Big Bad Bruce, his arch-rival in the 1990s. In 1999, he formed a dream team with Tornado II, who was on par with Koen in popularity.

2000–2004
In 2001, he suffered a severe arm injury that forced him out of action for almost a year. In 2004 at the height of the AWF's popularity, Shaun Koen and AWF signed their first television contract with nationally broadcast network e.TV. In June that year, Koen lost the title to Terry Middoux, who ended Koen's reign at 3042 days, the longest reign in the title's history. On 11 December 2004, he defeated Middoux on the final episode of the AWF's show AWF on E Slam Series Final to win his record-breaking third All-Africa Heavyweight Title.

2005–2009
In 2005, the Africa Wrestling Federation was renamed the Africa Wrestling Alliance. In December, 2006 at the Parow Civic Centre, he defended the title against rival Missing Link in a match that would be hailed as the most violent in Koen's career, winning after Missing Link was thrown through a table engulfed in fire. Koen would go on to defend the title successfully until 30 April 2008, when he was defeated by Missing Link in a four-way match also involving BDX-Treme and African Warrior. On 9 December 2009 at the Night of Champions event, Koen defeated Missing Link to win his fourth All-Africa Heavyweight Title, breaking his previous record of three reigns in the process.

2010
On 30 March 2010 at the USA vs. RSA show, Koen wrestled Giant Warrior to a double disqualification in his first title defense since reclaiming the All-Africa Heavyweight Title. On 9 June 2010, Koen defended his title successfully against Boerseun. Following the match, he was challenged by professional kickboxer and mixed martial arts star Jan Nortje, who promised to wager all three of his legitimate kickboxing titles against Koen's All-Africa Heavyweight Title in a future match. In August, 2010, the Sanlam-operated online brand SmartAboutWhat.co.za, which focuses on proving whether or not several popular beliefs and myths are real, held a filmed exhibition entitled Is Wrestling Real? at Shaun Koen's training centre in Pinelands, pitting one of their staff writers against Koen and concluding in the end that ""wrestling is indeed real"".

Professional wrestling style and persona
Koen is referred by the nickname ""The Lion of Africa"". His finishing move is the Lion's Claw while he uses a diving leg drop and an enzuigiri.

Most ReBoot characters are named after technical computer terms or pieces of computer hardware.

Main characters

Bob 
Guardian 452 and  the defender of Mainframe from both internal and external threats. Bob is often criticized by other Guardians for his unorthodox views regarding viruses: unlike other Guardians, who believe that viruses should simply be deleted on sight. Bob theorizes that viruses can be reprogrammed to live as Sprites (he cites Hexadecimal as proof of his theories). Despite this criticism, Bob is still respected as one of the finest Guardians ever to come out of the academy. Compared to Dot, he usually does things ""on the fly"", and is an extremely casual and laid-back hero in the first two seasons. After living and partially degrading in the harsh Web (under the alias ""Interface"") he became slightly more cautious, more sensitive and less impulsive than he used to be. Despite the difference in their personalities, he and Dot developed romantic tension that results them in coupling at the end of Season 3.

He is equipped with a Guardian Keytool, ""Glitch"", which can transform into any device with a voice command. When a Guardian is first introduced to a Keytool, they exchange code. In Season 3 and 4, Bob bonds with Glitch (referred to in My Two Bobs as ""Glitch-Bob"") and gains energy-based Keytool powers. As Glitch was broken at the time and because Bob's code was missing from Glitch (Megabyte stole the code from Glitch before crushing it at the end of Season 2) the merger did not quite work. The continued use of his powers (including rebooting) lead to total fragmentation. Eventually they were separated; Glitch now upgraded in design and power regained his original form.

While he was always in favour of non-violent solutions, in Season 4 he opposed to deletion of virals under any circumstances, which caused conflict with other characters like Matrix. The reasons for this change (as he had deleted viral Binomes by destroying ABC craft before) was not directly expressed on the show, but presumably it was the result of both Hexadecimal's reprogramming and his experiences of war-torn Mainframe. At the start of the ""Code of Honor"" webcomic, Turbo accuses Bob of causing a net-wide viral onslaught that has ruined tens of thousands of Systems, claiming his views have caused many Guardians to talk about ""viral rights"", this led to the outbreak and the collective inability to hold it back. Bob left rattled by this, attempted to take out Megabyte in a one-on-one battle before being called back.

Bob was voiced by Michael Benyaer in seasons 1 and 2, and Ian James Corlett in seasons 3 and 4, though Benyaer returned near the end of season 4 as the voice of the fake Bob and eventually as the voice of the real Bob, which led to a tongue-in-cheek comparison between the two where Dot commented that fake Bob ""even sounds more like the real Bob"". He later returns in ReBoot: The Guardian Code where he spots the new generation of Guardian and at first attacks them but later helps them after knowing who they are leading them to the Hexadecimal's lair.

Bob's name was chosen by the members of the production team after they saw an episode of British sitcom Blackadder, and were amused by the way actor Rowan Atkinson pronounced the name Bobs (Blitter Objects), which were also a graphic element in Amiga computer systems.

Dot Matrix 
The daughter of leading Mainframe scientist Welman Matrix, Dot originally was his assistant as a teenager. Now an adult and proprietor of Dot's Diner, Dot also acts as her younger brother Enzo's surrogate parent and guardian since the loss of their father. (What became of their mother is never mentioned in the series.) She later became the command.com of Mainframe in place of Phong. She is admired for her brilliant and invaluable tactical skills, which led to her becoming a workaholic with business interests in most of Mainframe. Although she and Bob took until Season 3 to admit it, they are attracted to one another and this sometimes leads to awkward moments between them. When their father was nullified in the Twin City explosion, Dot and Enzo became each other's only remaining family, and for a long while she was adamant about keeping him from Games.

As Command.Com, she had to fight two successive Viral Wars from a position of inferiority and was forced to make many morally grey decisions, such as having Enzo go into a Game and stay there until he grew into a new Matrix as an insurance policy. It is a sign of her tactical skill that she was able to keep fighting against Megabyte, even with the loss of Enzo and the Principal Office, and then be able to cause some serious damage to Daemon. The emotional stress of the Viral Wars took their toll after the defeat of Daemon, and she fell for Megabyte's plan to impersonate the original Bob out of a desire to get back to the good times and forget all the pain and horror. After this, she came up with a plan that captured Megabyte and his entire Neo-Viral army in one swoop, but this was undone when it was revealed they had only caught a copy of Megabyte and the real virus was inside the War Room.

Dot was voiced by Kathleen Barr. She also made an appearance in ReBoot: The Guardian Code along with Bob and Enzo while the new generations of Guardians entered Mainframe.

Her name is a reference to the method of using an array of dots to generate characters, symbols and images. The dot matrix was once widely used in the form of dot matrix displays and dot matrix printers. It is possible that her name may also be a hidden reference to a sentient machine with an identical name from the film Spaceballs.

Enzo Matrix 
Dot's little brother, Enzo, hero-worships Bob and intends to become a Guardian. He has a crackling, mid-pubescent voice and often uses catch-phrases such as ""alphanumeric"" and ""high-density"" in place of real-world utterances like ""cool"" and ""awesome"" to express enthusiasm. Enzo is very energetic and loves to play games like Jet Ball and Circuit Racing, and eagerly heads into the Games. Despite his youth, Enzo has proven to be extremely good at the Games and has several times been responsible for winning them.

With the destruction of the Twin City, most of Mainframe's Sprites were nullified and Enzo grew up with few friends to play with (it is unknown why he did not have Binome friends; presumably they avoided him because of his father's supposed role in the Twin City's destruction). His main friend growing up was Frisket until he met AndrAIa and brought her to Mainframe. The two have become inseparable since then.

Guardian Matrix 
When the Web invaded, Bob gave him a field rank as Guardian Cadet with the promise of sending him to the Super-Computer to be a real Guardian; when Bob was lost in the Web, Enzo found himself as the defender of Mainframe. He did well, gaining self-confidence and the approval of the populace, but eventually a Game came down he could not win, leading to his development into Matrix. When Mainframe was rebooted at the end of Season 3, Matrix had accidentally left his icon in ""Game Sprite"" mode, causing the system to recognize Enzo as missing, and so created a second Enzo using the last available data on him, which was some time before the episode ""Talent Night"".

It is revealed in ""Talent Night"" that the number on his shirt refers to his age, as written in binary notation, as it changes from ""01"" to ""10"" at the end of the episode.

Matrix 
Adult Enzo Matrix, who, due to the dimensional difference of the game world (in the middle of season 3) aged quicker, making the time frame in the game world seem longer than it actually is. Ashamed of the child he used to be, whom he viewed as weak after his vicious defeat by the User Zaytan, he prefers to be addressed by his surname ""Matrix"" instead of his given name, which reminds him of his childhood. With a cold and gritty personality, violent behavior and a ""built-like-a-tank"" physique (so physically built, in fact, that he was able to match Megabyte physically in a fight) he is nothing like the child he used to be. He was tempered by what was from his perspective a lifetime of fighting. Although he is quick to anger he has still shown a desire to help those in need (albeit in a very gruff and violent way) and his quest to return to Mainframe has let him bring many systems back from the brink of annihilation. He harbors an unparalleled hatred towards viruses and will not hesitate to delete them in a violent and merciless manner. He is in love with AndrAIa, who has now matured as well, but is also quite jealous and protective of her. Deep down, he had a fear that he might become or already be a hate-driven, uncaring killer who had forgotten about his home and family and would end up like Megabyte; he had to face his fears and get past them in the episode ""Number Seven"" (based on The Prisoner). He would several times show an extreme temper, aiming a gun at Ray Tracer during arguments, and he instinctively raises his gun when surprised by something that might possibly be dangerous (including if he is bumped into).

His right eye was severely damaged in the lost game that took him from Mainframe, but was at some point replaced with a cybernetic eye during his travels. This eye grants him extended visual powers, such as magnified long-range vision and X-ray vision. Matrix has also acquired a firearm, the aptly named ""Gun"", which has many functions that Matrix invokes with voice commands. Gun operates in a fashion similar to a Guardian Keytool, possibly because Matrix idolized Bob as a child. Matrix's mechanical eye also works in conjunction with Gun for lock-on targeting and tracking purposes. One of his gun's functions is ""Death Blossom Mode"" (a reference to the movie, The Last Starfighter) which allows the gun to hover in midair spinning rapidly in 720 degrees autolocking to all targets in sight. It is being implied that the gun has extremely high caliber, from single solitary blasts to Full-Delete rounds among possible explosive capabilities when he is seen shooting pursuing ships from the Saucy Mare, a ship he recovered for the Crimson Binome to travel to the Web. Matrix also carried Bob's damaged Guardian Keytool, Glitch, having recovered it as Enzo after Megabyte launched Bob into the Web; although this was mostly symbolic, as Glitch was rendered virtually nonfunctional, Matrix did continue to use Glitch for stats and information about games and systems he encountered. Matrix returned Glitch to Bob when they were re-united in the Web.

In a sign of development, Matrix finally spared a virus's life by not killing Megabyte when he was beaten and at his mercy. Having spent so long apart from Mainframe, he is filled with the desire to defend his home by any means necessary, making it seem as though Matrix had become much more belligerent during the first part of Season 4, and this stance caused a great deal of friction between him and Bob in Daemon Rising. Once Daemon was beaten, the two were much more friendly to each other, though Matrix was always having to deal with anxieties of what to do now there was no-one left to fight.

While he sometimes views the young copy Enzo as somewhat of an annoyance and grim reminder of what he used to be, he has come to accept the young Enzo as a little brother and strives to prevent him from becoming like himself.

With his tough-guy attitude, similar look (missing eye, sleeveless vest, and fingerless gloves), and imitative dialogue (""Call me Matrix!""), Matrix is likely inspired by the character of Snake Plissken, or possibly the gruff, muscular, gun-toting, anti-hero, Cable, of Marvel Comic's X-Men franchise. Despite Matrix's appearance, his actual age is only ""11"" (in binary) due to accelerated game time.

Matrix was voiced by Paul Dobson.

Little Enzo 
The new Enzo looks up to his older self as much as he does Bob, and briefly wanted to be just like him and demanded everyone call him ""Little Matrix"". When Daemon took over Mainframe, Enzo (whilst wearing the Guardian uniform that Bob gave the original Enzo in season two) saved the System with the help of Frisket, Hack and Slash, getting Matrix to snap out of Daemon's infection and help disinfect others so they could fight the virus.

By the start of the ""Code of Honor"" webcomic, he's already become a Guardian Cadet and is the star pupil of the academy. He's gained a next-gen keytool named Sparc, though it will only work for him when he proves he has ""the heart of a Guardian"".

Frisket 
A feral dog who likes Enzo, who acts in a threatening manner toward just about everyone other than Enzo and AndrAIa, with a particular dislike of Bob. Frisket has uncanny physical strength, comparable to that of Megabyte, being known to catch cannonballs (and ABCs) in his teeth. Frisket is extremely loyal to Enzo and would not hesitate to sacrifice his life to protect Enzo's. Frisket followed Enzo and AndrAIa into the games during season three.

His name is derived from the masking technique that is used by artists. Frisket was voiced by Scott McNeil. He later made a cameo appearance in ReBoot: The Guardian Code except this time he's a little nervous and afraid then his previous years and was the first one to saw Megabyte in his upgraded form before fleeing from him.

Phong 
System administrator and keeper of the core for Mainframe who lives and studies in the Principal Office. He was also the command.com of Mainframe until passing the title to Dot. A wise old Italian sprite somewhat evocative of Confucius, he often dispenses advice in the form of confusing and vague philosophical quotes gleaned from old README files. Very fond of Pong, one must defeat him in a game to be considered worthy of his knowledge. Phong is immune to infection by  viruses, but not super-viruses (Megabyte was never able to infect him, but Daemon infected him quite easily). When the Viral Wars started, Phong was an invaluable aide and comforter to Dot. He was captured by Megabyte, his head cut off (it was later reattached), and had data extracted from his mind, but he refused to surrender and fought Megabyte to the last. One of his passwords was revealed to be ""Yaddi Yaddi Yadda!""

Phong always has the right equipment or knowledge, often handy in whatever sort of situation; in one episode, Bob was shocked to find that Phong had prepared a countermeasure specifically to handle a giant monster made entirely of Nulls stomping around the city. He acts a wise therapist whom many come to for advice about their problems, but the majority of the time his advice isn't very helpful and he urges for sprites to figure things out on their own.

The character Phong's name is an allusion to the game Pong—he has a rule that any who seek his advice must first play him in a game of physical Pong, shown on-screen in the first few episodes—and to Phong shading, an interpolation method (itself named after computer scientist Bui Tuong Phong) used in three-dimensional graphics rendering. Phong shading was used to render this character, as opposed to the simpler Gouraud shading used on other characters.

Main villains

Megabyte 
The main antagonist of the series, Megabyte (voiced by Tony Jay) is a virus, originally operating out of the Silicon Tor in Sector 1000 and dominating most of G-Prime. Megabyte plots constantly to corrupt and control Mainframe in order to turn it into his own domain, ""Megaframe"", and from there infect the Super-Computer and then take the entire Net. His secondary objective is to destroy his sister Hexadecimal, which is apparently just viral sibling rivalry. He is a malignant virus able to infect other programs, and commands an army of infected Viral Binomes. He has a brutal, almost psychopathic nature and speaks with a deep British accent. Megabyte possesses fantastic physical strength, super agility and reflexes as well as the ability to jump great distances. He can quickly scale high walls with vicious Wolverine-like extendable claws on his knuckles, as well as finger tips with extending nails similar to Lady Deathstrike. He has an exceedingly cunning intellect as well as the ability to infect and control objects. Another ability he has shown is the ability to read memory from certain sprites, namely Phong (Infected). He also manages to steal Bob's exchanged Guardian code with Glitch. Megabyte has no sense of morality and consistently takes advantage of others to achieve his own ends. He also seems immune to the energy-draining effect of nulls (as he has been seen holding his pet null ""Nibbles"", whom he once called ""Father""). Megabyte can also store codes to control programs and functions of what ever system he is in, provided he has been given said codes.  These programs are controlled by buttons located under a panel in his left arm.

Megabyte also has a sense of humor and musical talents, as shown in the episode ""Talent Night"" when he crashed into Enzo's birthday party, accompanied by armed guards, but instead of his usual evil antics, he began to play a rock song on a forked guitar, which led to his and Bob's famous rock duel. Afterwards, Megabyte remarked ""I've always wanted to do that"", and left, but not before giving Enzo his guitar as a birthday gift.

Megabyte's origin is revealed in the fourth season. He and Hexadecimal were once one virus (Killabyte), who was scheduled for deletion by the Guardians, but upgraded into Gigabyte before it could be carried out. He mortally wounded Bob's partner and moved in toward Bob before being accidentally teleported away by Welman Matrix's gateway device. The results were devastating: the destruction of Mainframe's twin city (creating Lost Angles), everyone present being nullified (including Welman, who became Nibbles), and Gigabyte being split into Megabyte and Hexadecimal. Upon being separated, Megabyte observed his surroundings and walked off – intent to carry out his agenda on an unsuspecting city.

While always a villain, in earlier episodes Megabyte was often involved in humorous situations and rarely caused permanent damage; the exception to this was the first episode, ""The Tearing"", where he deliberately causes a whole Sector to be nullified. As time went on, and especially after ReBoot was no longer on the ABC Network, he became far more evil. He appears to have some small sense of honor, shown in one instance when Bob saves his life, Megabyte later let Dot go in the same episode, after which he commented ""Now, we are even"".

In the final episode of Season 2, Megabyte worked with Mainframe to close the Web portal that had opened in Mainframe, but not without heavy cost. Unfortunately, just before his ""hardware"" was fired at the portal to close it, he threw Bob into a rocket and sent it soaring into the portal. The portal was then closed, and he had his army move to crush the remaining defenders (CPUs) of Mainframe. For the first three episodes of Season 3 he had complete air supremacy and full run of Mainframe, while its defenders were trapped in the Principal Office. He also left Enzo alive so he could launch a propaganda campaign focusing on how the Guardian was an inexperienced boy, thus demoralizing the denizens of Mainframe. Obscenely, he also imprisoned Hexadecimal and forced her into becoming a living weapon, electrocuting her viciously via a collar at the slightest whim. ""Rather good, isn't it?"", he remarked to Enzo about his latest ""weapon"".

He was finally trapped behind an inverted Firewall that covered all of G-Prime. Unfortunately, shortly afterwards a rampaging Hexadecimal took out the Firewall; resulting in war between the viruses that devastated G-Prime (including the Tor) and neighboring Sectors.  Needing a new base, and as the Principal Office shields were still offline (having been deactivated to provide energy for the Firewall) Megabyte was able to conquer it by force. Mainframe became Megabyte's long sought after Megaframe. Instead of re-building it ""in his own image"" (as he so frequently says), he more left it as a decaying and devastated system that was perpetually on the verge of crashing. When Matrix and Bob returned to the system, Mainframe's rebels were finally able to bring down the Viral forces. During the battle, Megabyte was confronted by Matrix, who was carrying his sidearm: Gun. Megabyte convinced Matrix to drop his weapon and fight him hand-to-hand, as the virus believed that ""the boy"" would be no match for him physically.  However, this was proven to be false when Matrix ultimately defeated him in battle. Megabyte was enraged when Matrix spared his life, and as an act of desperation he tried to escape to the Super-Computer. However, Mouse managed to change the address of the portal Megabyte was using, and as a result he was trapped in the Web. He made a brief return in the form of a holographic simulation, which Megabyte had created to taunt anyone who went into the System's Core to prevent it from crashing.

Megabyte survived in the Web due to sharing some of Bob's Guardian code, and in the fourth season he became a Trojan Horse virus, gaining the ability to look and sound like any sprite or binome he is able to steal code from. He returned from the Web in the form of Bob circa Seasons 1–2, deliberately trying to confuse everyone over who the real Bob was in order to attack his enemies emotionally. He had also switched objectives from world conquest to personal revenge. His plan worked so well, he almost ended up married to Dot, until Glitch retook Bob's stolen code and forced him back into his Viral form. Megabyte immediately fought the real Bob, but he was surprised by Bob's increased power and was forced to retreat.

Afterwards, Megabyte began building an army of Neo-Virals, but was swiftly captured by the CPUs along with his whole horde, or so everyone thought. That Megabyte was in fact an alias, a fragile copy of himself, while the real Megabyte had infiltrated the Principal Office in the form of Frisket. He swiftly infected the War Room and had his enemies isolated throughout the building, telling them to prepare for ""the Hunt"".

At the start of the Code of Honor webcomic, he'd devastated Mainframe with his armies of infected ""zombinomes"" that the entire System was evacuated. He was seemingly killed when the firmware upgrade Gnosis was unleashed on Mainframe, but the second issue ended with him revealed still alive and working for Gnosis as an avatar created from Gnosis.

Megabyte has an unusual habit of separating his torso from his legs when he is plotting at the Tor, and has a hovering chair to move him around when in this state.

He has been in Games five times, showing the ability to infect the User's in-game avatar. His last two Games were played when he was disguised as Bob; he was able to reboot and handled the Games quite well, though he asked Matrix to cheat in Panzu Heavy X (My Two Bobs) when panicked about the number of opponents. His Game appearance in ""Bad Bob"", when a corrupted Game merged him with and a device stealing the Core energy, was the Megatruck. Bob drove him in this episode, and was alarmed to discover the Megatruck had no brakes.

His name is a reference to a megabyte.

He appears as a recurring villain in ReBoot: The Guardian Code where he is resurrected by a villainous hacker known as the Sourcerer in the real world as his agent when he was destroyed for unknown reasons and was given a new upgrade that made him stronger and a new look by him.

Nibbles 
Megabyte's pet null, whom he refers to as ""Father"" several times throughout the series. Nibbles' identity as a Sprite does not become clear until the fourth season.

His name is a reference to a nibble or nybble, 1/2 of a byte.

Hack and Slash 
Hack (voiced by Phil Hayes in season one, Scott McNeil in season two) and Slash (voiced by Garry Chalk) are twin robots, identical in form except that Hack is red and Slash is blue. The pair originally served Megabyte, carrying out his orders, often in a very incompetent manner - their first appearance had Bob tricking them into crashing into each other. By Season 2, they had degraded in villainy to the point where they twice ask Bob for help (the episode ""Bad Bob"", when trapped on a speeding Megatruck, and  the episode ""Nullzilla"" after losing Megabyte's pet null) and also assist him in battling Gigabyte (saving him at one point). Hack and Slash have great physical strength. They once lifted and destroyed a very large bridge with ease in the episode Medusa, and both proved strong enough to punch the greatly sized Gigabyte out to the floor, or even high and far up in the sky. Hack is also once seen to have three arms.

In Season 3, they reconsidered their loyalties after being instructed to kill Cyrus, who had betrayed Megabyte. Though both were reluctant to carry out those orders, Slash freed Cyrus at the last moment. When Hack pointed out how mad Megabyte would be, Slash responded, ""Ah, what's new? I miss Bob. Bob always stopped us before we did anything really bad. Now, nobody does"". Meanwhile, Megabyte had grown weary of their incompetence and ordered them to take point when battling Hexadecimal. They were promptly blown to bits. Phong found and repaired them (as well as gave them PIDs), and they switched sides to Mainframe to work as bodyguards and gofers for Dot. Hack and Slash were the first regular characters to re-encounter the returned Bob and Matrix, and they were quite overjoyed to see them again.

In Season 4, they were often seen hanging around Enzo and helped him play a key role in stopping Daemon. They also assisted in a Game, the first one they were shown in since acquiring PiDs. Also, Hack refused to allow Slash to mention the ""M"" word out of fear that their old boss would ever come back. When Megabyte did return and began fighting Bob, Hack and Slash were unsure of whom to help. Later, they flew away screaming at the idea someone might be Megabyte. The two were last seen taking Dot out of the Command Center (and panicking), as Megabyte took over the Principal Office.

Hack and Slash are frequently torn apart, although they seem to take it in stride. They used to talk in very babbling and over-running dialogue, but halfway through Season 2 they became more coherent. They are quite dimwitted and bumbling, despite their strength. They have built-in jetpacks that allow them to perform and maintain VTOL flight. They can also control their limbs remotely - they often get blown up and can still operate every movable part even though they are literally in a thousand pieces.

Their names are a reference to the hack and slash genre of computer games, and the keyboard characters \ (hack) and / (slash).

Hexadecimal 
Hexadecimal (voiced by Shirley Millner), the self-proclaimed ""Queen of Chaos"", is a virus operating out of Lost Angles. She is Megabyte's sister, serving as the chaos to his order. Her origin is revealed in the fourth season. She and Megabyte were once one virus (Killabyte), who was scheduled for deletion by the Guardians, but upgraded to Gigabyte before it could be carried out. He mortally wounded Bob's partner and moved in toward Bob before being accidentally teleported away by Welman Matrix's gateway device. The results were devastating: the destruction of Mainframe's twin city (creating Lost Angles), everyone present being nullified (including Welman, who became Nibbles), and Gigabyte being split into Megabyte and Hexadecimal. Upon being separated, Hexadecimal observed her surroundings and (with a mask change) exclaimed, ""I like it here!"".

Hexadecimal is melodramatic and extremely emotional, able to switch emotions by a simple wave of her hand (which changes the noh-styled mask she wears, and her emotions along with it). The masks change constantly in a slew of different ways, usually while obscured from the home viewer. Episodes 1 and 10 of season 2, and episode 4 of season 3 showed her mask changing on screen in an instant. She has transfinite power reserves, meaning that she has near limitless stores of energy to draw from, and as such, is quite powerful herself. Her powers include energy beams and fireballs, altering gravity (once causing Bob to stop and hover in midair) and being able to fly, shrugging off severe damage and controlling nulls (sprites downgraded to slug-like status for losing to the User in a game). She also has the power to open a portal to the net or web in her ""looking glass"", and has also been seen taking control of system programs like the system paint program. It is suggested that her powers are near infinite, but because of her madness she is unable to use them for anything constructive.

Her vast collection of masks serve to show her facial expression, thereby giving her a harlequin-like appearance. The expressions shown in these masks can range from happy, sad, scheming, and even homicidal rage. These masks also hold her power in check. When removed (as in the episode ""Painted Windows""), her power escapes and continues to do damage to her environment, and she will overload and be destroyed if the mask is not replaced.

She is a benign virus, meaning she does not infect other entities. Instead, her primary motive is to simply cause random chaos for fun (and also to kill Megabyte, who kept trying to kill her, likely due to simple sibling rivalry). Due to her power and insanity, her fun nearly always led to Mainframe crashing. She even once nearly caused it unwittingly, when a Web Creature emerged from her mirror and possessed her. All of the nulls sensed this danger and covered her completely. The giant ""Nullzilla"" monster went on a rampage, as (according to Dot) the possessed-Hexadecimal was trying to escape.

In Web World Wars, Hexadecimal was charged with powering the Hardware that closed the web portal. Despite her interest in Bob, she knew of Megabyte's impending betrayal and even helped launch him into the Web. After closing the portal, she aimed the Hardware at the Principal Office. Megabyte merely saw this as a threat to force the Mainframers compliance to his whims, but she wanted to destroy the Core – not caring that that would destroy the entire System, including herself. Luckily, a Game Cube landed on top of the Hardware and the energy feedback from the Cube, along with the energy charge that she had already infused in the hardware, seriously damaged her. Megabyte subsequently had her rebuilt and had her enslaved as a weapon he could use against Mainframe (via a collar around her neck that caused her extreme pain when she did not comply with his wishes). This served only to further elevate her rage against Megabyte. Though she appeared to be completely restrained, Herr Doktor theorized she was faking and ""liked being tied up"", which Megabyte preferred not to think about. When she finally did escape Megabyte's control, her ""rattling of her brother's bones"" devastated G-Prime and the surrounding sectors. Spending the rest of her days lurking in Lost Angles, she made her presence known again with the return of Bob.

When Bob returned, she abducted him for demented party games and would eventually have killed him. However, he was able to defragment her head with his new powers. His glitch powers were able to replace her masks and her insanity with a real face (which looked exactly like her masks, but was able to move) and more harmless quirkiness. However, she still felt the need to off Herr Doktor and Bunnyfoot vengefully (and comedically) by turning them into biscuits. In the episode End Prog, with the System about to restart, Bob insisted that Phong give Hex an Icon (or PID) to register her with the Principal Office so she would be backed up. Mainframe restarted and a viral scan disinfected all the Virals, but Hexadecimal (with the icon) remained intact, remarking that the scan merely tickled.

Hex being her nickname for short, could also refer to her dark powers, and the Medusa Bug she used as a curse against everyone, in Web World Wars, Mouse comments referring to Hex, ""Just tell the witch to be ready!"", to which Hex responded, ""I heard that! What a sweet thing to say!"".

By Daemon Rising, she had begun openly and heavily trying to seduce Bob. In order to make him happy, she used her powers to drive out Daemon's forces; this weakened her powers enough for the viral scan, which had remained in her Icon, to start again, and she covered herself with Nulls to stop it. When the Null-cocoon fled as a Game landed on her, she became a normal, powerless Sprite; wearing a new costume of white lace and gold instead of black leather and red, with normal-looking eyes and black hair.

Strangely enough, Hex retained her control over Nulls, even though the rest of her powers had been stripped away. Upon revealing her origin to Dot, she began referring to her as ""Sis"". When Daemon conquered Mainframe, Hex was rejected as an abomination by Daemon for abandoning her viral code. At the end of the episode ""Sacrifice"", with Bob in danger of dying, she had given away her new life as a pure Sprite to become her old reckless and insane viral self just to stop Daemon. To do this, she absorbed Mainframe's core energy with the help of Phong, and became as powerful as Daemon herself to try to stop the infection. She did not succeed unfortunately, as Daemon's ""cron virus"" (a virus defined to attack at a specific time) took hold of the Net. ""Ill"" again, Hex did not realize the severity of the situation until Bob told her that she would not survive the crash, and she made the decision to fragment herself into the Net as a ""benign virus"" to undo everything that Daemon had done. She took the cure from Matrix's icon and then gave the young Enzo a special code on his icon that would later give his null-father the ability to talk once more. Before she went in, she told Bob that she had always loved him and told Dot to take care of him.

Her sacrifice symbolizes two themes previously stated in the show. ""Love conquers all boundaries"" (AndrAIa, S4 episode 3): Hexadecimal decides to fight Daemon's countdown due to her love for Bob and desire for him to survive. ""Chaos will always triumph over Order; it is the way of things"" (""Game Over""); Daemon's purpose is stated by Turbo to bring order to the Net, and the self-styled Queen of Chaos fights her to a standstill and cures the Net of the infection.

Her name is a reference to hexadecimal notation. She later returns in Reboot the Guardians Code where she has returned for unknown reasons and has been in Lost Angles bored with no one but herself until Megabyte returns in his new look and offers his sister to join him in conquering cyberspace and leaving Mainframe.

Scuzzy 
Hexadecimal's familiar. A cat-sized animal with a video screen on its head. Named after SCSI, which stands for Small Computer System Interface. Scuzzy is last seen in ""Firewall"".

The User 
The human operator of Mainframe is perceived by its denizens as a distant, impersonal, deity-like figure. Often destructive, it subjects the city to Game Cubes and assumes various avatars to do deadly battle with the unfortunates trapped within them. In layman's terms, the User is a computer owner that enjoys playing PC games, blissfully unaware of the havoc they are causing. Nonetheless, Mainframers dutifully petition the User to bestow upon them gifts such as increased memory and software upgrades, prayers which are sometimes answered despite the User's sadly limited means. Of all the characters depicted, only Fax Modem openly professed to deny the existence of the User, a position roundly regarded as wildly unorthodox and borderline insane. The User never appears on screen, although in the third-season finale its keystrokes could be heard as it entered the command to reboot the system. In the season finale of The Guardian Code, the User is finally revealed to be an overweight, bearded man who still lives with his mother and plays games in her basement.

Season one characters

Cecil 
 A video screen with a pair of arms, waiter at Dot's Diner before it was destroyed. Stereotypical French waiter complete with small moustache. He refers to himself as a ""dedicated server"", a play on his waiter job and Server (Computing). He greatly resembles the original Apple Macintosh, even his icon has rainbow stripes resembling the Macintosh logo. Although nearly the entire cast pronounces his name Cee-Cil, he has repeatedly asserted that it is actually pronounced Ceh-cil. (Unlike the rest of the cast, Dot pronounces it correctly.)  Cecil was originally limited to moving along a rail within the Diner (in other words, he was nearly sessile); after the Diner's destruction, Cecil's rail arm was attached to a hoverboard, allowing him freedom of movement,The Cecil Hotel in Vancouver was fairly close to MainFrame Productions Studio, and the logo on Cecil's chest also closely resembles that club's logo.

Al's Diner 
Al owns Al's Diner (also known as Al's Wait & Eat) on Level 31, and also serves as cook. According to his waiter, Al runs at 3 decahertz (30 Hz). Almost never seen, the only times he is explicitly shown on screen is when he is tied and completely covered up with rope in the episode ""The Great Brain Robbery"", and jumps in front of the camera in the third-season finale after the system is restored, having been apparently sped up he offers a fast and excited ""Woo-hoo!"" to the viewer. He is a one-binome with a chef's hat. One running gag throughout the series is that whenever his name is said, whether someone is directly talking to him, or his name is just mentioned in conversation, he responds with ""What?"".

 Al's Waiter (Front Counter)  Never named in the series, he is a binome that stands behind the counter at Al's Diner. He speaks and acts very slowly. He is one of the sprites who disappears in ""Trust No One"". He was also the first to be infected by the returned Megabyte in Season 4.

 Al's Waiter (Roller Skater)  Also never addressed by name, he is flamboyant one-binome who acts stereotypically camp. Has made Bob a bit uncomfortable on a few occasions.

Mike the TV 
 An annoying, ambulatory television set from Bob's apartment who is constantly pitching bizarre products (like the famous Bucket-O-Nothing, free for only $99.99.99) or simply rambling on until somebody shouts at him to shut up. He is a seemingly obvious reference to Charlie and the Chocolate Factory´s Mike Teavee. Speaking into a mic, he appears at random moments to irritate the rest of the cast. His remote control ran away, so he cannot be turned off. He temporarily lived in Hexadecimal's lair when Bob left him with her in order to ""cheer her up"" after the events of Painted Windows. Mike keeps the secret that it is his fault the web creature was released into Mainframe - when he played an opera for Hexadecimal, a singer's high note shattered her mirror and allowed the creature to get her - and thus he is (indirectly) responsible for everything that happens after that. Mike apparently joined Scuzzy as her helper. He stayed in her lair until he, Scuzzy, Hack, and Slash were scared away by Nullzilla and met up with Bob. In later seasons, he stars as a war correspondent for Mainframe, and during his brief infection by Daemon becomes a televangelist.

 In the episode Enzo The Smart, Enzo slows the ""clock cycles"" of all the sprites making them dumber than they actually are. Mike the TV was the only character not affected because, as Enzo noted, he could not get any dumber.

Herr Doktor and Bunnyfoot 
 Megabyte's pair of one-binome evil scientists whose practices are disturbingly unethical. The Herr's hands are unlike any other binomes'; instead of mitten-like hands, he has actual fingers. This distinction is continually featured as comic relief in the series. The Doktor's fingers will be run over or somehow damaged, he will shout, ""Mein digits!"", and his hands will appear in bandages for the rest of the episode. Unlike the other Virals, he retained his Viral status and colors after Mainframe was restarted. The Herr's assistant Bunnyfoot is, in relation to other binomes, anatomically dishevelled, with his eye portion in the middle (he is a one binome rather than a zero binome) and has a brick as a foot, referencing Igor, the assistant of Doctor Victor Frankenstein who occasionally appears in some adaptations of Frankenstein. The pair were later turned into biscuits by a vengeful Hexidecimal but were restored when The User rebooted the system. Her Doktor was later seen as a Neo Viral though Bunnyfoot is unseen. Megabyte disguised himself as Her Doktor to escape custody.

Old Man Pearson 
 Old Man Pearson (voiced by Long John Baldry) wns a waste disposal system (analogous to a Windows Recycle Bin) and data dump in Sector 1001. Pearson is a cranky old binome with an Irish accent and is the former Codemaster known as Talon. As a Codemaster, Pearson possesses a Gibson Coil Pike weapon, a reference to science fiction writer William Gibson.

 He may have been named for one of ReBoot's co-creators, Ian Pearson.

Captain Gavin Capacitor 
Capain Gavin Capacitor (voiced by Long John Baldry) software pirate and captain of the Saucy Mare, he styles himself as ""the Crimson Binome"".

 Capacitor is a one-binome armed with a hook for a left hand and a peg leg in place of his right leg. He fits the pirate stereotype perfectly, complete with pirate catchphrase mutations such as ""Shiver me templates!"" and ""By the code!"" At heart, he is a romantic, driven at times by a sense of honor, comradeship and a desire to never go down without fighting. Captain Capacitor was referenced to Long John Silver and Captain Hook.

 He and his crew were only in the pirate game for the profit, raiding the Ports of Systems with lightning speed and co-ordination, but this ended when they arrived in Mainframe and Dot showed him that he could make more profit by legitimate business. Gavin then became a business partner of Mainframe until its Net Ports closed after the Web invasion. He did not get the chance to find new Systems to trade with, as Daemon took over and the Saucy Mare was forced to go on the run.

 The pirates teamed up with Matrix, AndrAIa and Ray Tracer, entering the Web to find and retrieve Bob. From there, they returned to Mainframe and assisted Dot's rebels in the war against Megabyte. To Gavin's regret, he had to sacrifice the Mare in order to wipe out Megabyte's remaining airforce, and mourned its passing. After the System restart, he worked on unrevealed missions designed to harry Daemon.

 His last name is a reference to capacitors. His first name is clarified to be a reference to ReBoot co-creator Gavin Blair (in the art book, he used Gavin Capacitor as his image, and all three co-creators had one character named after them in previous episodes).

The Crew of the Saucy Mare 
 Mr. Christopher Captain Capacitor's bookkeeper is a nerdy and timid zero-binome who's never seen without his laptop. His name is likely a tribute to Fletcher Christian, the Master's Mate from HMS Bounty. He may have also been named after Christopher Brough, president of Mainframe Entertainment. Mr. Christopher was referenced to Mr. Smee. 

 Princess Bula A giant one-binome on Captain Capacitor's crew with great physical strength, but she isn't very smart. Not actually a princess, but no one dares say otherwise. Mr. Christopher has a crush on her.

 Miss Sally A female zero-binome pirate who serves as raider and look-out for the Mare. She once stole Glitch.

 Mr. Andrew The one-binome pirate in charge of the steering wheel of Mare, who wears an eye-patch over his single eye. He was present during the search of Bob in the Web and at the Restart of Mainframe.

 Mr. Jimmy A zero-binome who is in charge of the ship's prison.

 Mr. Mitchell A wealthy one-binome whose appearance and manner recall Thurston Howell, III, in the sitcom Gilligan's Island.

 He may have been named for one of ReBoot's co-creators, Phil Mitchell.

Mouse 
 Mouse (voiced by Louise Vallance) knew Bob from back when he arrested her from trying to hack into the Super-Computer. A hacker extraordinaire with a sugary Southern accent, she is equipped with a katana to cut her enemies into small pieces, and a high-tech craft called Ship. Sometimes she is seen with another, smaller sword, but she rarely uses it. It is probably a wakizashi to complete a samurai's daisho, which consists of the two aforementioned swords.  She is first mentioned in the episode ""The Crimson Binome"", which hints at an untold encounter between Mouse and the pirate crew of the Saucy Mare; Bob, imprisoned in the ship's brig, finds Mouse's calling card (a stylized drawing of a mouse) on the wall, a clue to an avenue of escape.  She first appears on-screen in ""The Great Brain Robbery"", hired as a mercenary by Megabyte (during the episode, she calls him ""big guy"" and ""Megababe""); she turned against him when it became obvious she had been double-crossed and was endangering a young child. She later returned in Season 2 to save Bob and Dot from Gigabyte and ended up as part of the main cast from then on. She had been hired by the Guardians to discover if there was a Web Creature in Mainframe; during the subsequent Web War and then the Viral Wars, Mouse's hacking skills became a major asset in thwarting Mainframe's enemies, including developing a Firewall so complex that Daemon could not get through it, and was blocked from multiple Systems.  Due to her invaluable assistance, Mouse is allowed to upgrade her icon (and AndrAIa's as well) to a full Mainframe icon which, among other things, created a backup of her that allowed her to be restored along with the native Mainframers after the system crashed (""End Prog"").

 Mouse's canines are developed into what looks like fangs, as specified in the episode ""Trust No One""; she is capable of snarling in a very animal-like way, displaying these canines as a threat posture. In ""The Great Brain Robbery"", she growls in a feral fashion at Megabyte when he tells her that he ""doublecrosses whomever he pleases"". She becomes a dear friend to Dot as one whom Dot can confide into and lean on when no one else is around; during Dot's wedding, Mouse was her Sprite of Honor. At some point between the episodes ""End Prog"" and ""Daemon Rising"", Mouse begins dating Ray Tracer.

 In the current webcomic, Mouse and Ray were both apparently killed in the same battle that claimed the life of Turbo. However, when Gnosis restored the net it is likely that they were both restored, as well.

 Her name is a reference to the computer mouse.

Binky and Algernon 
 Sir Algernon Cholmondley-Worthington III and Binky Ffarquarson, also known as the British Binomes, appear in several episodes acting as pilots and very stereotypically British. In times of mortal peril they utter such lines as ""steady on"", ""jolly good"", ""fancy a biscuit"" and ""I'll put a brew on"". The plane they are piloting almost always gets shot down in some way. These characters are possibly modelled on Biggles and friends.

Cyrus 
 A one-binome that worked for Megabyte on his own free will without having been infected. In Season 1, he was helping Dot rescue and reformat an entire Sector in order to free it from Megabyte, but defected for mercenary reasons and helped Megabyte try to steal all of the PIDs in the Sectors so that they could be infected. The plan went bottom-up, and Cyrus was infected and turned into Megabyte's boot-shiner. In Season 3 he was put in charge of a propaganda campaign against Enzo's ability to act as guardian, designed to demoralize Enzo and the general population. However, when both he and Enzo ended up in a game, Cyrus was forced to help defeat the User; when he discovered Enzo wanted his help and trusted him despite all he had done, he not only helped, but also saved Enzo's life. In this game he rebooted into Dick Dastardly, and Frisket rebooted as Muttely who snickered at Cyrus' disapproval of being Dastardly. His redemption did not last long, as Megabyte recaptured him as the Firewall went up and ordered his execution. Cyrus escaped thanks to Slash, but he was horrified to find no way out of G-Prime. Somehow, he and Scuzzy found a way to breach the Firewall, allowing him to escape and Scuzzy to enter to free Hexadecimal. However, a very happy and disinfected Cyrus is seen leading the chorus line's dance in the musical number at the end of Season 3.

Season two characters

Lens 
 Codemaster Lens appears in one episode (""High Code"") of the original series, but is a pivotal character in the webcomic continuation. He is a Net-born member of the Codemasters, one of the most feared and dangerous sects in cyberspace, who operate out of a city hidden in the depths of the Super-Computer.

 Lens is a system bug, who was made an outcast when the User decided he was a mistake. He eventually became a Codemaster, possibly after having sought refuge in the refugee community outside the Codemaster's city. He later came to Mainframe to challenge Codemaster Talon, who had taken refuge in Mainframe, but is known to the Mainframers as ""Old Man Pearson"". Amazed by the Mainframers determination to stand by Pearson, he left the System in peace.

 Lens had a distinct code of honor, barely spoke to other characters, and was described as a terrifying hunter by Phong. Using his Gibson-Coil pike, he was able to teleport, knock over buildings, wield energy bludgeons, and imprison Bob's Keytool, Glitch, behind a force field. Lens refers to himself as belonging to ""The Sixty-Second Brotherhood"", and by the titles ""the Reaper"" and ""the Clear Unfolding"".

 He returns in the first issue of ReBoot: Code of Honor, initially as part of the Guild's delegation to meet the Guardians and reveal their Gnosis super-weapon. As with the other Codemasters, he wore stocky white battle-armour. When he discovered the Guildmaster intended to use Gnosis to unlock all Code Command Words and give the Guild ultimate power of the Net, Lens spoke out and was made an exile. He forewarned the Mainframers of the plot and led them in a failed strike against Gnosis; he is now partnered with Bob.

AndrAIa 
 (Pronounced like the name Andrea in Italian) A backup copy of a Game Sprite who met Enzo in an undersea-themed game. She fell in love with him at ""first sight."" The original AndrAIa piggy-backed her icon on Enzo's. This allowed the backup to escape the game and stay in Mainframe with Enzo, but the original remained in the game.

 Because of the nature of the game from which she was born, AndrAIa has many mermaid-like qualities: she wears fish-skin garments, wears starfish in her hair (which can be used like a shuriken with boomerang qualities), and utilizes such armaments as paralysis-inducing fingernails and a trident in combat. She also possesses a superior hearing ability. In her younger form, she was new to the ways of Systems, not used to anything but fighting Users. She also appeared highly naive, such as believing Enzo's lies about being a Guardian (though she later admitted she always knew the truth, but didn't care because of her feelings for him). Over time, she began adapting and learning how to operate, and knew to try to keep Enzo's confidence up during his early days as Guardian. During the period of her and Enzo's journey through the Games in search of Bob and a way back home, she matures into a statuesque beauty who continually tries to temper her lover's cynicism, and provides a more relaxed and diplomatic counterpart to Matrix, however has shown to become very lonely when separated from Matrix. It is also during this time when AndrAIa improved as a warrior and gained engineering skills.

 During their journey, she is more than often the voice of reason, and despite Matrix's jealousy, befriends the newcomer Ray Tracer whom assists them in entering the WEB. Before actually entering the dimension; however, AndrAIa is bitten by a Web creature that steals her energy as well as part of her code. Through the majority of the trip in the Web she remained in a comatose state while the others fought against the environment in search of Bob and the creature that bit her. Incidentally, Bob finds them and heals AndrAIa with the recovered code and energy.

 During Daemon Rising, AndrAIa saves Matrix from being transported to the Super Computer and is infected by Daemon. After Daemon's defeat, AndrAIa becomes a bridesmaid in Dot's wedding and is last seen with Mouse in the Principal Office catacombs during the beginning of Megabyte's Hunt.

 The AI in her name is capitalized, as her name is a reference to Artificial Intelligence. As an AI Game Sprite, she is designed to adapt to her surroundings and experiences; as a result, she is a more adjusted sprite than Matrix despite suffering the same traumas. She also gets on better with the new young Enzo than Matrix does, effectively being a second big sister (Dot is still his first). Also, andraia (Ανδρεια) is a Greek word meaning courageous.

 She also has a great fondness for motorcycles.

Gigabyte 
 Gigabyte (voiced by Blu Mankuma) Class-5 (energy absorbing), malignant, extremely powerful super-virus, he is the upgraded form of Killabyte. A signal from Welman Matrix's experimental gateway accidentally locked onto Gigabyte and brought him to Mainframe. The gateway overloaded and Mainframe's twin city was destroyed in the explosion, becoming the small ruin called Lost Angles. Gigabyte was separated into Megabyte and Hexadecimal, making the siblings effectively opposite parts of the same whole; Megabyte representing order and Hexadecimal representing chaos.

 Gigabyte was briefly reformed in Season 2 - his first appearance on the show - when Megabyte, possessed by a Web Creature, merged with Hexadecimal. Upon formation, he announced ""I am become Gigabyte, Destroyer Of Systems!"", a reference to the Bhagavad Gita. Luckily for Mainframe, Hexadecimal's power had been drained at the time and Gigabyte was not at full strength, forced to feed off the energy of individual Sprites. Mainframe was powered down to keep him from gaining power and the System's defenders, helped by the newly returned Mouse, attempted to keep him contained. He was finally beaten when Bob trapped him inside a Tear and used its energy to split Gigabyte once again.

 His name comes from the unit of computer memory, measuring approximately one billion bytes (1,024 megabytes).

Fax Modem and Data Nully 
 CGI special agents. They are one-binomes modelled on Fox Mulder and Dana Scully from the X-Files, and their names are references to the Fax Modem and Data Nully. Gillian Anderson, the actress who portrayed Dana Scully, also provided the voice for the character Data Nully. Modem believes there is no User and the Guardians drop Games on Systems to promote the User myth. They were called into Mainframe to investigate the rash of disappearances and helped battle the Web Creature behind them.

Turbo 
 Prime Guardian and leader of the Guardian Collective. He is equipped with a Guardian Keytool, Copland, which can transform into any device with a voice command. He speaks with a Texan accent.

 Turbo was forced to order the destruction of Mainframe after a Web Creature arrived in the system. Turbo regretted the decision due to his friendship with Bob and secretly increased the countdown on the bomb he had hidden with Mouse. Although Bob got rid of the bomb, Turbo was considered by many to be an enemy after that. When Matrix encounters Turbo in a distant system, he is searching for Bob, the only Guardian known to not be infected by Daemon. Turbo informs Matrix of the Daemon threat, as well as the necessity of finding Bob. As he could still fight the infection, Turbo promised to work against Daemon from inside the Guardian Collective. However, when next the two met, Turbo had succumbed completely to Daemon's infection. As a result of that, Copland (following Turbo's own orders) had left him. After being partially cured by Bob's incomplete Guardian code, Turbo provided valuable information which helped Mainframe fight back against the super-virus.

 After Daemon's defeat, Turbo returned to his position as Prime Guardian. He was later reunited with Copland when all of the keytools returned to free Glitch-Bob from his encasement. When a net-wide viral onslaught broke out in Code Of Honor, he became angry at Bob and his theories on reforming Viruses, blaming this idea (which was spreading in the Collective) for the viruses being able to attack tens of thousands of systems. He also has shown a disillusionment with the Guardian Collective and ideals, and secretly hired Matrix for an unknown purpose.

 His name is possibly a reference to turbo mode which increased the clock speed of some early Intel processors (ex. 8088 and 80286) for faster performance.

 Copland is possibly a reference to the unreleased Copland operating system created by Apple.

Class-M Webcreature 
 Not technically a virus, but attracted to them and later revealed to have been sent by Daemon. Its first act upon reaching Mainframe was to attack and bond with Hexadecimal (turning her into a creature resembling Spider-Man's enemy, Venom), causing the System's nulls to swarm over her in an attempt to keep the Webcreature from the rest of Mainframe. After Hexadecimal's powers were drained by the nulls, the creature escaped and bonded with Megabyte. In both cases, the resulting symbiote was highly animalistic and under the control of the Webcreature. It turned out the Webcreature, slowly growing from a spider-like blob into an immense fanged alien horror, needed to drain energy from others to remain stable outside of the Web - first it went for Hex and her transfinite energy reserves, then it had Megabyte merge with Hex to form the energy-absorbing Gigabyte, and finally it abducted scores of Sprites on Level 31 and slowly drained their energy in a larder. Its victims rescued and the CPUs keeping it cornered by direct torchlight (as it could not stand strong, bright lights), it finally escaped towards a Tear - as a Class M, it could turn Tears into Portals to the Web, and using that it escaped back to its home.

 A Class-M in a System with Net access is a dangerous threat, as it could lead to the Web being able to invade the entire Net. As a result, Guardian protocol is to completely destroy such a System in order to be sure of terminating the Webcreature and any others that might also be there.

 The term ""Class-M"" may be a joke reference to Star Trek's frequent use of the term ""Class-M"" planet.

Web Spores 
 An alien army that invaded Mainframe through the Class M's Web-Portal. They show a hive mentality and a sense of co-operative strategy, able to form traps for CPU attack craft. Their strategy is to send in Probes first, mostly unaggressive beings that inspect a System for potential threats, and then sending in the aggressive warrior Spores once they have worked out the layout. Their numbers are vast, capable of overrunning and crashing entire Systems, and only a CPU/ABC alliance was able to defeat them.

Season three characters

Powerlock 
 A large, overly muscled, gun-toting virus, modeled on action heroes and the gun-toting comic book anti-heroes of the early 90s (Most directly the Punisher, as indicated by the skull-like logo he wore on his chest). He was downloaded into an isolated System populated by energy beings called Spectrals. He was openly a member of the Hero Selective, the System's Sprite defenders against Games, and kept his viral nature hidden while he tried to cause System crashes. His true nature was discovered by Matrix and he was deleted. He had an unnamed partner, a Viral Spectral.

Ray Tracer (The Surfer) 
 A ""second generation"" Web search engine introduced in Season 3, he became a main character upon the return to Mainframe. He is unique in that as long as even a piece of his board exists, he will continue to live, as he and his board are the same entity. Though they may be separated, as long as one piece exists, it will regenerate and his body will as well. A side effect of this is that when he and his board are separated, any damage to his board is reflected on his person in the nature of the lights that circulate on his body shorting out. During Season 4 and beyond, he is romantically involved with Mouse. His icon resembles a Motorola logo, which is appropriate because Motorola helped to name his character (they also made a line of SURFR modems). He also speaks with a strong Australian accent.

 An adrenaline junkie, Ray longs for adventure and loves the danger of exploring the treacherous realm known as the Web. Captured by the Guardians for unauthorized Net travel, he is rescued by a reluctant Matrix. After saving AndrAIa from a fleet of CPUs, he joins the crew of the Saucy Mare in searching for Bob in the Web, acting as their guide. Matrix is, at first, angered by the Surfer's presence, due to his seeming attraction for AndrAIa, but grows to respect him after he risks his life to repair AndrAIa's damaged code.

 Ray was separated from the others when they neared the portal to Mainframe, but returned to Mainframe through the same portal Megabyte was sent through and remained to help the citizens evacuate into the Principal Office when the system was close to crashing. After the restart, during the war against Daemon, Turbo claimed to Mouse that Ray had been infected. After Daemon's defeat, Ray returned to Mainframe with the pre-season 3 Bob (unaware that he was Megabyte in disguise.) Through Season 4, Ray was featured on several brief occasions but had no speaking parts; in the Code of Honor webcomic, he has reappeared as a minor supporting character.
 
 His name is a reference to a computer graphics technique, ray tracing, and his nickname a reference to web surfing. The symbiotic link between him and his board are similar to that of the Marvel character Silver Surfer, with the ability to easily travel in conditions that are otherwise dangerous to other beings. Also, in the series Ray's board is actually called a ""baud"", which is also a measurement of the rate of a transmission.

Unspecified-class Webcreatures 
 These resemble Hammerhead sharks with a vertical head and no eyes. They have the ability to drain energy from sprites. They are born from ball-shaped eggs connected by vein-like tubes. Newborns have no armour and sleek skin. Older Webcreatures develop a carapace-like hide that can withstand a lot of punishment. Their teeth can also chew through many substances, including sprites and metal. Although one is never seen, they can grow to a gargantuan size, roughly the size of a ship. Its bones are used to cover the Captain's ship as an armature for the other carapace pieces.

Web Riders 
 These are sprites that have survived the web, but at a cost. They no longer require sustenance from energy foods but are deformed. Newer sprites keep their original appearance while older ones start resembling webcreatures; in the case of Bob after his exile by Megabyte, his hair changed into a wave-pattern, silver scales began to grow on his face, and his uniform began melting into his skin. One of the elder sprites only has one hand, a vaguely peg leg, and a face resembling the M-class Webcreature.  While these sprites do not speak normally like every other character, they do communicate through what appears to be dial-up modem clicks.  While not technically viruses, they have proven to be quite hostile in nature.

Season four characters

Daemon 
Voiced by Colombe Demers
A super-virus bent on infecting the entire Net, she succeeded in infecting the entire Guardian Collective, with the exception of only Bob and Matrix, and turned the Super Computer into her base of operations. She is religiously worshiped by those she infects, and known to them as ""The Word"" and addressed as ""My Lady"".

Daemon claims to strive for peace and unity in the Net and is different from other viruses in that she does not seem to believe that what she is doing is wrong, seeing herself as a messiah trying to ""save"" the Net. She speaks in a French accent and calls Mike the TV ""Michel"", and is depicted in the style of Joan of Arc, a petite female holy warrior.  She is a disconcerting villain because while what she is doing is insanely evil, her personality is actually quite gentle and benign (like referring to Mike the TV as ""little one"" and giggling). Despite her seeming benevolence, her infection turns people peaceful at the cost of their free will - to the point where they do not care if they die doing Daemon's will. Her possessed Guardians use lethal force countering any and all resistance. A Guardian hit squad was sent to retrieve Matrix (whom they mistook for Bob) while in presumably the early stages of her infection, and they were far more hard-edged than the infected Guardians in Season 4. Daemon is complicated in her feelings. She has an interest in the concept of love, taking time to observe it and stating that sprites are lucky because they can feel love when viruses cannot— or at least so she believes, given that Hexidecimal later violently opposes her almost purely based out of romantic love for Bob once she returns to her viral state. However she also has pride as a virus because when she found out that Hexidecimal was helping the sprites and had become sprite-like, she was enraged. In fact Hexidecimal is the only character in the entire series Daemon shows true animosity towards, calling her an abomination and a disgrace to her kind. This animosity disappeared when Hex returned to her true form: Daemon wondering why they were still fighting and stating that, as viruses, they should be friends. When her attempts to persuade Hex fail, she proves to be completely willing to continue their battle before her hourglass necklace empties its top half, sending her into the final stage of her attempted attack on the net.

In ""The Episode With No Name"", Turbo revealed Daemon to be the one who sent the Web creature to attack Mainframe in the first place (during Season 2's ""Nullzilla""). The reason for this is unknown, but as Season 2 also had a reference to the Web ""getting out of control and invading Systems"", it may have been a diversionary tactic to keep the Guardians looking elsewhere. (Better Scenario) Since Daemon's army of Guardians lost their Key-Tools after becoming fully infected, she had briefly lost her chance to fully infect the entire Net. Since Daemon had full access to the Super-Computer and its records, she eventually learned of KiloByte's upgrade to Class-5 Virus GigaByte (flash-back in Season 4, prequel to Season 1). Since GigaByte has many high level functions such as creating portals, it was necessary for Daemon to gain control GigaByte, unfortunately, soon after becoming GigaByte, he was pulled into a portal to MainFrame and was split in two, thus creating MegaByte and Hexadecimal. After learning of the split, Daemon sent the Web creature to force the merger of MegaByte and Hexadecimal to create GigaByte once more. But again, GigaByte's life was shortly lived as he was later split by Bob (Season 2).

Daemon's plot involves keeping Net travel available, forcing Systems to remain open by destroying their Port Control Towers so inhabitants cannot take their system off the Net. As infected Guardians lack Keytools, she needs to keep Systems on the Net to be able to infect them as her army cannot create Portals; this also keeps the Systems isolated from each other, as no one System can stand against the Super-Computer. Instead of infecting the Systems outright, she puts her infection in egg-shaped viral bombs which are then placed in System Cores. At a specific point in time, they detonate and the whole System is infected - 92% of the Net was infected as a result. Her plan was to infect the whole Net and then, at a specific point in time, she would die and release the Cron code that would cause everything on the Net to count down; when they reached zero, they would spontaneously delete. The Net would be unified in the peace of total oblivion.

Her name is a reference to services running on Unix systems in the background as well as the Greek word ""daemon"".  ""The Word"" may be a reference to a unit of memory called a word. In her final scene she reveals that The Word is ""Cron"" (""I am not an entity, I am a time. My time is now. The Word is Cron.""), and Bob realizes that she is a ""cron virus""-an ""end to all things"" virus (possibly just an entry in a Unix system's ""crontab"" file, which is used by the ""cron"" process to run jobs at preselected times, chronologically). It may also be a reference to Cronos, the personification of time in Greek mythology. The chant that Daemon makes her followers say is a binary countdown. The first to do this is Daecon who counts down his deletion at 5 (101 in binary). The full binary countdown is 1010011010 which is the binary representation of the number 666.

Daecon 
Daemon's main advisor and assistant, and under the influence of The Word. His name is probably a word play on a ""Deacon."" Not much else is known about him. His name and character follow Daemon's religious motif. He was deleted (and gave the viewer an early look into Daemon's eventual ""attack"") when he killed himself, due to failing Daemon's order to penetrate Mainframe.

Dixon Green 
 Bob's partner when he was in the Guardian Academy as a cadet. She was Glitch's original owner, and had a very flippant and single-minded personality. Her name is taken from the British TV show Dixon of Dock Green. Deleted due to damage inflicted by Killabyte, as Killabyte was being upgraded to Gigabyte.

Killabyte 

 A virus that had been captured and was waiting for deletion at the hands of Guardian Dixon Green. Moments before his demise, Killabyte received a user upgrade and escaped his bonds. Bob (then a cadet) attempted to subdue the upgraded Killabyte, but was unsuccessful and he lay unconscious as the virus drained Guardian Dixon Green. Killabyte would have killed Bob but was transformed into Gigabyte and then pulled from the Super Computer to Mainframe.

 His name comes from another unit of computer memory, measuring approximately one thousand bytes. However his name is officially spelled ""Killabyte"", even though the spelling for KB is ""Kilobyte"".

Welman Matrix 
 Scientific genius and father of Dot and Enzo Matrix. He designed a gateway device that would have allowed Mainframers to connect to outside Systems, sending a series of pings into the Net to locate and contact Systems and then link to them. Unfortunately, Welman's experiment backfired due to his gateway pinging Killabyte and warping him into Mainframe as Gigabyte. The resulting explosion nullified Welman, split Gigabyte into the entities Hexadecimal and Megabyte, and destroyed Mainframe's sister city, the ruins of which were later to be known as Lost Angles. As a null, he was adopted as Nibbles by Megabyte, who apparently knew his true identity as he once referred to him as ""Father.""

 In Season 4, Hexadecimal's powers over nulls allowed him to regain his sentient mind and mold with other nulls to form a body. While catching up with his family, the young Enzo was found to have adapted to his dad's transformation quite well (""Dad's a null monster now, it's so cool!.""), though Phong informed Welman of Matrix also being his son, there was no apparent interaction between the two during the series except for Matrix being glad his father had returned.

 Since Welman's ability to assert his personality is directly connected to Hexadecimal's well-being, she imbued young Enzo's icon with the same function before sacrificing herself to undo Daemon's Net-wide infection. When Enzo came in contact with him, Welman regained his sentient mind once more, and became able to move around by controlling a ""Null-Bot"", which he used to walk his daughter Dot down the aisle at her wedding. His robotic body is later infected by Megabyte at the end of season 4 and used to capture the young Enzo as everyone is forced to flee to the catacombs after Megabyte infiltrates the Principal Office. In Code Of Honor, he is initially enslaved to Megabyte and goes missing after the villain is destroyed.

 A flashback in Daemon Rising shows him rehearsing a lecture about his theories, in an homage to Daniel Jackson from the Stargate movie/series. In fact, his gateway command even looks like a Stargate.

3858,['[ end the to vitality and health abundant with Endowed ?'],"Thomas Jeeves Horder, 1st Baron Horder,  (7 January 1871 – 13 August 1955) was a British physician best known for his appointments as physician-in-ordinary to Kings Edward VII, Georges V and VI, and extra physician to Queen Elizabeth II. He was also the chosen physician of three prime ministers. He was knighted in 1918, made a baronet in 1923 and raised to the peerage in 1933.

Biography

Early life and education

Thomas Jeeves Horder was born on 7 January 1871, the son of draper Albert Horder, in Shaftesbury, Dorset. Jeeves was his mother's maiden name. He was educated privately, and at the University of London and St Bartholomew's Hospital, London.

Career
Horder began his career at St Bartholomew's Hospital, where his first junior post was under Samuel Gee. When still quite young, Horder successfully made a difficult diagnosis on King Edward VII which made his reputation. In 1908 he was appointed as the first physician to the Cancer Hospital, later known as the Royal Marsden Hospital.

His patients included every British monarch from Edward VII to Elizabeth II (except Edward VIII). They also included two prime ministers, Ramsay MacDonald and Bonar Law, and labour leader Hugh Gaitskell.

He was involved in many official committees including advising the Ministry of Food during World War II. After the war he opposed many of Aneurin Bevan's plans for a national health service and may have helped modify some of those less palatable to the medical profession.

He held the positions of Deputy Lieutenant County of Hampshire; Extra Physician to the Queen (formerly Extra Physician to King George VI); and Consulting Physician to St Bartholomew's Hospital (1912–1936). Knighted in 1918, he was created a Baronet in 1923. He was raised to the peerage as Baron Horder, of Ashford in the County of Southampton on 23 January 1933.

Horder served as president of the British Eugenics Society from 1935 to 1949. He was president of the Cremation Society of Great Britain from 1940 to his death in 1955.

Honored with the title of Mahakabi () in Nepali literature, he was known as a poet with a golden heart. He is considered to be the greatest and most famous literary figure in Nepal. Some of his popular works include the best-selling Muna Madan, along with Sulochana, Kunjini, Bhikhari, and Shakuntala.

Life

Early life 
Devkota was born on the night of Lakshmi Puja on 13 November 1909 (27 Kartik 1966 BS) to father Teel Madhav Devkota and mother Amar Rajya Lakshmi Devi in Dhobidhara, Kathmandu. His father was a Sanskrit scholar, so he attained his basic education under the custodianship of his father. He started his formal education at Durbar High School, where he studied both Sanskrit grammar and English. After finishing his matriculation exams from Patna at the age of 17, he pursued Bachelor of Arts along with Bachelor of Laws at Tri-Chandra College and graduated from Patna University as a private examinee. His desire to complete his master's degree was left incomplete due to his family's financial conditions.

Only after a decade from his graduation as a lawyer, he started working in Nepal Bhasaanuwad Parishad (Publication Censor Board), where he met famous playwright Balkrishna Sama. At the same time, he also worked as a lecturer at Tri-Chandra College and Padma Kanya College.

Family
Devkota's son, Padma Devkota, is also a poet and writer and served for many years as a professor at the English Department, Tribhuvan University, Kathmandu.

Health
In the late 1930s, Devkota suffered from nervous breakdowns, probably due to the deaths of his parents and his two-month old daughter. Eventually, in 1939, he was admitted to the Mental Asylum of Ranchi, India, for five months. With financial debts later in his life and being unable to finance the weddings and dowries of his daughters. He is once reported to have said to his wife, ""Tonight let's abandon the children to the care of society and youth and renounce this world at bedtime and take potassium cyanide or morphine or something like that [sic].""

Later years and death

Laxmi Prasad Devkota was a chain smoker throughout his life. After a long battle with cancer, Devkota died on 14 September 1959, at Pashupati Aryaghat, along the banks of Bagmati river in Pashupatinath Temple, Kathmandu. Prior to his death, Devkota's income was terminated by the Nepal Academy of Literature and Art because he attended the Afro-Asian Writers' Conference, which was held in modern-day Tashkent, without first seeking permission from them. He also spoke at the ceremony, praising well-known figures for their contributions to Nepali literature, including Bhanubhakta Acharya, Lekhnath Paudyal, Pandit Hemraj, and Somnath Sigdel. Devkota claimed in an interview that he hadn't received pay for the previous eight months and that as a result, he had been unable to purchase the medication he needed to treat his disease; moreover, he was struggling to even buy food. Devkota's personality was vibrant and assertive despite the fact that he was battling cancer, but his room was disorganized.

Learning and style
Devkota contributed to Nepali literature by starting a modern Nepali language romantic movement in the country. He was the second writer born in Nepal to begin writing epic poems in Nepali literature. Nepali poetry soared to new heights with Devkota's innovative use of the language.

Departing from the Sanskrit tradition that dominated the Nepali literary scene at the time, and being inspired from the Newar language ballad song Ji Waya La Lachhi Maduni, he wrote Muna Madan () (1930), a long narrative poem in a popular Jhyaure bhaka () folk tune. Muna Madan is undoubtedly the best-selling book in the history of Nepali literature. The 2003 film Muna Madan, which was Nepal's official entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 76th Academy Awards, was based on this poem. The work received immediate recognition from the Ranas—the country's rulers at the time. Muna Madan tells the story of Madan, a traveling merchant, who departs to Tibet in a bid to earn some money leaving behind his wife, Muna. The poem describes the thematic hardships of the journey: the grief of separation, the itching of longing, and the torment of death.

The ballad Ji Waya La Lachhi Maduni is a tragic song based on a Newa merchant, his mother, and his wife. The merchant is about to leave Kathmandu for Tibet on a work. The song starts with the wife pleading with her mother-in-law to stop him, saying that it's not even been a month since she came to their home and he wants to go away. Being raised in Kathmandu, Devkota had heard this song from locals singing it at a local Pati (). He was highly fascinated by the song and decided to re-write it in Nepali language. Since the Rana rulers had put a ban on the Newa trade, language and literature, he changed the main character from a Newa merchant as in the original song to a Kshatriya (warrior class) character. Although Kshatriya people did not practice trade for their living during those days, he had to depict it as such in order to lure the Rana rulers.

The following couplet, which is among the most famous and frequently quoted lines from the epic, celebrates the triumph of humanity and compassion over the hierarchies created by caste in Nepalese culture.

""क्षेत्रीको छोरो यो पाउ छुन्छ, घिनले छुँदैन
मानिस ठूलो दिलले हुन्छ जातले हुँदैन !""

The son of a Kshatriya touches your feet not with hatred but with love.
A man's greatness is determined by his heart; not by his caste or lineage.

Considered his magnum opus, Muna Madan has remained widely popular among the lay readers of Nepali literature; it remains the most popular Nepali book since 1936; the book was also translated into Mandarin; it was well received by China and considered successful.

Devkota, inspired by his five-month stay in a mental asylum in 1939, wrote a free-verse poem, Pagal (). The poem deals with his usual mental ability and is considered one of the best Nepali language poems.

""जरुर साथी म पागल !
यस्तै छ मेरो हाल ।
म शब्दलाई देख्दछु !
दृश्यलाई सुन्दछु !
बासनालाई संबाद लिन्छु ।
आकाशभन्दा पातालका कुरालाई छुन्छु ।
ती कुरा,
जसको अस्तित्व लोक मान्दैंन
जसको आकार संसार जान्दैन !""

Surely, my friend, I am mad,
That’s exactly what I am!
I see a word,
Hear sights,
Taste smells,
I touch things thinner than air,
Those things,
Whose existence the world denies,
Whose shapes the world does not know.

Devkota had the ability to compose long epics and poems with literary complexity and philosophical density in very short periods of time. He wrote Shakuntala, his first epic poem, and also the first Mahakavya () written in the Nepali language, in a mere three months. Published in 1945, Shakuntala is a voluminous work in 24 cantos based on Kālidāsa's famous Sanskrit play Abhijñānaśākuntalam. Shakuntala demonstrates Devkota's mastery of Sanskrit meter and diction, which he incorporated heavily while working primarily in Nepali. According to the late scholar and translator of Devkota, David Rubin, Shakuntala is among his greatest accomplishments. ""It is, without doubt, a remarkable work, a masterpiece of a particular kind, harmonizing various elements of a classical tradition with a modern point of view, a pastoral with a cosmic allegory, Kālidāsa's romantic comedy of earthly love with a symbolic structure that points to redemption through the coinciding of sensual and sacred love.""

Devkota also published several collections of short lyric poems set in various traditional and non-traditional forms and meters. Most of his poetry shows the influence of English Romantic poets like Wordsworth and Coleridge. The title poem in the collection Bhikhari () is reminiscent of Wordsworth's ""The Old Cumberland Beggar"". In this poem, Devkota describes the beggar going about his ways in dire poverty and desolation, deprived of human love and material comforts. On the other hand, the beggar is also seen as the source of compassion placed in the core of suffering and destitution. Devkota connects the beggar with the divine as the ultimate fount of kindness and empathy:

""कालो बादलबाट खसेको 
 अन्धकारमा भित्र पसेको,
 ईश्वर हो कि भिखारी ?
 बोल्दछ ईश्वर हृदय घुसेका 
 घर, घर आँगन चारी
 बोल्दछ, आर्तध्वनिमा बोल्दछ
 करूणामृत दिल भारी ।""

Fallen from the blackest clouds
To enter into darker shrouds,
Is he deity or beggar?
Buddha speaks – his words pierce the heart,
Wandering from house to house, yard to yard,
Now speaking with a voice of pain:
His heart in sorrow cowed.

Many of his poems focus on mundane elements of the human and the natural world. The titles of his poems like Ban (), Kisaan (), Baadal () shows that he sought his poetic inspiration in the commonplace and proximal aspects of the world. What resonates throughout most of his poetry is his profound faith in humanity. For instance, in the poem Ban, the speaker goes through a series of interrogations, rejecting all forms of comfort and solace that could be offered solely to him as an individual. Instead, he embraces his responsibility and concern for his fellow beings. The poem ends with the following quatrain that highlights the speaker's humanistic inclinations:

""दोस्त कहाँ छन्? साथ छ को को? घर हो तिम्रो कुन देश?
जान्छौ कुन पुर भवन मुसाफिर, ल्यायौ कुन सन्देश?
दोस्त मेरो शुभ उद्योगी, साथ छ साहस बेश ।
विश्व सबै घर, हृदय-पुरीतिर ल्याउछु सेवा सन्देश ।।""

Where are your friends? Who goes with you? Which land is your home?
What place do you seek, Traveller? With what news do you roam?
My friend is decent diligence. Courage comes with me.
The whole world is my home. To heartland I roam, with hues of humanity.

Besides poetry, Devkota also made significant contributions to the essay genre. He is considered the father of modern Nepali essay writing. He defied the conventional form of essays and broke the traditional rules of essay writing and embraced a more fluid and colloquial style which had more clarity in meaning, expressive in feelings, and eloquent in terms of language. His essays are generally satirical in tone and are characterized by their trenchant humour and ruthless criticism of the modernizing influences from the West on Nepali society. An essay titled Bhaladmi  () or criticizes a decadent trend in Nepali society to respect people based on their outward appearances and outfit rather than their actual inner worth and personality. In another essay titled Ke Nepal Sano Cha? (), he expresses deeply nationalistic sentiments inveighing against the colonial forces from British India which, he felt, were encroaching all aspects of Nepali culture. His essays are published in an essays book entitled Laxmi Nibhandha Sanghraha ().

Devkota also translated William Shakespeare's play Hamlet into Nepali. Moreover, he translated his own epic, Shakuntala, into English and wrote several poetry, essays, plays, and epics in English.

Politics

Laxmi Prasad Devkota was not active within any well-established political party, but his poetry consistently embodied an attitude of rebellion against the oppressive Rana dynasty. During his self-exile in Varanasi, he started working as an editor of Yugvani newspaper of the Nepali Congress, leading to the confiscation of all his property in Nepal by the Rana Government. After the introduction of democracy through Revolution of 1951, Devkota was appointed member of the Nepal Salahkar Samiti () in 1952 by King Tribhuvan. Later in 1957, he was appointed as Minister of Education and Autonomous Governance under the premiership of Kunwar Inderjit Singh.

4067,['Me Forgive Ever You Can film 2018 the In ?'],"Dorothy Parker (née Rothschild; August 22, 1893 – June 7, 1967) was an American poet, writer, critic, and satirist based in New York; she was best known for her wit, wisecracks, and eye for 20th-century urban foibles.

From a conflicted and unhappy childhood, Parker rose to acclaim, both for her literary works published in magazines, such as The New Yorker, and as a founding member of the Algonquin Round Table. Following the breakup of the circle, Parker traveled to Hollywood to pursue screenwriting. Her successes there, including two Academy Award nominations, were curtailed when her involvement in left-wing politics resulted in her being placed on the Hollywood blacklist.

Dismissive of her own talents, she deplored her reputation as a ""wisecracker."" Nevertheless, both her literary output and reputation for sharp wit have endured. Some of her works have been set to music; adaptations notably include the operatic song cycle Hate Songs by composer Marcus Paus.

Early life and education 
Also known as Dot or Dottie,  Parker was born Dorothy Rothschild in 1893 to Jacob Henry Rothschild and his wife Eliza Annie (née Marston) (1851–1898) at 732 Ocean Avenue in Long Branch, New Jersey. Her parents had a summer beach cottage there. Parker's mother was of Scottish descent. Her father was the son of Sampson Jacob Rothschild (1818–1899) and Mary Greissman (b. 1824), both Prussian-born Jews. Sampson Jacob Rothschild was a merchant who immigrated to the United States around 1846, settling in Monroe County, Alabama. Jacob Henry Rothschild was one of five known siblings. The others were Simon (1854–1908); Samuel (b. 1857); Hannah (1860–1911), later Mrs. William Henry Theobald; and Martin, born in Manhattan on December 12, 1865, who perished in the sinking of the Titanic in 1912. Parker wrote in her essay, ""My Home Town,"" that her parents returned to their Manhattan apartment shortly after Labor Day so that she could be called a true New Yorker. Her mother died in Manhattan in July 1898, a month before Parker's fifth birthday.

Her father remarried in 1900 to Eleanor Frances Lewis (1851–1903). Parker hated her father, who physically abused her, and her stepmother, whom she refused to call ""mother,"" ""stepmother,"" or ""Eleanor,"" instead referring to her as ""the housekeeper."" However, her biographer, Marion Meade, refers to this account as ""largely false,"" stating that the atmosphere in which Parker was growing up was indulgent, affectionate, supportive and generous. Parker grew up on the Upper West Side and attended a Roman Catholic elementary school at the Convent of the Blessed Sacrament on West 79th Street with her sister, Helen, although their father was Jewish and her stepmother was Protestant. (Mercedes de Acosta was a classmate.) Parker once joked that she was asked to leave following her characterization of the Immaculate Conception as ""spontaneous combustion."" Her stepmother died in 1903, when Parker was nine. Parker later attended Miss Dana's School, a finishing school in Morristown, New Jersey. She graduated from Miss Dana's School in 1911, at the age of 18, according to Authur, although Rhonda Pettit and Marion Meade state she never graduated from either school. Following her father's death in 1913, she played piano at a dancing school to earn a living while she worked on her poetry.

She sold her first poem to Vanity Fair magazine in 1914 and some months later was hired as an editorial assistant for Vogue, another Condé Nast magazine. She moved to Vanity Fair as a staff writer after two years at Vogue.

In 1917, she met a Wall Street stockbroker, Edwin Pond Parker II
(1893–1933) and they married before he left to serve in World War I with the U.S. Army 4th Division. Dorothy Parker filed for divorce in 1928. He later remarried, to Anne E. O’Brien, former probation officer of the Juvenile Court, and died at 39, following a dental procedure. It is disputed whether he died from an overdose of analgesic or sepsis resulting from multiple tooth extractions. Dorothy Parker retained her married name, though she remarried the screenwriter and former actor Alan Campbell, and moved to Hollywood.

Algonquin Round Table years 

Parker's career took off in 1918 while she was writing theater criticism for Vanity Fair, filling in for the vacationing P. G. Wodehouse. At the magazine, she met Robert Benchley, who became a close friend, and Robert E. Sherwood. The trio began lunching at the Algonquin Hotel on a near-daily basis and became founding members of what became known as the Algonquin Round Table. The Round Table numbered among its members the newspaper columnists Franklin Pierce Adams and Alexander Woollcott. Through their publication of Parker's lunchtime remarks and short verses, particularly in Adams' column ""The Conning Tower"", Dorothy began developing a national reputation as a wit. When the group was informed that famously taciturn former president Calvin Coolidge had died, Parker remarked, ""How could they tell?""

Parker's caustic wit as a critic initially proved popular, but she was eventually dismissed by Vanity Fair in 1920 after her criticisms too often offended powerful producers. In solidarity, Benchley resigned in protest. (Sherwood is sometimes reported to have done so as well, but in actuality he had been fired in December 1919.) She soon started working for Ainslee's Magazine, which had a higher circulation. She also published pieces in Vanity Fair, which was happier to publish her than employ her, The Smart Set, and The American Mercury, but also in the popular Ladies’ Home Journal, Saturday Evening Post, and Life.

When Harold Ross founded The New Yorker in 1925, Parker and Benchley were part of a board of editors established by Ross to allay the concerns of his investors. Parker's first piece for the magazine was published in its second issue. Parker became famous for her short, viciously humorous poems, many highlighting ludicrous aspects of her many (largely unsuccessful) romantic affairs and others wistfully considering the appeal of suicide.

The next 15 years were Parker's greatest period of productivity and success. In the 1920s alone she published some 300 poems and free verses in Vanity Fair, Vogue, ""The Conning Tower"" and The New Yorker as well as Life, McCall's and The New Republic.  Her poem, ""Song in a Minor Key"" was published during a candid interview with New York N.E.A. writer Josephine Van de Grift.

Parker published her first volume of poetry, Enough Rope, in 1926. The collection sold 47,000 copies and garnered impressive reviews. The Nation described her verse as ""caked with a salty humor, rough with splinters of disillusion, and tarred with a bright black authenticity."" Although some critics, notably The New York Times reviewer, dismissed her work as ""flapper verse,"" the volume helped affirm Parker's reputation for sparkling wit. Parker released two more volumes of verse, Sunset Gun (1928) and Death and Taxes (1931), along with the short story collections Laments for the Living (1930) and After Such Pleasures (1933). Not So Deep as a Well (1936) collected much of the material previously published in Rope, Gun, and Death and she re-released her fiction with a few new pieces in 1939 under the title Here Lies.

She collaborated with playwright Elmer Rice to create Close Harmony, which ran on Broadway in December 1924. The play was well received in out-of-town previews and was favorably reviewed in New York, but it closed after a run of only 24 performances. It became a successful touring production under the title The Lady Next Door.

Some of Parker's most popular work was published in The New Yorker in the form of acerbic book reviews under the byline ""Constant Reader"". Her response to the whimsy of A. A. Milne's The House at Pooh Corner was ""Tonstant Weader fwowed up."" Her reviews appeared semi-regularly from 1927 to 1933, were widely read, and were posthumously published in a collection under the name Constant Reader in 1970.

Her best-known short story, ""Big Blonde"", published in The Bookman magazine, was awarded the O. Henry Award as the best short story of 1929. Her short stories, though often witty, were also spare and incisive, and more bittersweet than comic; her style is often described as sardonic.

Parker eventually separated from her husband, divorcing in 1928. She had a number of affairs, her lovers including reporter-turned-playwright Charles MacArthur and the publisher Seward Collins. Her relationship with MacArthur resulted in a pregnancy. Parker is alleged to have said, ""how like me, to put all my eggs into one bastard.” She had an abortion, and fell into a depression that culminated in her first attempt at suicide.

Toward the end of this period, Parker began to become more politically aware and active. What would become a lifelong commitment to activism began in 1927, when she became concerned about the pending executions of Sacco and Vanzetti. Parker traveled to Boston to protest the proceedings. She and fellow Round Tabler Ruth Hale were arrested, and Parker eventually pleaded guilty to a charge of ""loitering and sauntering"", paying a $5 fine.

Hollywood 
In 1932, Parker met Alan Campbell, an actor with aspirations to become a screenwriter. They married two years later in Raton, New Mexico. Campbell's mixed parentage was the reverse of Parker's: he had a German-Jewish mother and a Scottish father. She learned that he was bisexual and later proclaimed in public that he was ""queer as a billy goat"". The pair moved to Hollywood and signed ten-week contracts with Paramount Pictures, with Campbell (who was also expected to act) earning $250 per week and Parker earning $1,000 per week. They would eventually earn $2,000 and in some instances upwards of $5,000 per week as freelancers for various studios. She and Campbell worked on more than 15 films.

In 1935, Parker contributed lyrics for the song ""I Wished on the Moon"", with music by Ralph Rainger. The song was introduced in The Big Broadcast of 1936 by Bing Crosby.

With Campbell and Robert Carson, she wrote the script for the 1937 film A Star Is Born, for which they were nominated for an Academy Award for Best Writing—Screenplay. She wrote additional dialogue for The Little Foxes in 1941. Together with Frank Cavett, she received a nomination for an Oscar for the screenplay of Smash-Up, the Story of a Woman (1947), starring Susan Hayward.

After the United States entered the Second World War, Parker and Alexander Woollcott collaborated to produce an anthology of her work as part of a series published by Viking Press for servicemen stationed overseas. With an introduction by W. Somerset Maugham, the volume compiled over two dozen of Parker's short stories, along with selected poems from Enough Rope, Sunset Gun, and Death and Taxes. It was published in the United States in 1944 under the title The Portable Dorothy Parker. Hers is one of three volumes in the Portable series, including volumes devoted to William Shakespeare and The Bible, that have remained in continuous print.

During the 1930s and 1940s, Parker became an increasingly vocal advocate of civil liberties and civil rights, and a frequent critic of authority figures. During the Great Depression, she was among numerous American intellectuals and artists who became involved in related social movements. She reported in 1937 on the Loyalist cause in Spain for the Communist magazine, 'The New Masses.' At the behest of Otto Katz, a covert Soviet Comintern agent and operative of German Communist Party agent Willi Münzenberg, Parker helped to found the Hollywood Anti-Nazi League in 1936, which the FBI suspected of being a Communist Party front. The Hollywood Anti-Nazi League's membership eventually grew to some 4,000 strong. According to David Caute, its often wealthy members were ""able to contribute as much to [Communist] Party funds as the whole American working class,"" although they may not have been intending to support the Party cause.

Parker also served as chair of the Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee's fundraising arm, ""Spanish Refugee Appeal"". She organized Project Rescue Ship to transport Loyalist veterans to Mexico, headed Spanish Children's Relief, and lent her name to many other left-wing causes and organizations. Her former Round Table friends saw less and less of her, and her relationship with Robert Benchley became particularly strained (although they would reconcile). Parker met S. J. Perelman at a party in 1932 and, despite a rocky start (Perelman called it ""a scarifying ordeal""), they remained friends for the next 35 years. They became neighbors when the Perelmans helped Parker and Campbell buy a run-down farm in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, near New Hope, a popular summer destination among many writers and artists from New York.

Parker was listed as a Communist by the publication Red Channels in 1950. The FBI compiled a 1,000-page dossier on her because of her suspected involvement in Communism during the era when Senator Joseph McCarthy was raising alarms about communists in government and Hollywood. As a result, movie studio bosses placed her on the Hollywood blacklist. Her final screenplay was The Fan, a 1949 adaptation of Oscar Wilde's Lady Windermere's Fan, directed by Otto Preminger.

Her marriage to Campbell was tempestuous, with tensions exacerbated by Parker's increasing alcohol consumption and Campbell's long-term affair with a married woman in Europe during World War II. They divorced in 1947, remarried in 1950, then separated in 1952 when Parker moved back to New York. From 1957 to 1962, she lived at the Volney Residential Hotel on Manhattan's Upper East Side and wrote book reviews for Esquire magazine. Her writing became increasingly erratic owing to her continued abuse of alcohol. She returned to Hollywood in 1961, reconciled with Campbell, and collaborated with him on a number of unproduced projects until Campbell died from a drug overdose in 1963.

Later life and death 
Following Campbell's death, Parker returned to New York City and the Volney Residential hotel. In her later years, she denigrated the Algonquin Round Table, although it had brought her such early notoriety:

Parker occasionally participated in radio programs, including Information Please (as a guest) and Author, Author (as a regular panelist). She wrote for the Columbia Workshop, and both Ilka Chase and Tallulah Bankhead used her material for radio monologues.

Parker died on June 7, 1967, of a heart attack at the age of 73. In her will, she bequeathed her estate to Martin Luther King Jr., and upon King's death, to the NAACP.

Burial

Following her cremation, Parker's ashes were unclaimed for several years. Finally, in 1973, the crematorium sent them to her lawyer's office; by then he had retired, and the ashes remained in his colleague Paul O'Dwyer's filing cabinet for approximately 17 years. In 1988, O'Dwyer brought this situation to public attention, with the aid of celebrity columnist Liz Smith; after some discussion, the NAACP claimed Parker's remains and designed a memorial garden for them outside its Baltimore headquarters. The plaque read,

In early 2020, the NAACP moved its headquarters to downtown Baltimore and the question about what would happen to Parker's ashes became the topic of much speculation, especially after the NAACP formally announced it would later move to Washington, D.C.

The NAACP restated that Parker's ashes will ultimately be where her family wishes her to be. ""It’s important to us that we do this right,” said the NAACP.

Relatives called for the ashes to be moved to the family's plot in Woodlawn Cemetery, in the Bronx, where a place had been reserved for Parker by her father. On August 18, 2020, Parker's urn was exhumed. ""Two executives from the N.A.A.C.P. spoke, and a rabbi who had attended her initial burial said Kaddish."" On August 22, 2020, Parker was re-buried privately in Woodlawn, with the possibility of a more public ceremony later. ""Her legacy means a lot,"" added representatives from the NAACP.

Honors

On August 22, 1992, the 99th anniversary of Parker's birth, the United States Postal Service issued a 29¢ U.S. commemorative postage stamp in the Literary Arts series. The Algonquin Round Table, as well as the number of other literary and theatrical greats who lodged at the hotel, contributed to the Algonquin Hotel's being designated in 1987 as a New York City Historic Landmark. In 1996, the hotel was designated as a National Literary Landmark by the Friends of Libraries USA, based on the contributions of Parker and other members of the Round Table. The organization's bronze plaque is attached to the front of the hotel. Parker's birthplace at the Jersey Shore was also designated a National Literary Landmark by Friends of Libraries USA in 2005 and a bronze plaque marks the former site of her family house.

In 2014, Parker was elected to the New Jersey Hall of Fame.

In popular culture 
Parker inspired a number of fictional characters in several plays of her day. These included ""Lily Malone"" in Philip Barry's Hotel Universe (1932), ""Mary Hilliard"" (played by Ruth Gordon) in George Oppenheimer's Here Today (1932), ""Paula Wharton"" in Gordon's 1944 play Over Twenty-one (directed by George S. Kaufman), and ""Julia Glenn"" in the Kaufman–Moss Hart collaboration Merrily We Roll Along (1934). Kaufman's representation of her in Merrily We Roll Along led Parker, once his Round Table compatriot, to despise him. She also was portrayed as ""Daisy Lester"" in Charles Brackett's 1934 novel Entirely Surrounded. She is mentioned in the original introductory lyrics in Cole Porter's song ""Just One of Those Things"" from the 1935 Broadway musical Jubilee, which have been retained in the standard interpretation of the song as part of the Great American Songbook.

Prince released ""The Ballad of Dorothy Parker"" in 1987; it was the first song recorded in his Chanhassen, Minnesota studio home.  Those closest to him at the time suggest the association between the poet and the waitress by the same name in the song is a coincidence, but Dorothy Parker died on Prince's 9th birthday and chances are this brought her to his attention prior to writing the song.

Parker is featured as a character in the novel The Dorothy Parker Murder Case by George Baxt (1984), in a series of Algonquin Round Table Mysteries by J. J. Murphy (2011– ), and in Ellen Meister's novel Farewell, Dorothy Parker (2013). She is the main character in ""Love For Miss Dottie"", a short story by Larry N Mayer, which was selected by writer Mary Gaitskill for the collection Best New American Voices 2009 (Harcourt).

She has been portrayed on film and television by Dolores Sutton in F. Scott Fitzgerald in Hollywood (1976), Rosemary Murphy in Julia (1977), Bebe Neuwirth in Dash and Lilly (1999), and Jennifer Jason Leigh in Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle (1994). Neuwirth was nominated for an Emmy Award for her performance, and Leigh received a number of awards and nominations, including a Golden Globe nomination.

The Wild Colonials song, ""Vicious Circle"" from Life As We Know It EP (2007) is about Dorothy Parker. The chorus lyrics are, ""I know how Dorothy Parker felt with someone in her way.""

Television creator Amy Sherman-Palladino named her production company 'Dorothy Parker Drank Here Productions' in tribute to Parker.

Tucson actress Lesley Abrams wrote and performed the one-woman show Dorothy Parker's Last Call in 2009 in Tucson, Arizona at the Winding Road Theater Ensemble. She reprised the role at the Live Theatre Workshop in Tucson in 2014. The play was selected to be part of the Capital Fringe Festival in DC in 2010.

In 2016, American actress Victoria Scott donned a Halloween costume of Parker in episode 5, season 8 of Modern Family.

In 2018, American drag queen Miz Cracker played Parker in the celebrity-impersonation game show episode of the Season 10 of Rupaul's Drag Race.

In the 2018 film Can You Ever Forgive Me? (based on the 2008 memoir of the same name), Melissa McCarthy plays Lee Israel, an author who for a time forged original letters in Dorothy Parker's name.

Adaptations
In the 2010s some of her poems from the early 20th century have been set to music by the composer Marcus Paus as the operatic song cycle Hate Songs for Mezzo-Soprano and Orchestra (2014); Paus's Hate Songs was included on Tora Augestad's and the Oslo Philharmonic's album Portraying Passion: Works by Weill/Paus/Ives (2018) with works by Paus, Kurt Weill and Charles Ives. It was described by musicologist Ralph P. Locke as ""one of the most engaging works"" in recent years; ""the cycle expresses Parker's favorite theme: how awful human beings are, especially the male of the species.""

In 2014, lyrics taken from her book of poetry Not So Deep as a Well were, with the authorization of the NAACP, used by Canadian singer Myriam Gendron to create a folk album of the same name. Also in 2014, Chicago jazz bassist/singer/composer Katie Ernst issued her album Little Words, consisting of her authorized settings of seven of Parker's poems.

In 2021 her book Men I'm Not Married To was adapted as an opera of the same name by composer Lisa DeSpain and librettist Rachel J. Peters. It premiered virtually as part of Operas in Place and Virtual Festival of New Operas commissioned by Baldwin Wallace Conservatory Voice Performance, Cleveland Opera Theater, and On Site Opera on February 18th, 2021.

4180,['tail the by tiger a control she Can ?'],"Marvel CyberComics or Webisodes were digital comics produced from 1996 to 2000 by Marvel Comics using Adobe Shockwave. The Marvel CyberComics were originally made available exclusively on the AOL web portal, but were later made freely available on the Marvel.com website. The Marvel CyberComics feature established Marvel characters such as Spider-Man and Wolverine and consist of a combination of comics and animation. The Marvel CyberComics were removed from the Marvel website in 2000, and the service was succeeded by Marvel Digital Comics Unlimited in 2007.

History
CyberComics were created by Marvel in the summer of 1996 as a part of a promotional deal with America Online. The CyberComics were placed into the AOL/Marvel Zone and were exclusively available to AOL users. In 1997 Marvel built their own website at MarvelOnline.com and the CyberComics were freely available to all users through registration on MarvelZone.com (due to the contract with AOL).

On September 17, 1999 NextPlanetOver.com (NPO), a now-defunct online comics store,  announced a one-year marketing and content licensing deal with Marvel Comics. Terms included a year of run-of-site advertising on Marvel.com. In addition, NextPlanetOver.com was sponsoring monthly CyberComics created exclusively for them by Marvel. NPO was bought out less than a year later and went bankrupt in 2000; the CyberComics were renamed into ""Webisodes"" and made available at Marvel.com for free without any registration.

The first characters to star in CyberComics were Spider-Man and Wolverine, soon followed by several others. The comics were not only canon to the mainstream but also tied in directly with Marvel's newsstand offerings. They came out on a monthly basis, in four parts consisting of eight pages each.

Using Macromedia's Shockwave software, readers guided the action by clicking through word balloons and following panels complete with animation, sound effects and music. CyberComics were still very much in the comic book or strip genre - the result was a cross between comics and animation.

The Cybercomics were made by taking penciled pages and transforming them through a program called ""Electric Image Painter"" and form-Z into the digital comics, colored in digitally in Adobe Illustrator.  Simple animations were created in Macromedia Shockwave, and Garry Schafer of grimmwerks created the soundscapes which drove the animations.  Done at a time previous to mp3 compression as common as it is now, only 4 channels of small, short soundscapes could be used at one time.

Due to financial reasons the production of new CyberComics ceased in 2000 and Marvel removed them from their website.

Having a huge back-issue archive, Marvel decided to save money by replacing Marvel CyberComics with Dotcomics. This successor would eventually become Marvel Unlimited.

Spider-Man

From 1996 till 1998 there was a run of the Spider-Man Cybercomics. They appeared monthly for 14 months in four eight-page, weekly installments/episodes. After the 52nd episode Marvel remade them officially into storylines:

Featuring appearances by Quasimodo, Vision, Captain America and Iron Man. ""Ride My Hard Drive, Baby!"" is written by Joe Kelly, with art by Casey Jones!

Mutants

 Gambit: The Hunt for the Tomorrow Stone (December 27, 1999) Was the first CyberComic referred to in a printed comic (in the pages of Gambit #12). The plot occurred approximately after Gambit #10 - Gambit helps Spat obtain the Tomorrow Stone to stop her de-aging and save her life. In his quest for it he encounters Sekhmet who needs the Stone herself to save her mother from the suspended animation she was put in by her husband. Sekhmet finally gets the Tomorrow Stone but provides it to Spat and saves her life. After that, Sekhmet goes on looking to find help for her mother (Assumedly, the Sekhmet story would have come up again in the Gambit comic, if it continued under Fabian Nicieza, but didn't since it was cancelled). Art by Daerick Gross.
 Wolverine: Merciless is the Mongrel by Tom DeFalco and Daerick Gross (In four parts; July 1996). This was one of the two first Marvel CyberComics ever (the other one was with Spider-Man). Pale Flower is playing a dangerous game, with Wolverine in the middle. Can she control a tiger by the tail? Features first appearances by Mongrel and Pale Flower.
 X-Men: Twisted History (In four parts; January 2000 ) Written by D. G. Chichester with art from Daerick Gross, the X-Men's original line-up gets a bit of a revamp, with Gambit, Rogue, and Colossus thrown into the mix! Read it here! 
 X-Men: The Ravages of Apocalypse (1996 one-shot) Was a promotional CyberComic story tied into the X-Men: The Ravages of Apocalypse videogame. The game itself was a commercial total conversion of the Quake engine. Written by Larry Hama, penciled by Daerick Gross.

Marvel's Excelsior Theatre
Scoop:
The only ""movie"" in this ""theatre"" was called ""The Secret Adventures of Captain America - Far Flung in the Far East"" and came out in five parts in 1999-2000. It was conceived by former editor and Stan-hattan Project founder James Felder and co-written by James Felder, Ben Raab and Joe Kelly with art/designs by John Cassaday and overseen by John Cerilli;  sound effects, music, animation and even the voice of Captain America was provided by Garry Schafer.  The idea was to do a Flash animated series with actors and writers contributing the characters' voices - all involved recorded parts - John Cerilli was Nick Fury, for example. Sort of a retro-modern version of the old movie serials with a bit of the Orson Welles's Mercury Theatre radio show vibe. It was discontinued after the fifth episode without bringing the story to an end for unclear reasons.

Story:
Chasing down a mysterious phenomenon in East Asia during the WWII, Cap confronts the nefarious Mandarin! A certain Sergeant Fury is present and accounted for as well, but with allies like these...

Other appearances include Dum Dum Dugan and Sgt. Fury's Howling Commandos, composed of Dino Manelli, Reb Ralston, Gabe Jones, Pinky Pinkerton and Izzey Cohen.

 Episode 1: Valley of Death
 Episode 2: In the Clutches of the Mandarin
 Episode 3: The Valley of Lost Spirits
 Episode 4: The Road of Frozen Hells
 Episode 5: Fireworks

Review:
The adventure featured numerous ""firsts"", including a new first meeting of Captain America and Nick Fury; one that is decidedly different than the one featured in the pages of Sgt Fury comic. Much more advanced than the CyberComics, it had music and actors performing their parts and more advanced animation. Oddly the story seemed to take the stand that Nick Fury was somehow opposed to Captain America beforehand, seeing him as some kind of glorified piece of propaganda.

4346,"['them find to able be they will on are lights the when , off are lights the when glow only balls The ?']","That Puppet Game Show is a British television series broadcast on BBC One between 10 August 2013 and 5 January 2014. The show was made by the BBC in conjunction with The Jim Henson Company and featured the Miskreant Puppets from Puppet Up! in their first family-related appearance. The show was hosted by a puppet character ""Dougie Colon"" and featured celebrities playing games alongside puppet characters. On 25 October 2013, it was announced that the show had been axed after the show had attracted largely negative press reviews and struggled in the ratings.

Format
Each week two celebrities go head to head in a number of games, hoping to win £10,000 for their chosen charity. They compete in subjects such as sport, science, celebrity, nature, music and mental agility. Each of the games is run and hosted by a different puppet character, who is an ""expert"" in their field.

In between each of the games, backstage scenes feature the experts and crew. There is also a family watching the game show on TV who make comments after each of the games are played.

Characters
Many of the puppet characters were recycled from characters in various other Henson productions.

 Dougie Colon (performed by Dave Chapman) – The puppet host of the BBC One comedy series ""That Puppet Game Show"" who also hosts ""The Puppet End Game"". In ""Staying Alive,"" it is revealed that Dougie doesn't think that Amber O'Neill is very smart. Dougie also bears a resemblance to Vernon Kay and even thinks so himself. Dougie rose to fame as a radio DJ on Bolton FM. He also worked as a warm-up act for Ant & Dec for a number of years before mainstream presenting on BBC One in 2013. Dougie's last name is pronounced ""cologne.""

Experts
The first series aired for seven episodes, each starring different celebrity guests.

 Dr. Heimlich Strabismus (performed by Brian Henson) – A scientist who is the science expert and  the host of ""Paddlestar Galactica"" and ""Blow By Blow"". Despite being a scientist, Dr. Strabismus has shown signs of being a little bit stupid. In ""Staying Alive,"" 5 things have been revealed about him and his family: He was born on 11 March, he thinks he is a Capricorn but he is really a Pisces, he cloned himself, he doesn't believe in horoscopes, and his mother was a German pretzel vendor. He is a recycled version of Dr. Scientist from Puppet Up!.
 The Amazing Ian (performed by Brian Henson) – An armadillo who is the mental agility expert and the host of ""Nosey Neighbor"" and ""Glow Balls"". The Amazing Ian is the only non-human expert in the show. It is ironic that he is the mental agility expert since he has been shown to be idiotic a lot. He is a recycled version of the armadillo puppet that was used for Dooley the Armadillo from Jim Henson's Animal Show, Annette the Armadillo from Bear in the Big Blue House, and Joe the Armadillo from Kermit's Swamp Years.
 Jemima Taptackle (performed by Louise Gold) – A sports expert who hosts ""Punch Your Lights Out"". In ""Manschool,"" it is revealed that Eddie considers Miss Taptackle to be the most masculine expert around despite her being female. She is a recycled and redressed version of the Cavewoman from Puppet Up!.
 Eddie Watts (performed by Dave Chapman) – A music expert who hosts ""Saucissong"" and ""Cheek to Cheek"". Eddie has been shown to be the smartest out of all the experts. In 'Jake's Dark Secret', it is revealed he is allergic to chocolate. He currently holds the record for being the male to present his games the most with 5 games. Eddie has a crush in Mancie O'Neill. He is a recycled version of a male Whatnot from The Wubbulous World of Dr. Seuss.
 Jake Hamilton-Jones (performed by Victor Yerrid) – A nature expert who hosts ""Dart Attack"" and ""Bird Droppings"". In multiple episodes, Jake and Eddie have been shown to be close friends. He is a recycled version of Mr. Guy from Puppet Up!.

She is a recycled version of a female greenish Whatnot from The Muppet Show.

Crew members
The following are the crew members that help to run this show:

 Mancie O'Neill (performed by Colleen Smith) – The television producer of That Puppet Game Show who is the older sister of Amber O'Neill. Mancie has a crush on Eddie Watts just like he does with her. She is a recycled version of the female curly-haired blue Whatnot from The Muppet Show.
 Udders McGhee (performed by Nigel Plaskitt) – A cow who is the Chairman of the Studio that is part of his own media empire. He has been best friends with each of the presidents of the United States, but couldn't stand George Bush. In ""Boss' Son,"" it is revealed that he has a son named Josh.
 Clyde Stravinsky (performed by Victor Yerrid) – A crab who is the scorekeeper. Clyde is married, but has developed a crush on Tess Daly. He is a recycled version of the red crab from Puppet Up!.
 The Hot Dogs – The Hot Dogs appear in different roles on the show like being in ""Saucissong"" and ""Nosey Neighbor"". They are recycled versions of Frankie Frank and the Footers from CityKids.

4448,['Problem or Answer -- Animation Computer included these of One ?'],"The Antics 2-D Animation software is a proprietary vector-based 2-D application for animators and graphic designers, running under Microsoft Windows. It was created in 1972 by Alan Kitching, the British animator, graphic designer, and software developer. From 1977 to 1998 the Antics software was continuously developed, and was widely used by many studios around the world. The software of that time ran under Unix and Fortran, which by the late 1990s had been superseded by newer multimedia-oriented systems based on C++, and support for the older Antics was discontinued in 1998. In 2006, a project to build a completely new Antics software for C++ and Windows was begun, and the first published version made available in 2010.

Antics in the 2010s
In the late 1990s, development of previous Antics versions under Unix and Fortran were discontinued. Some years later, many other animation software programs had appeared, but Kitching determined that very few were comparable to the original Antics principles, and so, in 2006, decided to embark on the project of building a new version of Antics 2-D for Windows. The first aim was to include all the previous functionality within the new Windows interactive design philosophy—for this it was named ""Antics Classic"". However, by nature, the new design itself totally transformed the older versions to a new level of flexibility and simplicity. This was further enhanced with additional functionality, such as digital video, and then became dubbed the ""Antics Classic++"".

The first version of ""Antics Classic++"" for Windows was launched for free-trial download in 2010, and further updates continued to complete it for the Summer 2011 Edition. Subsequently, Antics continues to be developed, with additional updates issued periodically, taking it to new functionality beyond the original Antics 'Classic' concepts.

However, the essential Antics principles have always remained the same, animation = drawings + movements, and are related to traditional animation techniques.

An Antics ""Scene"" can be made up of any number of ""Drawings"", consisting of any number of individual ""Cels"". Any mix of vector-based drawings and raster-based images can freely combined in any Cel or Drawing—including photo, scanned, and complete video sequences or other sequences. A wide range of tools is included for creating drawings, and in almost any style.

Animation is created with the ""Animation Chart"" which choreographs the action using any combination of effects (""FX"") and movements, including ""Camera FX"", ""Graphic FX"", ""Inbetween"", ""Skeleton"", ""Grid"", ""Colour FX"", and many others. Replay rendering can be at any resolution, and output in digital video format or to image files for cinema film recorder.

Up-to-date information on the full details and features can be found on Antics Workshop's website.

The Early History of Antics
In the early 1970s, Alan Kitching was mainly working on projects using traditional hand-drawn animation techniques, but he also wrote a number of articles for the BKSTS Journal (British Kinematograph, Sound and Television Society). One of these included Computer Animation -- Answer or Problem? in which he examined the possibilities offered to animators by emerging computer graphics techniques.

In 1972, Kitching met artist Colin Emmett, who was already experimenting with computer graphics at the Royal College of Art, using computers at Imperial College, London, and the Atlas Computer Laboratory near Oxford. At this point, Kitching had never thought of personally being involved in developing computer software, but when Emmett invited him to join him, Kitching took up the challenge. Before the year was out, he had the basics of a general-purpose animation system, which he named ""Antics"", and was completed early the next year.

Drawings traced on a computer drawing board came out on punched paper tape, and data for animation effects ('FX') were typed onto punched cards. Both were then fed into the Antics program, which produced the finished results on magnetic tape. Only at this point could the results be viewed, or recorded on 35mm film with the Atlas Lab's film plotter, which was black-and-white only. To achieve color results, Antics produced 3 separate black-and-white films, and used the Technicolor 3-film process to combine them as red, green and blue separations. Hence the name ""Antics"" was originally coined as an acronym for ""ANimated Technicolor-Image Computer System"".

The Antics system was first presented by Kitching at the BKSTS ""Film 73"" conference in London, and later again at the National Film Theatre. The presentation was then published in the BKST Journal of December 73, and in 1974 was awarded the Society's ""Denis Wratten"" award for technical achievement of the year. The Antics program was used to produce animation for many clients, including Finite Elements, a documentary made for the Atlas Lab itself in 1975.

In 1977, the national broadcaster Swedish TV (Sveriges Radio - 'SR') invited Kitching to develop a hands-on interactive version of Antics in Stockholm that would allow it to be used by even complete beginners without technical knowledge. This set-up used only a single monochrome screen and a drawing tablet, filmed direct off screen, and then variously coloured in the film processing. The project ran to 1979, culminating in production of a 5-minute cartoon short The Story of G, from a storyboard written by a group at the local art school. Antics full-colour results were later recorded using an experimental colour frame-store called BugStore, at the CADCentre in Cambridge.

Antics Through the 1980s and the 1990s

The Swedish Antics system was detailed in a major article by Kitching for the BKSTS Journal of August 1980, Antics -- From Stone-Age to Steam Age, which also described Kitching's vision for the future development of Antics towards full real-time interactivity.

In 1980, Japanese computer maker Nippon Univac Kaisha (NUK) set up a new Antics project with Kitching which ran between 1980 and 1982. This was the first machine suitable to run Antics as a dedicated stand-alone system, and included interactive full-colour and broadcast VTR recording. This became the first fully commercial configuration, and over a dozen systems were sold in Japan alone.

In 1985, suitable hardware was still very costly, but subsequent years saw prices gradually coming down as performance also steadily improved. From the DEC platforms of 1980 (Digital Equipment Corporation), then to Silicon Graphics in 1984, and then Apple Macintosh in 1989, Antics software supported all these platforms, and many new Antics studios sprang up in Europe, USA, and beyond.

Then, after the early '90s, Microsoft's Windows PC platform was starting to reach the performance needed for Antics, but with much lower hardware costs—and additionally it was also incorporating the kind of output and video devices required as standard, in particular for the emerging market of PC multimedia production.

To date, Antics software had all been implemented using the 'Fortran' language, and current platforms used the 'Unix' operating system. New integrated hardware, such as PC and Mac, required a new software design approach (""Event Driven""), which allowed relevant devices, like mouse and keyboard, to trigger input at any time—which made it much more natural for graphical use. The previous Antics approach was not compatible with this new design philosophy, and the Autumn 98 Edition was the last Unix/Fortran edition to be supported, as older platforms gradually became obsolete.

At this point, further development of Antics was discontinued, since the only option would be to write the entire software from scratch, using the 'C++' language—a task which might take several years—and which was not begun until 2006.

4470,['Decline in West Liberal the Is ?'],"Hans Kohn (, September 15, 1891 – March 16, 1971) was an American philosopher and historian. He pioneered the academic study of nationalism, and is considered an authority on the subject.

Life
Kohn was born into the German-speaking Jewish family in Prague, Bohemia, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. After graduating from a local German Gymnasium (high school) in 1909, he studied philosophy, political science and law at the German part of Charles-Ferdinand University in Prague.

Shortly after graduation, in late 1914 Kohn was called into the infantry of the Austro-Hungarian Army. Following training he was sent to the Eastern Front in the Carpathian Mountains, facing the Imperial Russian Army. He was captured in 1915 and taken by the Russians to a prison camp in Central Asia (in present-day Turkmenistan). During the civil war following the Bolshevik revolution, the pro-western Czechoslovak Legions came into Central Asia and he was set free. With them he traveled further east (called by Czechs the ""Siberian Anabasis""), until stopping at Irkutsk. The political situation then allowed him to return to Europe, arriving in 1920.

Kohn then lived in Paris, where he married Jetty Wahl in 1921.

The couple moved to London, where Kohn worked for Zionist organizations and wrote articles for newspapers. He moved to Palestine in 1925. From there he would frequently visit the United States. His writings began to generate books, where he discussed current geopolitics and nationalism. Eventually the couple immigrated to America in 1934.

They had one son, Immanuel Kohn.

Kohn was a prominent leader of Brit Shalom, which promoted a binational solution for promoting the co-existence of Jews and Arabs in the State of Israel.

Career
Kohn taught modern history at Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts. From 1948 to 1961, he taught at City College of New York. He also taught at the New School for Social Research, Harvard Summer School.

He wrote numerous books on nationalism, Pan-Slavism, German thought, and Judaism. He was an early contributor to the Foreign Policy Research Institute in Philadelphia.

In 1944, he published his major work, The Idea of Nationalism, on the dichotomy between western and eastern Nationalism. Kohn sought to understand the emergence of nationalism through the development of western civilization and the rise of liberalism. He also published a biography of Martin Buber. His autobiography, published in 1964, includes reflections on his times and his personal life.

He became widely popular in his lifetime and remained so after his death at the age of 39 in New York City. By then, he had acquired a reputation, which he had encouraged, as a ""roistering, drunken and doomed poet"".
 
Thomas was born in Swansea, Wales, in 1914. In 1931, when he was 16, Thomas, an undistinguished pupil, left school to become a reporter for the South Wales Daily Post. Many of his works appeared in print while he was still a teenager. In 1934, the publication of ""Light breaks where no sun shines"" caught the attention of the literary world. While living in London, Thomas met Caitlin Macnamara. They married in 1937 and had three children: Llewelyn, Aeronwy, and Colm.

Thomas came to be appreciated as a popular poet during his lifetime, though he found earning a living as a writer was difficult. He began augmenting his income with reading tours and radio broadcasts. His radio recordings for the BBC during the late 1940s brought him to the public's attention, and he was frequently used by the BBC as an accessible voice of the literary scene. Thomas first travelled to the United States in the 1950s. His readings there brought him a degree of fame, while his erratic behaviour and drinking worsened. His time in the United States cemented his legend, and he went on to record to vinyl such works as A Child's Christmas in Wales. During his fourth trip to New York in 1953, Thomas became gravely ill and fell into a coma. He died on 9 November 1953 and his body was returned to Wales. On 25 November 1953, he was interred at St Martin's churchyard in Laugharne, Carmarthenshire.

Although Thomas wrote exclusively in the English language, he has been acknowledged as one of the most important Welsh poets of the 20th century. He is noted for his original, rhythmic, and ingenious use of words and imagery. His position as one of the great modern poets has been much discussed, and he remains popular with the public.

Life and career

Early time

Dylan Thomas was born on 27 October 1914 in Swansea, the son of Florence Hannah (née Williams; 1882–1958), a seamstress, and David John Thomas (1876–1952), a teacher. His father had a first-class honours degree in English from University College, Aberystwyth, and ambitions to rise above his position teaching English literature at the local grammar school. Thomas had one sibling, Nancy Marles (1906–1953), who was eight years his senior. The children spoke only English, though their parents were bilingual in English and Welsh, and David Thomas gave Welsh lessons at home. Thomas's father chose the name Dylan, which could be translated as ""son of the sea"", after Dylan ail Don, a character in The Mabinogion. His middle name, Marlais, was given in honour of his great-uncle, William Thomas, a Unitarian minister and poet whose bardic name was Gwilym Marles. Dylan, pronounced ˈ [ˈdəlan] (Dull-an) in Welsh, caused his mother to worry that he might be teased as the ""dull one"". When he broadcast on Welsh BBC, early in his career, he was introduced using this pronunciation. Thomas favoured the Anglicised pronunciation and gave instructions that it should be Dillan .

The red-brick semi-detached house at 5 Cwmdonkin Drive (in the respectable area of the Uplands), in which Thomas was born and lived until he was 23, had been bought by his parents a few months before his birth. His childhood featured regular summer trips to the Llansteffan peninsula, a Welsh-speaking part of Carmarthenshire, where his maternal relatives were the sixth generation to farm there. In the land between Llangain and Llansteffan, his mother's family, the Williamses and their close relatives, worked a dozen farms with over a thousand acres between them. The memory of Fernhill, a dilapidated 15-acre farm rented by his maternal aunt, Ann Jones, and her husband, Jim, is evoked in the 1945 lyrical poem ""Fern Hill"", but is portrayed more accurately in his short story, The Peaches.

Thomas’ paternal grandparents, Anne and Evan Thomas, lived at The Poplars in Johnstown, just outside Carmarthen. Anne was the daughter of William Lewis, a gardener in the town. She had been born and brought up in Llangadog, as had her father, who is thought to be “Grandpa” in Thomas's short story, A Visit to Grandpa's, in which Grandpa expresses his determination to be buried, not in Llansteffan, but in Llangadog.

Evan worked on the railways and was known as Thomas the Guard. His family had originated in another part of Welsh-speaking Carmarthenshire, in the farms that lay around the villages of Brechfa, Abergorlech, Gwernogle and Llanybydder, and which the young Thomas occasionally visited with his father. His father's side of the family also provided the young Thomas with another kind of experience; most lived in the towns of the South Wales industrial belt, including Port Talbot, Pontarddulais and Cross Hands.

Thomas had bronchitis and asthma in childhood and struggled with these throughout his life. He was indulged by his mother, Florence, and enjoyed being mollycoddled, a trait he carried into adulthood, becoming skilful in gaining attention and sympathy. But Florence would have known that child deaths had been a recurring event in the family's history, and it's said that she herself had lost a child soon after her marriage.  But if Thomas was protected and spoilt at home, the real spoilers were his many aunts and older cousins, both those in Swansea and in the Llansteffan countryside.  Some of them played an important part in both his upbringing and later life, as Thomas’ wife, Caitlin, has observed: “He couldn't stand their company for more than five minutes...Yet Dylan couldn't break away from them, either. They were the background from which he had sprung, and he needed that background all his life, like a tree needs roots.”.

Thomas's formal education began at Mrs Hole's dame school, a private school on Mirador Crescent, a few streets away from his home. He described his experience there in Reminiscences of Childhood:
Never was there such a dame school as ours, so firm and kind and smelling of galoshes, with the sweet and fumbled music of the piano lessons drifting down from upstairs to the lonely schoolroom, where only the sometimes tearful wicked sat over undone sums, or to repent a little crime – the pulling of a girl's hair during geography, the sly shin kick under the table during English literature.

Alongside dame school, Thomas also took private lessons from Gwen James, an elocution teacher who had studied at drama school in London, winning several major prizes. She also taught  “Dramatic Art” and “Voice Production”, and would often help cast members of the Swansea Little Theatre (see below) with the parts they were playing. Thomas's parents’ storytelling and dramatic talents, as well as their theatre-going interests, could also have contributed to the young Thomas’ interest in performance.

In October 1925, Thomas enrolled at Swansea Grammar School for boys, in Mount Pleasant, where his father taught English. He was an undistinguished pupil who shied away from school, preferring reading and drama activities. In his first year one of his poems was published in the school's magazine, and before he left he became its editor. During his final school years he began writing poetry in notebooks; the first poem, dated 27 April (1930), is entitled ""Osiris, come to Isis"". In June 1928, Thomas won the school's mile race, held at St. Helen's Ground; he carried a newspaper photograph of his victory with him until his death.

In 1931, when he was 16, Thomas left school to become a reporter for the South Wales Daily Post, where he remained for some 18 months. After leaving the newspaper, Thomas continued to work as a freelance journalist for several years, during which time he remained at Cwmdonkin Drive and continued to add to his notebooks, amassing 200 poems in four books between 1930 and 1934. Of the 90 poems he published, half were written during these years.

The stage was also an important part of Thomas’ life from 1929 to 1934, as an actor, writer, producer and set painter. He took part in productions at Swansea Grammar School, and with the YMCA Junior Players and the Little Theatre, which was based in the Mumbles. It was also a touring company that took part in drama competitions and festivals around South Wales. Between October 1933 and March 1934, for example, Thomas and his fellow actors took part in five productions at the Mumbles theatre, as well as nine touring performances. Thomas continued with acting and production throughout his life, including his time in Laugharne, South Leigh and London (in the theatre and on radio), as well as taking part in nine stage readings of Under Milk Wood. The Shakespearian actor, John Laurie, who had worked with Thomas on both the stage  and radio thought that Thomas would “have loved to have been an actor” and, had he chosen to do so, would have been “Our first real poet-dramatist since Shakespeare.”

Painting the sets at the Little Theatre was just one aspect of the young Thomas’ interest in art. His own drawings and paintings hung in his bedroom in Cwmdonkin Drive, and his early letters reveal a broader interest in art and art theory. Thomas saw writing a poem as an act of construction “as a sculptor works at stone,”  later advising a student “to treat words as a craftsman does his wood or stone...hew, carve, mould, coil, polish and plane them...”  Throughout his life, his friends included artists, both in Swansea  and in London, as well as in America.

In his free time, Thomas visited the cinema in Uplands, took walks along Swansea Bay, and frequented Swansea's pubs, especially the Antelope and the Mermaid Hotels in Mumbles. In the Kardomah Café, close to the newspaper office in Castle Street, he met his creative contemporaries, including his friend the poet Vernon Watkins. The group of writers, musicians and artists became known as ""The Kardomah Gang"". This was also the period of his friendship with Bert Trick, a local shopkeeper, left-wing political activist and would-be poet, and with the Rev. Leon Atkin, a Swansea minister, human rights activist and local politician.

In 1933, Thomas visited London for probably the first time.

London and marriage, 1933–1939
Thomas was a teenager when many of the poems for which he became famous were published: ""And death shall have no dominion"", ""Before I Knocked"" and ""The Force That Through the Green Fuse Drives the Flower"". ""And death shall have no dominion"" appeared in the New English Weekly in May 1933. When ""Light breaks where no sun shines"" appeared in The Listener in 1934, it caught the attention of three senior figures in literary London, T. S. Eliot, Geoffrey Grigson and Stephen Spender. They contacted Thomas and his first poetry volume, 18 Poems, was published in December 1934. 18 Poems was noted for its visionary qualities which led to critic Desmond Hawkins writing that the work was ""the sort of bomb that bursts no more than once in three years"". The volume was critically acclaimed and won a contest run by the Sunday Referee, netting him new admirers from the London poetry world, including Edith Sitwell and Edwin Muir. The anthology was published by Fortune Press, in part a vanity publisher that did not pay its writers and expected them to buy a certain number of copies themselves.  A similar arrangement was used by other new authors including Philip Larkin. In September 1935, Thomas met Vernon Watkins, thus beginning a lifelong friendship. Thomas introduced Watkins, working at Lloyds Bank at the time, to his friends, now known as The Kardomah Gang. In those days, Thomas used to frequent the cinema on Mondays with Tom Warner who, like Watkins, had recently suffered a nervous breakdown. After these trips, Warner would bring Thomas back for supper with his aunt. On one occasion, when she served him a boiled egg, she had to cut its top off for him, as Thomas did not know how to do this. This was because his mother had done it for him all his life, an example of her coddling him. Years later, his wife Caitlin would still have to prepare his eggs for him.

In December 1935, Thomas contributed the poem ""The Hand That Signed the Paper"" to Issue 18 of the bi-monthly New Verse. In 1936, his next collection Twenty-five Poems, published by J. M. Dent, also received much critical praise. Two years later, in 1938, Thomas won the Oscar Blumenthal Prize for Poetry; it was also the year in which New Directions offered to be his publisher in the United States. In all, he wrote half his poems while living at Cwmdonkin Drive before moving to London. It was the time that Thomas's reputation for heavy drinking developed.

In early 1936, Thomas met Caitlin Macnamara (1913–94), a 22-year-old blonde-haired, blue-eyed dancer of Irish and French descent. She had run away from home, intent on making a career in dance, and aged 18 joined the chorus line at the London Palladium. Introduced by Augustus John, Caitlin's lover, they met in The Wheatsheaf pub on Rathbone Place in London's West End. Laying his head in her lap, a drunken Thomas proposed. Thomas liked to comment that he and Caitlin were in bed together ten minutes after they first met. Although Caitlin initially continued her relationship with John, she and Thomas began a correspondence, and in the second half of 1936 were courting. They married at the register office in Penzance, Cornwall, on 11 July 1937. In early 1938, they moved to Wales, renting a cottage in the village of Laugharne, Carmarthenshire. Their first child, Llewelyn Edouard, was born on 30 January 1939.

By the late 1930s, Thomas was embraced as the ""poetic herald"" for a group of English poets, the New Apocalyptics. Thomas refused to align himself with them and declined to sign their manifesto. He later stated that he believed they were ""intellectual muckpots leaning on a theory"". Despite this, many of the group, including Henry Treece, modelled their work on Thomas'.

During the politically charged atmosphere of the 1930s, Thomas's sympathies were very much with the radical left, to the point of holding close links with the communists, as well as decidedly pacifist and anti-fascist. He was a supporter of the left-wing No More War Movement and boasted about participating in demonstrations against the British Union of Fascists.

Wartime, 1939–1945
In 1939, a collection of 16 poems and seven of the 20 short stories published by Thomas in magazines since 1934, appeared as  The Map of Love. Ten stories in his next book, Portrait of the Artist as a Young Dog (1940), were based less on lavish fantasy than those in The Map of Love and more on real-life romances featuring himself in Wales. Sales of both books were poor, resulting in Thomas living on meagre fees from writing and reviewing. At this time he borrowed heavily from friends and acquaintances. Hounded by creditors, Thomas and his family left Laugharne in July 1940 and moved to the home of critic John Davenport in Marshfield, Gloucestershire. There Thomas collaborated with Davenport on the satire The Death of the King's Canary, though due to fears of libel the work was not published until 1976.

At the outset of the Second World War, Thomas was worried about conscription, and referred to his ailment as ""an unreliable lung"". Coughing sometimes confined him to bed, and he had a history of bringing up blood and mucus. After initially seeking employment in a reserved occupation, he managed to be classified Grade III, which meant that he would be among the last to be called up for service. Saddened to see his friends going on active service, he continued drinking and struggled to support his family. He wrote begging letters to random literary figures asking for support, a plan he hoped would provide a long-term regular income. Thomas supplemented his income by writing scripts for the BBC, which not only gave him additional earnings but also provided evidence that he was engaged in essential war work.

In February 1941, Swansea was bombed by the Luftwaffe in a ""three nights' blitz"". Castle Street was one of many streets that suffered badly; rows of shops, including the Kardomah Café, were destroyed. Thomas walked through the bombed-out shell of the town centre with his friend Bert Trick. Upset at the sight, he concluded: ""Our Swansea is dead"". Soon after the bombing raids, he wrote a radio play, Return Journey Home, which described the café as being ""razed to the snow"". The play was first broadcast on 15 June 1947. The Kardomah Café reopened on Portland Street after the war.

In five film projects, between 1942 and 1945, the Ministry of Information (MOI) commissioned Thomas to script a series of documentaries about both urban planning and wartime patriotism, all in partnership with director John Eldridge: Wales: Green Mountain, Black Mountain, New Towns for Old, Fuel for Battle, Our Country and A City Reborn.

In May 1941, Thomas and Caitlin left their son with his grandmother at Blashford and moved to London. Thomas hoped to find employment in the film industry and wrote to the director of the films division of the Ministry of Information. After being rebuffed, he found work with Strand Films, providing him with his first regular income since the Daily Post. Strand produced films for the MOI; Thomas scripted at least five films in 1942, This Is Colour (a history of the British dyeing industry) and New Towns For Old (on post-war reconstruction). These Are The Men (1943) was a more ambitious piece in which Thomas's verse accompanies Leni Riefenstahl's footage of an early Nuremberg Rally. Conquest of a Germ (1944) explored the use of early antibiotics in the fight against pneumonia and tuberculosis. Our Country (1945) was a romantic tour of Britain set to Thomas's poetry.

In early 1943, Thomas began a relationship with Pamela Glendower; one of several affairs he had during his marriage. The affairs either ran out of steam or were halted after Caitlin discovered his infidelity. In March 1943, Caitlin gave birth to a daughter, Aeronwy, in London. They lived in a run-down studio in Chelsea, made up of a single large room with a curtain to separate the kitchen.

The Thomas family also made several escapes back to Wales. Between 1941 and 1943, they lived intermittently in Plas Gelli, Talsarn, in Cardiganshire. Plas Gelli sits close by the River Aeron, after whom Aeronwy is thought to have been named. Some of Thomas’ letters from Gelli can be found in his Collected Letters. The Thomases shared the mansion with his childhood friends from Swansea, Vera and Evelyn Phillips. Vera's friendship with the Thomases in nearby New Quay is portrayed in the 2008 film, The Edge of Love.

In July 1944, with the threat in London of German flying bombs, Thomas moved to the family cottage at Blaencwm near Llangain, Carmarthenshire, where he resumed writing poetry, completing ""Holy Spring"" and ""Vision and Prayer"".

In September that year, the Thomas family moved to New Quay in Cardiganshire (Ceredigion), where they rented Majoda, a wood and asbestos bungalow on the cliffs overlooking Cardigan Bay. It was there that Thomas wrote the radio piece Quite Early One Morning, a sketch for his later work, Under Milk Wood. Of the poetry written at this time, of note is ""Fern Hill"", believed to have been started while living in New Quay, but completed at Blaencwm in mid-1945. His nine months in New Quay, said first biographer, Constantine FitzGibbon, were ""a second flowering, a period of fertility that recalls the earliest days…[with a] great outpouring of poems"", as well as a good deal of other material.  His second biographer, Paul Ferris, concurred: ""On the grounds of output, the bungalow deserves a plaque of its own."" The Dylan Thomas scholar, Walford Davies, has noted that New Quay ""was crucial in supplementing the gallery of characters Thomas had to hand for writing Under Milk Wood.""

Broadcasting years, 1945–1949

Although Thomas had previously written for the BBC, it was a minor and intermittent source of income. In 1943, he wrote and recorded a 15-minute talk titled ""Reminiscences of Childhood"" for the Welsh BBC. In December 1944, he recorded Quite Early One Morning (produced by Aneirin Talfan Davies, again for the Welsh BBC) but when Davies offered it for national broadcast BBC London turned it down. On 31 August 1945, the BBC Home Service broadcast Quite Early One Morning and, in the three years beginning in October 1945, Thomas made over a hundred broadcasts for the corporation. Thomas was employed not only for his poetry readings, but for discussions and critiques.

In the second half of 1945, Thomas began reading for the BBC Radio programme, Book of Verse, broadcast weekly to the Far East. This provided Thomas with a regular income and brought him into contact with Louis MacNeice, a congenial drinking companion whose advice Thomas cherished. On 29 September 1946, the BBC began transmitting the Third Programme, a high-culture network which provided opportunities for Thomas. He appeared in the play Comus for the Third Programme, the day after the network launched, and his rich, sonorous voice led to character parts, including the lead in Aeschylus's Agamemnon and Satan in an adaptation of Paradise Lost. Thomas remained a popular guest on radio talk shows for the BBC, who regarded him as ""useful should a younger generation poet be needed"". He had an uneasy relationship with BBC management and a staff job was never an option, with drinking cited as the problem. Despite this, Thomas became a familiar radio voice and within Britain was ""in every sense a celebrity"".

By late September 1945, the Thomases had left Wales and were living with various friends in London. In December, they moved to Oxford to live in a summerhouse on the banks of the Cherwell. It belonged to the historian, A.J.P. Taylor. His wife, Margaret, would prove to be Thomas’ most committed patron.

The publication of Deaths and Entrances in February 1946 was a major turning point for Thomas. Poet and critic Walter J. Turner commented in The Spectator, ""This book alone, in my opinion, ranks him as a major poet"".

The following year, in April 1947, the Thomases travelled to Italy, after Thomas had been awarded a Society of Authors scholarship. They stayed first in villas near Rapallo and then Florence, before moving to a hotel in Rio Marina on the island of Elba. On their return, Thomas and family moved, in September 1947, into the Manor House in South Leigh, just west of Oxford, found for him by Margaret Taylor. He continued with his work for the BBC, completed a number of film scripts and worked further on his ideas for Under Milk Wood,  including a discussion in late 1947 of The Village of the Mad (as the play was then called) with the BBC producer Philip Burton. He later recalled that, during the meeting, Thomas had discussed his ideas for having a blind narrator, an organist who played for a dog and two lovers who wrote to each other every day but never met. 

In March 1949 Thomas travelled to Prague. He had been invited by the Czech government to attend the inauguration of the Czechoslovak Writers' Union. Jiřina Hauková, who had previously published translations of some of Thomas's poems, was his guide and interpreter. In her memoir, Hauková recalls that at a party in Prague, Thomas ""narrated the first version of his radio play Under Milk Wood."" She describes how he outlined the plot about a town that was declared insane, mentioning the organist who played for sheep and goats and the baker with two wives.

A month later, in May 1949, Thomas and his family moved to his final home, the Boat House at Laugharne, purchased for him at a cost of £2,500 in April 1949 by Margaret Taylor. Thomas acquired a garage a hundred yards from the house on a cliff ledge which he turned into his writing shed, and where he wrote several of his most acclaimed poems. He also rented ""Pelican House"" opposite his regular drinking den, Brown's Hotel, for his parents who lived there from 1949 until 1953. 

Caitlin gave birth to their third child, a boy named Colm Garan Hart, on 25 July 1949. 

In October, the New Zealand poet, Allen Curnow, came to visit Thomas at the Boat House, who took him to his writing shed and ""fished out a draft to show me of the unfinished Under Milk Wood"" that was, says Curnow, titled The Town That Was Mad.

American tours, 1950–1953
American poet John Brinnin invited Thomas to New York, where in 1950 they embarked on a lucrative three-month tour of arts centres and campuses. The tour, which began in front of an audience of a thousand at the Kaufmann Auditorium of the Poetry Centre in New York, took in about 40 venues. During the tour, Thomas was invited to many parties and functions and on several occasions became drunk – going out of his way to shock people – and was a difficult guest. Thomas drank before some of his readings, though it is argued he may have pretended to be more affected by it than he actually was. The writer Elizabeth Hardwick recalled how intoxicating a performer he was and how the tension would build before a performance: ""Would he arrive only to break down on the stage? Would some dismaying scene take place at the faculty party? Would he be offensive, violent, obscene?"" Caitlin said in her memoir, ""Nobody ever needed encouragement less, and he was drowned in it.""

On returning to Britain, Thomas began work on two further poems, ""In the white giant's thigh"", which he read on the Third Programme in September 1950, and the incomplete ""In country heaven"". In October, Thomas sent a draft of the first 39 pages of 'The Town That Was Mad' to the BBC. The task of seeing this work through to production was assigned to the BBC's Douglas Cleverdon, who had been responsible for casting Thomas in 'Paradise Lost'. Despite Cleverdon's urgings, the script slipped from Thomas's priorities and in early 1951 he took a trip to Iran to work on a film for the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. The film was never made, with Thomas returning to Wales in February, though his time there allowed him to provide a few minutes of material for a BBC documentary, 'Persian Oil'. Early that year, Thomas wrote two poems, which Thomas's principal biographer, Paul Ferris, describes as ""unusually blunt""; the ribald ""Lament"" and an ode, in the form of a villanelle, to his dying father ""Do not go gentle into that good night"".

Despite a range of wealthy patrons, including Margaret Taylor, Princess Marguerite Caetani and Marged Howard-Stepney, Thomas was still in financial difficulty, and he wrote several begging letters to notable literary figures including the likes of T. S. Eliot. Taylor was not keen on Thomas taking another trip to the United States, and thought that if he had a permanent address in London he would be able to gain steady work there. She bought a property, 54 Delancey Street, in Camden Town, and in late 1951 Thomas and Caitlin lived in the basement flat. Thomas would describe the flat as his ""London house of horror"" and did not return there after his 1952 tour of America.

Thomas undertook a second tour of the United States in 1952, this time with Caitlin – after she had discovered he had been unfaithful on his earlier trip. They drank heavily, and Thomas began to suffer with gout and lung problems. The second tour was the most intensive of the four, taking in 46 engagements. The trip also resulted in Thomas recording his first poetry to vinyl, which Caedmon Records released in America later that year. One of his works recorded during this time, A Child's Christmas in Wales, became his most popular prose work in America. The original 1952 recording of A Child's Christmas in Wales was a 2008 selection for the United States National Recording Registry, stating that it is ""credited with launching the audiobook industry in the United States"".

In April 1953, Thomas returned alone for a third tour of America. He performed a ""work in progress"" version of Under Milk Wood, solo, for the first time at Harvard University on 3 May. A week later, the work was performed with a full cast at the Poetry Centre in New York. He met the deadline only after being locked in a room by Brinnin's assistant, Liz Reitell, and was still editing the script on the afternoon of the performance; its last lines were handed to the actors as they put on their makeup.

During this penultimate tour, Thomas met the composer Igor Stravinsky who had become an admirer after having been introduced to his poetry by W. H. Auden. They had discussions about collaborating on a ""musical theatrical work"" for which Thomas would provide the libretto on the theme of ""the rediscovery of love and language in what might be left after the world after the bomb."" The shock of Thomas's death later in the year moved Stravinsky to compose his In Memoriam Dylan Thomas for tenor, string quartet and four trombones. The  first performance in Los Angeles in 1954 was introduced with a tribute to Thomas from Aldous Huxley.

Thomas spent the last nine or ten days of his third tour in New York mostly in the company of Reitell, with whom he had an affair. During this time, Thomas fractured his arm falling down a flight of stairs when drunk. Reitell's doctor, Milton Feltenstein, put his arm in plaster and treated him for gout and gastritis.

After returning home, Thomas worked on Under Milk Wood in Wales before sending the original manuscript to Douglas Cleverdon on 15 October 1953. It was copied and returned to Thomas, who lost it in a pub in London and required a duplicate to take to America. Thomas flew to the States on 19 October 1953 for what would be his final tour. He died in New York before the BBC could record Under Milk Wood. Richard Burton starred in the first broadcast in 1954, and was joined by Elizabeth Taylor in a subsequent film. In 1954, the play won the Prix Italia for literary or dramatic programmes.

On 10 November 1952 Thomas's last collection Collected Poems, 1934–1952, was published; he was 38. It won the Foyle poetry prize. Reviewing the volume, critic Philip Toynbee declared that ""Thomas is the greatest living poet in the English language"". Thomas's father died from pneumonia just before Christmas 1952. In the first few months of 1953, his sister died from liver cancer, one of his patrons took an overdose of sleeping pills, three friends died at an early age and Caitlin had an abortion.

Death

Thomas left Laugharne on 9 October 1953 on the first leg of his trip to America. He called on his mother, Florence, to say goodbye: ""He always felt that he had to get out from this country because of his chest being so bad."" Thomas had suffered from chest problems for most of his life, though they began in earnest soon after he moved in May 1949 to the Boat House at Laugharne – the ""bronchial heronry"", as he called it. Within weeks of moving in, he visited a local doctor, who prescribed medicine for both his chest and throat.

Whilst waiting in London before his flight in October 1953, Thomas stayed with the comedian Harry Locke and worked on Under Milk Wood. Locke noted that Thomas was having trouble with his chest, ""terrible"" coughing fits that made him go purple in the face. He was also using an inhaler to help his breathing. There were reports, too, that Thomas was also having blackouts. His visit to the BBC producer Philip Burton, a few days before he left for New York, was interrupted by a blackout. On his last night in London, he had another in the company of his fellow poet Louis MacNeice.

Thomas arrived in New York on 20 October 1953 to undertake further performances of Under Milk Wood, organised by John Brinnin, his American agent and Director of the Poetry Centre. Brinnin did not travel to New York but remained in Boston to write. He handed responsibility to his assistant, Liz Reitell, who was keen to see Thomas for the first time since their three-week romance early in the year. She met Thomas at Idlewild Airport and was shocked at his appearance. He looked pale, delicate and shaky, not his usual robust self: ""He was very ill when he got here."" After being taken by Reitell to check in at the Chelsea Hotel, Thomas took the first rehearsal of Under Milk Wood. They then went to the White Horse Tavern in Greenwich Village, before returning to the Chelsea Hotel.

The next day, Reitell invited him to her apartment, but he declined. They went sightseeing, but Thomas felt unwell and retired to his bed for the rest of the afternoon. Reitell gave him half a grain (32.4 milligrams) of phenobarbitone to help him sleep and spent the night at the hotel with him. Two days later, on 23 October, at the third rehearsal, Thomas said he was too ill to take part, but he struggled on, shivering and burning with fever, before collapsing on the stage.

The following day, 24 October, Reitell took Thomas to see her doctor, Milton Feltenstein, who administered cortisone injections and Thomas made it through the first performance that evening, but collapsed immediately afterwards. ""This circus out there,"" he told a friend who had come back-stage, ""has taken the life out of me for now."" Reitell later said that Feltenstein was ""rather a wild doctor who thought injections would cure anything.""

At the next performance on 25 October, his fellow actors realised that Thomas was very ill: ""He was desperately ill…we didn't think that he would be able to do the last performance because he was so ill…Dylan literally couldn't speak he was so ill…still my greatest memory of it is that he had no voice.""

On the evening of 27 October, Thomas attended his 39th birthday party but felt unwell and returned to his hotel after an hour. The next day, he took part in Poetry and the Film, a recorded symposium at Cinema 16.

A turning point came on 2 November. Air pollution in New York had risen significantly and exacerbated chest illnesses such as Thomas had. By the end of the month, over 200 New Yorkers had died from the smog.

On 3 November, Thomas spent most of the day in his room, entertaining various friends. He went out in the evening to keep two drink appointments. After returning to the hotel, he went out again for a drink at 2 am. After drinking at the White Horse,  Thomas returned to the Hotel Chelsea, declaring, ""I've had eighteen straight whiskies. I think that's the record!"" The barman and the owner of the pub who served him later commented that Thomas could not have drunk more than half that amount.

Thomas had an appointment at a clam house in New Jersey with Todd on 4 November. When Todd telephoned the Chelsea that morning, Thomas said he was feeling ill and postponed the engagement. Todd thought he sounded ""terrible"". The poet, Harvey Breit, was another to phone that morning. He thought that Thomas sounded ""bad"". Thomas's voice, recalled Breit, was ""low and hoarse"". He had wanted to say: ""You sound as though from the tomb"", but instead he told Thomas that he sounded like Louis Armstrong.

Later, Thomas went drinking with Reitell at the White Horse and, feeling sick again, returned to the hotel. Feltenstein came to see him three times that day, administering the cortisone secretant ACTH by injection and, on his third visit, half a grain (32.4 milligrams) of morphine sulphate, which affected Thomas's breathing. Reitell became increasingly concerned and telephoned Feltenstein for advice. He suggested she get male assistance, so she called upon the painter Jack Heliker, who arrived before 11 pm. At midnight on 5 November, Thomas's breathing became more difficult and his face turned blue. Reitell phoned Feltenstein who arrived at the hotel at about 1 am, and called for an ambulance. It then took another hour for the ambulance to arrive at St. Vincent's, even though it was only a few blocks from the Chelsea.

Thomas was admitted to the emergency ward at St Vincent's Hospital at 1:58 am. He was comatose, and his medical notes state that ""the impression upon admission was acute alcoholic encephalopathy damage to the brain by alcohol, for which the patient was treated without response"". Feltenstein then took control of Thomas's care, even though he did not have admitting rights at St. Vincent's. The hospital's senior brain specialist, Dr. C.G. Gutierrez-Mahoney, was not called to examine Thomas until the afternoon of 6 November, some thirty-six hours after Thomas's admission.

Caitlin flew to America the following day and was taken to the hospital, by which time a tracheotomy had been performed. Her reported first words were, ""Is the bloody man dead yet?"" She was allowed to see Thomas only for 40 minutes in the morning but returned in the afternoon and, in a drunken rage, threatened to kill John Brinnin. When she became uncontrollable, she was put in a straitjacket and committed, by Feltenstein, to the River Crest private psychiatric detox clinic on Long Island.

It is now believed that Thomas had been suffering from bronchitis, pneumonia, emphysema and asthma before his admission to St Vincent's. In their 2004 paper, Death by Neglect, D. N. Thomas and Dr Simon Barton disclose that Thomas was found to have pneumonia when he was admitted to hospital in a coma. Doctors took three hours to restore his breathing, using artificial respiration and oxygen. Summarising their findings, they conclude: ""The medical notes indicate that, on admission, Dylan's bronchial disease was found to be very extensive, affecting upper, mid and lower lung fields, both left and right."" The forensic pathologist, Professor Bernard Knight, concurs: ""death was clearly due to a severe lung infection with extensive advanced bronchopneumonia...the severity of the chest infection, with greyish consolidated areas of well-established pneumonia, suggests that it had started before admission to hospital.""

Thomas died at noon on 9 November, having never recovered from his coma.

Aftermath

Rumours circulated of a brain haemorrhage, followed by competing reports of a mugging or even that Thomas had drunk himself to death. Later, speculation arose about drugs and diabetes. At the post-mortem, the pathologist found three causes of death – pneumonia, brain swelling and a fatty liver. Despite the poet's heavy drinking, his liver showed no sign of cirrhosis.

The publication of John Brinnin's 1955 biography Dylan Thomas in America cemented Thomas's legacy as the ""doomed poet""; Brinnin focuses on Thomas's last few years and paints a picture of him as a drunk and a philanderer. Later biographies have criticised Brinnin's view, especially his coverage of Thomas's death. David Thomas in Fatal Neglect: Who Killed Dylan Thomas? claims that Brinnin, along with Reitell and Feltenstein, were culpable. FitzGibbon's 1965 biography ignores Thomas's heavy drinking and skims over his death, giving just two pages in his detailed book to Thomas's demise. Ferris in his 1989 biography includes Thomas's heavy drinking, but is more critical of those around him in his final days and does not draw the conclusion that he drank himself to death. Many sources have criticised Feltenstein's role and actions, especially his incorrect diagnosis of delirium tremens and the high dose of morphine he administered. Dr C. G. de Gutierrez-Mahoney, the doctor who treated Thomas while at St. Vincents, concluded that Feltenstein's failure to see that Thomas was gravely ill and have him admitted to hospital sooner ""was even more culpable than his use of morphine"".

Caitlin Thomas's autobiographies, Caitlin Thomas – Leftover Life to Kill (1957) and My Life with Dylan Thomas: Double Drink Story (1997), describe the effects of alcohol on the poet and on their relationship. ""Ours was not only a love story, it was a drink story, because without alcohol it would never had got on its rocking feet"", she wrote, and ""The bar was our altar."" Biographer Andrew Lycett ascribed the decline in Thomas's health to an alcoholic co-dependent relationship with his wife, who deeply resented his extramarital affairs. In contrast, Dylan biographers Andrew Sinclair and George Tremlett express the view that Thomas was not an alcoholic. Tremlett argues that many of Thomas's health issues stemmed from undiagnosed diabetes.

Thomas died intestate, with assets worth £100. His body was brought back to Wales for burial in the village churchyard at Laugharne. Thomas's funeral, which Brinnin did not attend, took place at St Martin's Church in Laugharne on 24 November. Six friends from the village carried Thomas's coffin. Caitlin, without her customary hat, walked behind the coffin, with his childhood friend Daniel Jones at her arm and her mother by her side. The procession to the church was filmed and the wake took place at Brown's Hotel. Thomas's fellow poet and long-time friend Vernon Watkins wrote The Times obituary.

Thomas's widow, Caitlin, died in 1994 and was buried alongside him. Thomas's father ""DJ"" died on 16 December 1952 and his mother Florence in August 1958. Thomas's elder son, Llewelyn, died in 2000, his daughter, Aeronwy in 2009 and his youngest son Colm in 2012.

Poetry

Poetic style and influences
Thomas's refusal to align with any literary group or movement has made him and his work difficult to categorise.
Although influenced by the modern symbolism and surrealism movements he refused to follow such creeds. Instead, critics view Thomas as part of the modernism and romanticism movements,
though attempts to pigeon-hole him within a particular neo-romantic school have been unsuccessful. Elder Olson, in his 1954 critical study of Thomas's poetry, wrote of ""... a further characteristic which distinguished Thomas's work from that of other poets. It was unclassifiable.""
Olson continued that in a postmodern age that continually attempted to demand that poetry have social reference, none could be found in Thomas's work, and that his work was so obscure that critics could not explicate it.

Thomas's verbal style played against strict verse forms, such as in the villanelle ""Do not go gentle into that good night"". His images appear carefully ordered in a patterned sequence, and his major theme was the unity of all life, the continuing process of life and death and new life that linked the generations. Thomas saw biology as a magical transformation producing unity out of diversity, and in his poetry sought a poetic ritual to celebrate this unity. He saw men and women locked in cycles of growth, love, procreation, new growth, death, and new life. Therefore, each image engenders its opposite. Thomas derived his closely woven, sometimes self-contradictory images from the Bible, Welsh folklore, preaching, and Sigmund Freud.  Explaining the source of his imagery, Thomas wrote in a letter to Glyn Jones: ""My own obscurity is quite an unfashionable one, based, as it is, on a preconceived symbolism derived (I'm afraid all this sounds wooly and pretentious) from the cosmic significance of the human anatomy"".

Thomas's early poetry was noted for its verbal density, alliteration, sprung rhythm and internal rhyme, and some critics detected the influence of the English poet Gerard Manley Hopkins. This is attributed to Hopkins, who taught himself Welsh and who used sprung verse, bringing some features of Welsh poetic metre into his work. When Henry Treece wrote to Thomas comparing his style to that of Hopkins, Thomas wrote back denying any such influence. Thomas greatly admired Thomas Hardy, who is regarded as an influence. When Thomas travelled in America, he recited some of Hardy's work in his readings.

Other poets from whom critics believe Thomas drew influence include James Joyce, Arthur Rimbaud and D. H. Lawrence. William York Tindall, in his 1962 study, A Reader's Guide to Dylan Thomas, finds comparison between Thomas's and Joyce's wordplay, while he notes the themes of rebirth and nature are common to the works of Lawrence and Thomas. Although Thomas described himself as the ""Rimbaud of Cwmdonkin Drive"", he stated that the phrase ""Swansea's Rimbaud"" was coined by poet Roy Campbell. Critics have explored the origins of Thomas's mythological pasts in his works such as ""The Orchards"", which Ann Elizabeth Mayer believes reflects the Welsh myths of the Mabinogion.
Thomas's poetry is notable for its musicality, most clear in ""Fern Hill"", ""In Country Sleep"", ""Ballad of the Long-legged Bait"" and ""In the White Giant's Thigh"" from Under Milk Wood.

Thomas once confided that the poems which had most influenced him were Mother Goose rhymes which his parents taught him when he was a child:
I should say I wanted to write poetry in the beginning because I had fallen in love with words. The first poems I knew were nursery rhymes and before I could read them for myself I had come to love the words of them. The words alone. What the words stood for was of a very secondary importance ... I fell in love, that is the only expression I can think of, at once, and am still at the mercy of words, though sometimes now, knowing a little of their behaviour very well, I think I can influence them slightly and have even learned to beat them now and then, which they appear to enjoy. I tumbled for words at once. And, when I began to read the nursery rhymes for myself, and, later, to read other verses and ballads, I knew that I had discovered the most important things, to me, that could be ever.

Thomas became an accomplished writer of prose poetry, with collections such as Portrait of the Artist as a Young Dog (1940) and Quite Early One Morning (1954) showing he was capable of writing moving short stories. His first published prose work, After the Fair, appeared in The New English Weekly on 15 March 1934. Jacob Korg believes that one can classify Thomas's fiction work into two main bodies: vigorous fantasies in a poetic style and, after 1939, more straightforward narratives.
Korg surmises that Thomas approached his prose writing as an alternate poetic form, which allowed him to produce complex, involuted narratives that do not allow the reader to rest.

Welsh poet

Thomas disliked being regarded as a provincial poet and decried any notion of 'Welshness' in his poetry. When he wrote to Stephen Spender in 1952, thanking him for a review of his Collected Poems, he added ""Oh, & I forgot. I'm not influenced by Welsh bardic poetry. I can't read Welsh."" Despite this his work was rooted in the geography of Wales. Thomas acknowledged that he returned to Wales when he had difficulty writing, and John Ackerman argues that ""His inspiration and imagination were rooted in his Welsh background"". Caitlin Thomas wrote that he worked ""in a fanatically narrow groove, although there was nothing narrow about the depth and understanding of his feelings. The groove of direct hereditary descent in the land of his birth, which he never in thought, and hardly in body, moved out of.""

Head of Programmes Wales at the BBC, Aneirin Talfan Davies, who commissioned several of Thomas's early radio talks, believed that the poet's ""whole attitude is that of the medieval bards."" Kenneth O. Morgan counter-argues that it is a 'difficult enterprise' to find traces of cynghanedd (consonant harmony) or cerdd dafod (tongue-craft) in Thomas's poetry. Instead he believes his work, especially his earlier more autobiographical poems, are rooted in a changing country which echoes the Welshness of the past and the Anglicisation of the new industrial nation: ""rural and urban, chapel-going and profane, Welsh and English, Unforgiving and deeply compassionate."" Fellow poet and critic Glyn Jones believed that any traces of cynghanedd in Thomas's work were accidental, although he felt Thomas consciously employed one element of Welsh metrics; that of counting syllables per line instead of feet. Constantine Fitzgibbon, who was his first in-depth biographer, wrote ""No major English poet has ever been as Welsh as Dylan"".

Although Thomas had a deep connection with Wales, he disliked Welsh nationalism. He once wrote, ""Land of my fathers, and my fathers can keep it"". While often attributed to Thomas himself, this line actually comes from the character Owen Morgan-Vaughan, in the screenplay Thomas wrote for the 1948 British melodrama The Three Weird Sisters. Robert Pocock, a friend from the BBC, recalled ""I only once heard Dylan express an opinion on Welsh Nationalism. He used three words. Two of them were Welsh Nationalism."" Although not expressed as strongly, Glyn Jones believed that he and Thomas's friendship cooled in the later years as he had not 'rejected enough' of the elements that Thomas disliked – ""Welsh nationalism and a sort of hill farm morality"". Apologetically, in a letter to Keidrych Rhys, editor of the literary magazine Wales, Thomas's father wrote that he was ""afraid Dylan isn't much of a Welshman"". Though FitzGibbon asserts that Thomas's negativity towards Welsh nationalism was fostered by his father's hostility towards the Welsh language.

Critical reception
Thomas's work and stature as a poet have been much debated by critics and biographers since his death. Critical studies have been clouded by Thomas's personality and mythology, especially his drunken persona and death in New York. When Seamus Heaney gave an Oxford lecture on the poet he opened by addressing the assembly, ""Dylan Thomas is now as much a case history as a chapter in the history of poetry"", querying how 'Thomas the Poet' is one of his forgotten attributes. David Holbrook, who has written three books about Thomas, stated in his 1962 publication Llareggub Revisited, ""the strangest feature of Dylan Thomas's notoriety—not that he is bogus, but that attitudes to poetry attached themselves to him which not only threaten the prestige, effectiveness and accessibility to English poetry, but also destroyed his true voice and, at last, him."" The Poetry Archive notes that ""Dylan Thomas's detractors accuse him of being drunk on language as well as whiskey, but whilst there's no doubt that the sound of language is central to his style, he was also a disciplined writer who re-drafted obsessively"".

Many critics have argued that Thomas's work is too narrow and that he suffers from verbal extravagance. Those that have championed his work have found the criticism baffling. Robert Lowell wrote in 1947, ""Nothing could be more wrongheaded than the English disputes about Dylan Thomas's greatness ... He is a dazzling obscure writer who can be enjoyed without understanding."" Kenneth Rexroth said, on reading Eighteen Poems, ""The reeling excitement of a poetry-intoxicated schoolboy smote the Philistine as hard a blow with one small book as Swinburne had with Poems and Ballads."" Philip Larkin in a letter to Kingsley Amis in 1948, wrote that ""no one can 'stick words into us like pins'... like he [Thomas] can"", but followed that by stating that he ""doesn't use his words to any advantage"". Amis was far harsher, finding little of merit in his work, and claiming that he was 'frothing at the mouth with piss.' In 1956, the publication of the anthology New Lines featuring works by the British collective The Movement, which included Amis and Larkin amongst its number, set out a vision of modern poetry that was damning towards the poets of the 1940s. Thomas's work in particular was criticised. David Lodge, writing about The Movement in 1981 stated ""Dylan Thomas was made to stand for everything they detest, verbal obscurity, metaphysical pretentiousness, and romantic rhapsodizing"".

Despite criticism by sections of academia, Thomas's work has been embraced by readers more so than many of his contemporaries, and is one of the few modern poets whose name is recognised by the general public. In 2009, over 18,000 votes were cast in a BBC poll to find the UK's favourite poet; Thomas was placed 10th. Several of his poems have passed into the cultural mainstream, and his work has been used by authors, musicians and film and television writers. The BBC Radio programme, Desert Island Discs, in which guests usually choose their favourite songs, has heard 50 participants select a Dylan Thomas recording. John Goodby states that this popularity with the reading public allows Thomas's work to be classed as vulgar and common. He also cites that despite a brief period during the 1960s when Thomas was considered a cultural icon, that the poet has been marginalized in critical circles due to his exuberance, in both life and work, and his refusal to know his place. Goodby believes that Thomas has been mainly snubbed since the 1970s and has become ""... an embarrassment to twentieth-century poetry criticism"", his work failing to fit standard narratives and thus being ignored rather than studied.

In June 2022 Thomas was the subject of BBC Radio 4's In Our Time.

Memorials

In Swansea's maritime quarter are the Dylan Thomas Theatre, home of the Swansea Little Theatre of which Thomas was once a member, and the former Guildhall built in 1825 and now occupied by the Dylan Thomas Centre, a literature centre, where exhibitions and lectures are held and setting for the annual Dylan Thomas Festival. Outside the centre stands a bronze statue of Thomas, by John Doubleday. Another monument to Thomas stands in Cwmdonkin Park, one of his favourite childhood haunts, close to his birthplace. The memorial is a small rock in an enclosed garden within the park cut by and inscribed by the late sculptor Ronald Cour  with the closing lines from Fern Hill.
Oh as I was young and easy in the mercy of his means
Time held me green and dying
Though I sang in my chains like the sea.

Thomas's home in Laugharne, the Boathouse, is a museum run by Carmarthenshire County Council. Thomas's writing shed is also preserved. In 2004, the Dylan Thomas Prize was created in his honour, awarded to the best published writer in English under the age of 30. In 2005, the Dylan Thomas Screenplay Award was established. The prize, administered by the Dylan Thomas Centre, is awarded at the annual Swansea Bay Film Festival. In 1982 a plaque was unveiled in Poets' Corner, Westminster Abbey. The plaque is also inscribed with the last two lines of Fern Hill.

In 2014, the Royal Patron of The Dylan Thomas 100 Festival was Charles, Prince of Wales, who made a recording of Fern Hill for the event.

In 2014, to celebrate the centenary of Thomas's birth, the British Council Wales undertook a year-long programme of cultural and educational works. Highlights included a touring replica of Thomas's work shed, Sir Peter Blake's exhibition of illustrations based on Under Milk Wood and a 36-hour marathon of readings, which included Michael Sheen and Sir Ian McKellen performing Thomas's work.

The actor Dylan Sprouse is named after him.

Life
The Dictionary of National Biography gives tentative information. He may be identical with the Christopher Middleton of Cheshire who matriculated from Brasenose College, Oxford, 12 December 1580, aged 20. A clergyman of the same name, who graduated B.D. from St. John's College, Cambridge, in 1619, was rector of Aston-le-Walls, Northamptonshire, from 1612 till his death there in 1628.

Works
Middleton was the author of:

A Short Introduction for to Learn to Swimme, gathered out of Master Digbies Booke of the Art of Swimming, and translated into English for the better instruction of those who understand not the Latin tongue, by Christopher Middleton, 1595, 4to. This was illustrated with woodcuts of persons swimming, and was a translation of the De Arte Natandi libri duo, 1587, of Everard Digby.
The Historie of Heaven: containing the Poetical Fictions of all the Starres in the Firmament, gathered from amongst all the Poets and Astronomers, by Chrystopher Middleton. Printed for him 1596. 
The Famous Historie of Chinon of England, with his Strange Adventures for the love of Celestina, daughter to Lewis, King of France; with the worthy Atchivement of Sir Lancelot du Lake, and Sir Tristram du Lions for faire Laura, daughter to Cadar, Earle of Cornewall, being all Knights of King Arthur's Round Table. By Chr. Middleton. At London, printed by John Danter for Cuthbert Burbie, 1597. 
The Legend of Humphrey, Duke of Glocester, by Chr. Middleton. London, printed by E. A. for Nicholas Ling, 1600. The author dedicates this poem to Sir Jarvis Clifton. It is preceded by a Latin hexastichon by Robert Allott, a sonnet by Michael Drayton, and two short poems by John Weever. The poem, consisting of 184 six-line stanzas, is written on the plan of the poems in the Mirror for Magistrates.

4825,"['Tomorrow This Is ?', 'Tomorrow This Is ?']","Is This Tomorrow? is a comic strip, created by Kelly Shane and Woody Compton, begun as a college newspaper feature in 1991 and revived as a webcomic in 2003.  The comic is experimental in form and though it includes recurring characters, the subject matter and style often varies from strip to strip.  The name was taken from the anti-Communist comic book Is This Tomorrow published in 1947 by the Catechetical Guild Educational Society of St. Paul, Minnesota.

History 

In its original incarnation, the strip appeared on a semi-regular basis from 1991 to 1992 in the Florida Flambeau, a student-run newspaper affiliated with Florida State University and Florida A&M in Tallahassee, FL.

The strip was revived as a webcomic on July 14, 2003, and ran weekly until June 7, 2004.  Occasional strips were posted in 2004 and 2005.
On September 4, 2006, the strip began a weekly series titled Aether Transmission, which is still ongoing.  Though still varying in subject matter, writing style and graphic presentation, these strips are uniform in size and employ reoccurring characters.

3-D and other special strips 

Is This Tomorrow? has done strips and features utilizing 3-D, including the first anaglyphic 3-D webcomic, ""First Anniversary Comic (in 3-D)"" (also titled ""Atheists From Outer Space""), on July 12, 2004.  The July 12, 2010 comic ""Post-Modern Love in 1.5-D"" utilizes anaglyphic 3-D glasses to allow two images to appear in the last panel, letting the reader choose between a happy or unhappy ending.  The strip ""Hypno-Illusio-Vision"" (August 2, 2010) uses an optical illusion as part of the story and design.

The comic's creators collaborated with musician Coconut Monkeyrocket on the December 21, 2009 strip ""I.T.T. Breaks the Sound Barrier ,"" a comic utilizing sound loops.

Reprints 

The strip ""Thomas Pynchon: Man of Mystery"" was reprinted as an accompany graphic to an article in the 2009 edition of the Encyclopædia Universalis, a French language encyclopedia.

Texts from the strips ""The Annotated Steve Ditko Story Part 1"" and ""Steve Ditko Part 2"" were reprinted as a biography of Steve Ditko in The Thunder Agents Companion (TwoMorrows Publishing), edited by Jon B. Cooke.

It is particularly known for its Word of the Year, political analysis, college and university rankings,  High Tech buzzwords, and media analytics.

History 
Founded in Silicon Valley in 2003 by Paul J.J. Payack, the GLM describes its role as ""a media analytics company that documents, analyzes and tracks cultural trends in language the world over, with a particular emphasis upon International and Global English"".  GLM's main services include various products based on the Narrative Tracker technologies for global Internet and social media analysis.

In April 2008, GLM moved its headquarters from San Diego to Austin.

In July 2020, GLM announced that 'Covid' was the Top Word of 2020 for Global or International English.   

Covid is the commonly used shorthand for the shorthand for Covid-19.  Covid-19 is the official name of the virus caused by the SARS CoV-2 virus, so named in WHO’s International Classification of Diseases (ICD). ‘Covid’ has received the highest number of citations ever recorded in our global survey.  In fact, ‘covid’ has outranked all previous Words of the Year in the 21st century by a factor of 100.

Covid-19 is ranked No. 2. The Top Ten Words of the Year (#WOTY) for 2020 include Covid, Covid-19, Coronavirus, Corona, Face mask, Progress, Truth, Social Distancing, Trade War, and Sustainability.  Typically, the Global Language Monitor ranks words, phrases, and names on three separate lists, and the lists are limited to twenty items.  For this effort, GLM has combined the lists and extended the word count to fifty items.

Annual fashion capital rankings
An annual ranking of the leading fashion capitals is produced by Global Language Monitor, a US-based company that tracks trends through language use worldwide. The 2017 top-sixty three fashion capitals, according to its rankings, are listed below.

Commentary from Global Language Monitor About the 2017 edition of its annual fashion capital rankings
The current 2017 rankings now include 63 fashion capitals.  There are three new fashion capitals from West Africa:  Accra, Ghana; Dakar, Senegal; and Lagos, Nigeria.  There is one new fashion capital from East Asia: Kuala Lumpur.  There is one new fashion capital from the Middle East:  Beirut, Lebanon.  Before the various insurgencies in the region,  Beirut was known as the Paris of the Middle East.   There are two new fashion capitals from North America:  Portland, Oregon known for its ‘weird’ culture, much like Austin, Texas and Columbus, Ohio known in the fashion world as the manufacturing headquarters of Henri Bendel, Victoria’s Secret, the Bath & Body Works, Abercrombie & Fitch (A&F), and others.

Commentary from Global Language Monitor individual cities in the 2017 edition

No. 3 Barcelona — Moving into Big Four Territory is Big News by definition.

No. 4 Milano — Reclaiming its Big Four status; hmm, perhaps all that re-thinking and revamping just might be having an impact (we’ll see in 2018).

No. 6 London — Had a great run earlier in the decade, but not so great lately (If you consider the No. 6 spot not so great).

No. 7 Amsterdam — Moving up 15 spots is quite a move.

No. 9 Vegas — Back in the Top Ten, more evidence that the Red Carpet experience does indeed have an impact.

No. 10 Dubai — More evidence that billions of dollars Do, indeed, have an impact.

No. 17 Seoul — Finally making the move in Asia, not No. 1, but a respectable No. 3 regionally.

No. 21 Washington, DC — A move into respectability!?

No. 28 Melbourne and No. 34 Sydney — Trading Places

No. 44 Portland, OR — A very nice debut.

No. 47 Kuala Lumpur — Another solid debut.

No. 46 Boston, No. 48 Miami, No.53 Chicago, No. 54 Houston, and No. 59 Toronto — All down by twenty spots, or more.

No. 63  Caracas — On Hiatus due to Insurrection.

Methodology: For this analysis, the Global Language Monitor used its proprietary Brand Affiliation Index (BAI), the same technology used to measure global brand equity for the Olympics, World Cup, the Fortune 500, and others. This exclusive, GLM longitudinal-study encompasses the prior three years to better assess short-term velocity and longer-term momentum. The study is a Big Data textual analysis based on billions of webpages, millions of blogs, the top 375,000 global print and electronic media, and new social media formats as they appear. This is the eleventh edition of the survey, which was first made public in 2007.

High tech terms 

On March 29, 2013 announced The Most Confusing High Tech Buzzwords of the Second Decade of the 21st century, thus far (2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013) with commentary follow:

2013 Rank, Buzzword, Last Year’s rank

 Big Data (1) — Soon Human Knowledge will be doubling every second.  ’Big’ does not begin to describe what’s coming at us. 
 Dark Data (New)- Might not have noticed it because … it is ‘Dark Data’   ‘Big Data’ has begun to spin off its own superlatives.
 The Cloud (2) — All that data has got to go somewhere.  Hint:  it’s neither your phone nor your tablet.
 Yottabytes (New) – Showing up on lots of technologists’ radar lately:  a quadrillion gigabytes.
 The Next Big Thing (3) — A cliché rendered ever more meaningless but still on everyone’s tongue.
 Heisenbug (New) – A bug that disappears when you try to detect it, finally making the list after a steady ascent over the last decade.
 3-D Printer (New) – Watch this space.  This technology has been used in CAD design for years and science fiction for decades — but now they are impinging upon everyday life. 
 Phablet (New) – The Next Big Thing? The odds are against it since consumer goods tend to evolve into single-purpose appliances.
 REST (New) – Representational State transfer is slowly climbing its way up the list.
 Web X.0 (5) — Formerly Web 2.0, 3.0, etc.

The study was released in conjunction with Austin's South by Southwest Interactive festival.

On March 17, 2010, the Global Language Monitor presented the Most Confusing High Tech Buzzwords of the first decade of the 21st century (2000–2009).

 HTTP — HyperText Transfer Protocol is used for HTML (HyperText Markup Language) files. 
 Flash — As in Flash Memory.  ""Flash’  is easier to say than "" I brought the report on my EEPROM chip with a thin oxide layer separating a floating gate and control gate utilizing Fowler-Nordheim electron tunneling"".
 God Particle – The Higgs boson, thought to account for mass.  The God Particle has eluded discovery since its existence was first postulated some thirty years ago.
 Cloud computing – Distributing or accessing programs and services across the Internet. (The Internet is represented as a cloud.)
 Plasma (as in plasma TV) — Refers to a kind of television screen technology that uses matrix of gas plasma cells, which are charged by differing electrical voltages to create an image.
 iPod – Apple maintains that the idea of the iPod was from the film 2001: A Space Odyssey.  
 Megapixel – One million pixels or picture elements.
 Nano – Widely used to describe anything small as in nanotechnology. Like the word ‘mini’ which originally referred to the red hues in Italian miniature paintings, the word nano- is ultimately derived from the ancient Greek word for ‘dwarf’.
 Resonate – Not the tendency of a system to oscillate at maximum amplitude, but the ability to relate to (or resonate with) a customer’s desires.
 Virtualization – Around since the late ‘70s, virtualization now applies to everything from infrastructures to I/O.

On November 19, 2008 Global Language Monitor announced the most confusing yet frequently cited high tech buzzwords of 2008 to be cloud computing, green washing, and buzzword compliant followed by resonate, de-duping, and virtualization.  Rounding out the Top Ten were Web 2.0, versioning, word clouds, and petaflop.  The most confusing Acronym for 2008 was SaaS (software as a service).

On 14 October 2007 GLM released a list of the most confusing high tech terms and buzzwords. The words included:

iPod,
flash,
cookie,
nano and
kernel,
followed by
megahertz,
cell
(as in
cell phone),
plasma,
de-duplication
and
Blu-Ray.
Other terms being tracked included
terabyte,
memory,
core,
and head crash.
The most confusing acronym was found to be SOA, for service-oriented architecture, an acronym which IBM published a book about.
 
The studies were released each year on the anniversary of the cookie, the invention that made the World Wide Web practical for widespread surfing, communication, and e-commerce.

Counting English words
GLM announced the 1,000,000th English word on June 10, 2009.  This controversial exercise was widely covered in the global media.  The count itself was widely criticized by a number of prominent linguists, including Geoffrey Nunberg, and Jesse Sheidlower and Benjamin Zimmer, on the grounds that since there is no generally accepted definition of a word, there can never be a definitive count.

The finalists, which met the criteria of a minimum of 25,000 citations with the necessary breadth of geographic distribution and depth of citations, were:

1. Web 2.0.  2. Jai Ho!  3. N00b.  4. Slumdog.  5. Cloud computing.  6. Carbon Neutral.  7. Slow Food.  8. Octomom.  9. Greenwashing.  10. Sexting.  11. Shovel ready.  12. Defriend.  13. Chengguan.  14. Recessionista.  15. Zombie Banks.

Critics noted that the target date had been changed a number of times from late in 2006 to early in 2009. It was also criticized on grounds that a count is impossible because ""word"" is not a scientifically valid concept.  Google addressed this situation by counting the words in the 15 million scanned texts in their corpus. Global Language Monitor states the general criteria for inclusion on its site, maintaining that it is simply updating the established criteria for printed dictionaries beginning with the works of Samuel Johnson and Noah Webster.

The New York Times quoted Paul JJ Payack as saying that the PQI is ""an algorithm that tracks words and phrases in the media and on the Internet in relation to frequency, context and appearance in global media.  It is a weighted index that takes into account year-to-year increases and acceleration in the last several months"". In general terms, GLM describes its Predictive Quantities Indicator (PQI), used to run its analytics on global language trends and, as a weighted index, factoring in long-term trends, short-term changes, momentum and velocity, using frequency data on words and phrases in the global print and electronic media, on the Internet, and throughout the blogosphere, as well as in proprietary databases (Factiva, Lexis-Nexis, etc.). It can also create ""signals"" that can be used in a variety of applications.

Obama an English language word 
On 20 February 2008 GLM announced that the latest word to enter the English language was ""obama"", derived from Barack Obama, in its many variations.  GLM described Obama- as a ""root"" for words including obamanomics, obamican, obamamentum, obamacize, obamarama, obamaNation, Obamafy, obamamania and obamacam. GLM announced it to be an accepted word, once it met the group's published criteria: a minimum of 25,000 citations in the global media, as well as achieving the necessary 'breadth' and 'depth' of citations.

5054,['America Built Who ?'],"Marcus Rediker (born 1951 in Owensboro, Kentucky) is an American professor, historian, writer, and activist for a variety of peace and social justice causes. He graduated with a B.A. from Virginia Commonwealth University in 1976 and attended the University of Pennsylvania for graduate study, earning an M.A. and Ph.D. in history. He taught at Georgetown University from 1982 to 1994, lived in Moscow for a year (1984-5), and is currently Distinguished Professor of Atlantic History of the Department of History at the University of Pittsburgh.

Scholarship
Rediker has written several books on Atlantic social, labor, and maritime history.  Informed by the Marxist critique of capitalism, they explore their respective subjects in systemic terms while emphasizing human class-consciousness and agency.  In the introduction to Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea, for example, he explains:

Rediker's approach can yield surprising discoveries and perspectives—like the egalitarianism of some pirate crews. ""Pirates used the precapitalist share system to apportion their take,"" he argues in Villains of All Nations:

His most recent scholarship has turned to the related topics of the transatlantic slave trade and slave uprisings.

Awards
Rediker has won a number of awards for his works such as the George Washington Book Prize (2008), OAH Merle Curti Award (2008), National Endowment for the Humanities Fellow (2005–2006), American Council of Learned Societies Fellow (2005–2006) Distinguished Lecturer, OAH (2002–08), International Labor History Book Prize (2001), OAH Merle Curti Social History Book Award (1988) and ASA John Hope Franklin Book Prize (1988)

5113,['Drink I Shall What ?'],"Reuben Dimond Mussey, Sr. (June 23, 1780 – June 21, 1866) was an American physician, surgeon, vegetarian and an early opponent of tobacco. He was the fourth president of the American Medical Association.

Biography

Mussey was born on June 23, 1780, in Rockingham County, New Hampshire. He was of French Huguenot descent, and his father, John Mussey, was also a medical doctor.  Mussey studied at Dartmouth College and then learned medicine under Nathan Smith. He began the practice of medicine in Essex County, Massachusetts. However, he then went to the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine where he did further medical studies, graduating M.D. in 1809. Among his professors at the University of Pennsylvania was Benjamin Rush. Mussey was elected an Associate Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1811.

He then was a professor at the medical school at Dartmouth College and also at Middlebury College, as well as serving as a medical lecturer at other institutions. Mussey is credited as the first surgeon to tie both carotid arteries in 1829. He lectured on anatomy and surgery at Bowdoin College (1831-1835) and Fairfield Academy (1836-1838). He was professor of surgery at the Medical College of Ohio (1838-1852) and was chair of surgery at Miami Medical College in Cincinnati (1852-1857).

Mussey was an advocate of the temperance movement. In 1828, a temperance society was founded at Dartmouth. In 1850 he served as president of the American Medical Association.

He was awarded an LL.D from Dartmouth in 1854 and an honorary A. M. in 1806 from Harvard University.

Mussey died on June 21, 1866 in Boston.

Family

His son Reuben D. Mussey, Jr. was a lawyer and the husband of Ellen Spencer Mussey, the founder of the first law school for females.

Mussey and his first wife Mary Sewall did not have any children. After her death he married Herry Osgood, and they had nine children. Besides Reuben Jr., there was also William H. Mussey and Francis B. Mussey who both followed their father into the medical profession. Charles F. Mussey became a Presbyterian minister. Mussey's daughter Maria married Lyman Mason, and his daughter Catharine married Shattuck Hartwell.

Vegetarianism

Mussey was a vegetarian who abstained from alcohol and tobacco. In 1832, Mussey ""gave up the eating of flesh as an experiment"", he did not eat the flesh of land animals for the rest of his life but occasionally consumed fish in 1850. He was a frequent contributor to William Alcott's vegetarian journal Library of Health. His 1862 book Health: Its Friends and Foes included chapters on vegetarianism and on the dangers of tobacco. It was positively reviewed in the Cincinnati Lancet and Observer 
and The New England Journal of Medicine.

Mussey was a founding member and vice-president of the American Vegetarian Society in the 1850s.

5199,"[""me like it doing 's who , mean I ?""]","Paul ""Paulie"" Malignaggi (; ; born November 23, 1980) is an American former professional boxer who competed from 2001 to 2017 and has since worked as a boxing commentator and analyst. He held world championships in two weight classes, including the IBF junior welterweight title from 2007 to 2008, and the WBA welterweight title from 2012 to 2013. Malignaggi competed once as a bare knuckle boxer in 2019 in a loss to MMA fighter Artem Lobov (record 13-15-1).  Malignaggi was particularly known for his hand speed, boxing ability, athleticism, and durable chin.

Early life
Malignaggi was born to Italian immigrant parents. He spent most of his early days in Syracuse, Sicily. Six years later, after Malignaggi's brother Umberto was born, the family decided to settle back in Brooklyn, but Malignaggi's father stayed for only a few weeks before returning to Italy. Malignaggi's mother remarried. The two brothers reputedly did not get along with their new stepfather. In 1996, the pair got into a fight with their stepfather. Not long after, the brothers left the house. Malignaggi then lived with his grandparents until he got his own home years later. Malignaggi used to violate school rules. He regularly got involved in street fights, using knives and sometimes guns. He was eventually expelled from high school for street fights and ditching classes. His grandfather took him to work each day until Malignaggi asked that he be allowed to take up boxing. He was given the chance, marking Malignaggi's transition into boxing.

Professional career

Light welterweight 
Upon turning pro in 2001, Malignaggi won his first 21 fights.

Malignaggi vs. Cotto 
Malignaggi fought for his first world title, the WBO light welterweight title against Miguel Cotto. The fight took place on June 10, 2006 in Madison Square Garden on TOP RANK PPV. Cotto opened a cut over Malignaggi's right eye in the first round, which, according to Malignaggi, affected his performance over the course of the fight, by stating ""this was the first time in which I was cut, and the blood kept going into my eye. And it bothered me the entire fight. I was not able to see very well. Cotto's a great fighter, but I'm disappointed, as I wanted to be the champion"". Cotto won the fight by unanimous decision with scores of 116–111, 116–111, and 115–112. Malignaggi suffered a fractured right orbital bone and his jaw was injured, he was taken to Roosevelt Hospital after the fight's outcome was announced.

Malignaggi vs. Cherry, N'dou 
Malignaggi got back on track with a unanimous decision victory over Edner Cherry at the Hammerstein Ballroom in New York City, February 17, 2007.

On June 16, 2007, Malignaggi defeated Lovemore N'dou via a 12 unanimous decision to win the IBF Light Welterweight Championship at the Mohegan Sun Casino in Uncasville, Connecticut. The bout was one sided with one judge awarding the bout a 120–106. Lennox Lewis, who was commentating at ringside for HBO, described Malignaggi's performance as a ""boxing clinic."" After this win and the victory over Edner Cherry earlier in the year, Malignaggi was awarded the Ring Magazine comeback of the year award at the end of 2007.

Malignaggi vs. Ngoudjo, N'dou II 
On January 5, 2008, Malignaggi defended his title against Herman Ngoudjo in a highly competitive match held at Bally's Casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Malignaggi controlled the fight with his jab until he was stunned in the 7th round, but Ngoudjo failed to finish the job. After the seventh, Ngoudjo became ineffective with his aggression and came up short and lost a wide unanimous decision, which although fair, did not reflect the competitiveness of the fight.

On May 24, 2008, Malignaggi beat Lovemore N'Dou in a rematch by split decision to retain his IBF title at the City of Manchester Stadium in Manchester, England. Malignaggi was in control for the first half of the fight, boxing behind his faster and crisper jab. Prior to the fight, Malignaggi was sporting hair extensions which proved to be a problem throughout the fight until his trainer Buddy McGirt cut them off in his corner between rounds eight and nine. Malignaggi appeared sloppy in the second half of the fight as N'Dou came back to make the fight close. In the end, Malignaggi pulled out a close victory and also suffered a fractured right hand in the fight. Malignaggi vacated his title on September 19, 2008.

Malignaggi vs. Hatton 

On November 22, 2008 in the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, Malignaggi fought The Ring and IBO Light Welterweight Champion Ricky Hatton. It was billed as the boxer against the brawler. Hatton dominated and won every round but the first. Hatton rocked Malignaggi in the second and several other times during the fight, leaving Paulie to hold on, doing exactly what Malignaggi had publicly criticized Hatton for doing, while promoting the fight. With Malignaggi way behind on points, his trainer Buddy McGirt threw in the towel during the 11th round.

Malignaggi vs. Alvarado cancellation 
Malignaggi was going to fight Mike Alvarado but Mike suffered an elbow injury and withdrew from the fight set for June 27, 2009.

Malignaggi vs. Díaz I, II 
On August 22, 2009, at the Toyota Center in Houston, Texas, Malignaggi fought former lightweight titlist Juan Díaz for the vacant WBO NABO Light Welterweight title at a catch-weight of 138½ pounds. Unofficial HBO scorer Harold Lederman scored the fight 115–113 for Malignaggi, but none of the three judges saw the fight this way. Gale Van Hoy had it by 118–110, Raul Caiz had it 115–113 and the other Judge, Dave Sutherland scored it 116–112, all in favor of Juan Díaz. In the post fight interview of the Juan Díaz fight (interviewed by Max Kellerman, HBO boxing analyst), Paulie was furious, stating that ""boxing is full of shit."" He also stated that the only reason he is continuing to fight is because of the good pay day.

A rematch with Juan Díaz occurred on December 12, 2009, in Chicago on HBO. This rematch went in Malignaggi's favor when he defeated Juan Díaz by unanimous decision. All three judges scored the fight 116–111 in favor of Malignaggi. In the fight, Malignaggi threw more punches but only landed 21% of them while Diaz landed 28% of his, but threw fewer.

Malignaggi vs. Khan 

Malignaggi's next fight was against Amir Khan in Madison Square Garden in New York on May 15, 2010.
The press conference took place in London on March 12 on PPV while another press conference was held in New York City, United States on March 16. Malignaggi was stopped in the eleventh round by the referee. As the fight progressed, Malignaggi began to fall behind on points and the result began to get comfortable for Khan. He was very overmatched throughout the fight. This would be his last fight at Jr. welterweight, he had a very difficult time making weight for this fight and it showed in his performance. On September 28, 2010 it was announced that Malignaggi signed with Golden Boy Promotions.

Welterweight

Malignaggi vs. Senchenko, Cano 
On April 29, 2012 Malignaggi fought WBA Welterweight Champion Viacheslav Senchenko in Donetsk, Ukraine. Malignaggi won by ninth-round technical knockout to take the title.

Malignaggi then went on to defeat Pablo César Cano via split decision on October 20, 2012, on the undercard of the Erik Morales vs. Danny Garcia rematch.

Malignaggi vs. Broner 

After failing to secure a fight with fellow lightweight champion Ricky Burns, Adrien Broner decided to move up two weight classes to welterweight in order to fight Malignaggi. On March 10, 2013 the fight was made official. Richard Schaefer confirmed the fight would take place on June 22 at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn. In front of 11,461 on fight night, Broner defeated Malignaggi in a split decision, with one judge scoring the fight 115–113 for Malignaggi, and the other two scoring 117–111 and 115–113 for Broner, making him a 3 weight world champion at just 23 years of age. Malignaggi started the fight fast and aggressive, throwing many punches and applying his jab often. Broner found his timing by the middle of the fight, effectively timing Malignaggi with lead right hands and counter left hooks. CompuBox had Broner landing 246 (47%) of his total punches, and 214 (51%) of his power punches. Malignaggi landed 120 jabs throughout the fight, but only 94 (25%) power punches. Though there was some contention at ringside after the fight as to who deserved the split decision, The Associated Press agreed with the two judges who scored the fight for Broner, mirroring the score of 117–111 by one judge. Throughout the fight, Broner taunted Malignaggi repeatedly telling him, ""You can't hit me."" The pre fight was ugly and when the fight was over, they did not embrace in the ring. During the post fight interview, Broner started to show some respect, ""He's a world-class fighter, and I respect him. To come to somebody's hometown and beat them on a split decision, that's saying something. This was a tremendous win for me. I mean, who's doing it like me? Nobody."" He then went on to say, ""I came into town, and I got his belt and his girl."" Malignaggi claimed there was corruption and that Al Haymon had New York judge Tom Schreck (117–111) ""in his pocket"". He also threatened to quit boxing. He said, ""In my hometown, as the defending champion, I felt like I should have got it."" Broner earned a career-high $1.5 million compared to Malignaggi, who also earned a career-high $1.125 million purse.

Malignaggi vs. Judah 
Malignaggi then faced five-time champion and fellow Brooklyn native Zab Judah at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York on December 7, 2013. In the second round, after Judah connected with a hard left hand, Malignaggi went down but argued that it was a slip. Malignaggi got up and went to dominate the remainder of the fight en route to a unanimous decision victory.

Malignaggi vs. Porter 
Golden Boy announced on March 12, 2014 Shawn Porter would defend his newly won IBF world title on April 19, against Malignaggi on the undercard of Bernard Hopkins vs. Beibut Shumenov at the DC Armory in Washington. Porter entered as the # 6 welterweight contender in the world according to The Ring Magazine. Malignaggi was ranked as the # 8 contender. Porter won via 4th-round TKO. A double jab opened a cut under the left eye of Malignaggi in round one. Porter had a huge second round, badly rocking Malignaggi multiple times. In round four, Porter hurt Malignaggi with a lunging left hook moments later and a barrage, which included a couple of clean right hands which sent Malignaggi down and under the bottom rope. The referee waved an end to the bout without beginning a count. In the post fight, Porter said, ""The objective was to use the jab and get to the body, and it all worked. The first knockdown, he knew that right hand was going to come all night. [In the fourth round], it was a big right hand. He knew it would land all night. We kept throwing it."" Malignaggi was humble in defeat, ""He has potential to be great, and I told him to go be great I'm not sure what I'm going to do. I don't want to lose to an average champion. I want to lose to a great champion.If this is my last fight, I hope I lost to a great champion.""

Malignaggi vs. O' Connor cancellation
Malignaggi was scheduled to face Danny O'Connor on May 29, 2015 on the Amir Khan vs. Chris Algieri undercard when he was forced to withdraw due to a deep cut above his eye he suffered in training.

Malignaggi vs. Garcia 
Malignaggi took on Danny Garcia at Barclays Center, Brooklyn, August 1, 2015. It was Garcia's first step up to fight at 147 lbs. Malignaggi was cut above his right eye by the third and had a large welt beneath the right eye by the sixth. At the time of the stoppage, at the 2:22 mark of the ninth round, Malignaggi was absorbing a succession of blows as referee Arthur Mercante Jr. stepped in and wrapped his arms around him, signaling the end. Garcia was awarded a technical knockout.

Malignaggi vs. Fazekas, Moscatiello 
Following the loss to Garcia, Malignaggi wasted no time to return to the ring a month later, fighting in Italy for the first time in his career against little-known 25 year old Hungarian boxer Laszlo Fazekas. In front of a sold out crowd of 550, at the Teatro Principe in Milan, Malignaggi won on points after 8 rounds. The three judges had it 79–72, 80–71, and 80–71 for Malignaggi. Fazekas showed signs of dirty tactics and paid the price by being deducted a point in round 3 for hitting with inside of the glove.

Malignaggi returned to the boxing ring again in December against Italian boxer Antonio Moscatiello (20-2-1, 14 KOs) on the undercard of Anthony Joshua vs. Dillian Whyte at the O2 Arena in a 12-round scheduled fight for the vacant EBU welterweight title. Malignaggi was supposed to fight 47-year-old Gianluca Branco, however that fell apart after Branco reportedly pulled out of the fight. The fight went the full 12 rounds as Malignaggi claimed a wide points victory. The three judges scored the fight 119–110, 119–110, and 120–109.

Malignaggi vs. Bracero 
According to ESPN, reports stated Malignaggi would be fighting 35-year-old Gabriel Bracero (24-2, 5 KOs) on the undercard of the Leo Santa Cruz vs. Carl Frampton fight card on July 30 at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York. Malignaggi defended his 'King of Brooklyn' belt and local bragging rights. Using rapid footwork and moving in and out, Malignaggi won the first eight rounds as Bracero stood in front of him not moving or chasing or changing strategy. The final judges' scores were 96–94, 98–92, and 98–92. After the bout, Malignaggi returned to commentating at ringside.

Malignaggi vs. Eggington 
On January 25, 2017 it was announced that Malignaggi would travel to the UK to challenge 23 year old Sam Eggington (19-3, 11 KOs) for his WBC International welterweight title on the Haye-Bellew PPV undercard on March 4 at The O2 Arena. Referee Laughlin called it at 1 minute 50 seconds into round 8 with Eggington winning the fight by way of knockout. The fight came to an end when Eggington landed a body shot on Malignaggi causing him pain. This followed with a short right to the head. At the time of the stoppage, Malignaggi was ahead on two of the judges' scorecards. Malignaggi said he would be retiring with this being his last fight.

Retirement 
On March 6, 2017 Malignaggi officially announced his retirement from boxing at the age of 36, calling an end to his 16-year professional career. Malignaggi wrote on social media, ""Nineteen years ago today, I entered the ring for the first time as an amateur. That makes this as good a time as any to announce my retirement from competition."" He finished his career with 44 professional fights, winning 36, with 7 inside the distance and 8 losses.

Life after boxing 
In retirement, Malignaggi joined the Team McGregor camp following the announcement of Conor McGregor's August 26, 2017 boxing bout against undefeated Floyd Mayweather. A sparring session between Malignaggi and McGregor was rumored to have become violent, and photos were leaked showing Malignaggi appearing to have been knocked down. Malignaggi disputed the rumors and announced on Aug. 3, 2017 he would be leaving Team McGregor. He also called for the full video of the sparring session to be released to show what actually took place, claiming he was pushed and never knocked down during the 12 round session. He also claimed that in fact over the 12 rounds of sparring he had dominated Conor McGregor. On August 11, two short clips of the sparring session, including of the knockdown in question, were released by Dana White on Instagram. This footage showed McGregor as the aggressor and landing multiple shots against Malignaggi, who after the release continued to assert he had been pushed, citing McGregor's hand placement holding his neck down prior to swinging a left uppercut and pushing off with his right hand.

Malignaggi was part of the Showtime broadcast team, before being removed over race comments related to a former statement by boxer Devin Haney.

Bare knuckle boxing
On March 7, 2019, news surfaced that Malignaggi had signed an exclusive contract with Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship and he made his debut in June 2019 against Artem Lobov. Malignaggi has history with Lobov's training partner, Conor McGregor, and the bout between Lobov and Malignaggi was billed to be a ""grudge match"" and took place at BKFC 6 on June 22, 2019. Malignaggi stated  ""if I don’t hurt him to a degree that there’s something permanent there, it’s not a win for me”  and vowed to put Lobov in a coma hoping to bait Conor McGregor into a fight. Malignaggi lost the fight via unanimous decision. After the fight, he announced his retirement from fighting.

Acting and other media 
Malignaggi has featured in print clothing advertisements that have been published in magazines such as Esquire and Playboy. He also had a small role in the 2003 film Undefeated, and had a feature documentary on his life leading up his fight with Miguel Cotto, entitled Magic Man, which later aired on Showtime. Video game company Nintendo used Malignaggi to portray their character Little Mac in the live-action trailer for the 2009 game Punch-Out!! for the Wii. Also in 2009, he was a featured fighter in EA Sports' Fight Night Round 4. Malignaggi is currently an award-winning boxing commentator for Showtime, Fox Sports 1, and British network Sky Sports. In 2015, Malignaggi featured in the Blue Bloods episode ""Home Sweet Home"".

5208,"['socialism against argument best The "" saying as quoted being , capitalism U.S. and socialism Soviet between observations childhood her discussed publicly has She ?']","Marina Medvin is an American criminal defense attorney located in Alexandria, Virginia. She is also a senior columnist at Townhall, a former contributor at Forbes, and provides legal analysis to news outlets.

Education and career 
Medvin is a graduate of Pennsylvania State University (B.S., Information Sciences and Technology). She received her Juris Doctor from the Antonin Scalia Law School at George Mason University. She is licensed to practice state law in Virginia, the District of Columbia, and Texas; as well as federal law in most federal courts in Virginia, DC, and Texas. Medvin has been recognized by the Washingtonian as being one of Washington DC's Best Lawyers.

January 6 Capitol Cases 
Medvin is representing at least six known individuals charged in the 2021 storming of the United States Capitol.

Medvin’s client Jenny Cudd was granted a Mexican getaway during her pre-trial release. In Cudd's case, Medvin argued the District of Columbia was too partisan to have a fair jury and asked to move the case from DC to Texas. Medvin was the first lawyer representing a Capitol defendant to move for the trial to be relocated to another jurisdiction, though others later copied Medvin’s brief and made identical arguments. At sentencing for Jenny Cudd, Medvin argued that Cudd’s charges should be dismissed or that she should be sentenced to a fine, citing disparate treatment of the Kavanaugh, Portland, and Seattle protestors, where criminal charges were dismissed. Judge Trevor McFadden agreed and sentenced Jenny Cudd to a fine and two months of probation. Medvin then argued with the Government over whether Cudd should be permitted to possess her firearms during probation and prevailed.

In another Capitol breach case, Medvin represented a 61-year-old alleged Capitol rioter charged with assaulting Capitol Police officers, who she claimed would be proven innocent once a government released a video showing John Anderson did not commit the alleged acts. Court records show Medvin berating the government's control of information about the January 6 defendants: “This is not the Soviet Union, and the government does not get to control the narrative of what happens in the courtroom. The weedlike growth of the government’s power over public information is outrageous and un-American and cannot be permitted to continue unchecked.” Anderson passed away in September 2021 before his trial. Medvin later explained that Anderson never entered the Capitol on his own, having been brought inside for medical care, and that he never hurt or impeded any officers, contrary to the government's accusations. Medvin appeared on Sebastian Gorka's show in April 2022 and stated that Anderson was brought into the Capitol building by Capitol police who rendered medical aid to Anderson after he experienced a medical emergency when he was gassed by a malicious actor in the crowd behind him. Anderson repeatedly said, ""I can't breathe, I can't breathe."" The man who emptied a gas canister into Anderson was never charged, according to Medvin.

Medvin is also representing two US Marines charged for their participation in the January 6 incident, one an alleged Proud Boys member. Her client Christopher Warnagiris, the only active-duty servicemember charged for January 6 participation, pleaded not guilty to assaulting or interfering with a Capitol police officer. Warnagiris, like Medvin's client Jenny Cudd, also received permission from the court to continue possessing his firearms.

Medvin's Prior Cases of Note 
Medvin previously represented an FBI 10 Most Wanted fugitive, a hacktivist in the Anonymous Operation Payback case, and a student who hacked CIA Director John Brennan and published with WikiLeaks.

Early life and political views 
Marina Medvin emigrated from the USSR in 1992. She has publicly discussed her childhood observations between Soviet socialism and U.S. capitalism, being quoted as saying ""The best argument against socialism? Me."" Politico described Medvin as a ""conservative firebrand.""

5210,"['me with dance to like you Would "" , Lillian ask to Sortwell prompting , Daniels Miss to dance next the promised he that Lillian tells David ?']","Here I Am a Stranger is a 1939 American drama film directed by Roy Del Ruth and written by Sam Hellman and Milton Sperling. The film stars Richard Greene and Richard Dix as son and father. It was based on the short story of the same name by Gordon Malherbe Hillman. The film was released on September 28, 1939, by 20th Century Fox.

Plot

Clara leaves her husband Duke for the sake of their son David
""New York City 1920"". Anxiously sitting by the crib of her year-old son David, Clara hears a knock and a voice threatening to return ""with a dispossess notice and a cop"". As she starts packing a suitcase, her drunken husband Duke Allen comes home with a bouquet and a birthday rattle for David. He tells her that he quit his job and she tells him that she loves him, but has to leave him and go back home for David's sake.

David is planning to marry into the wealthy Bennett family
A card displays, ""Love to David on his twentieth birthday from Mother & Dad"", as David listens to ""Happy Birthday"" sung by Clara, her husband and David's adoptive father, prominent attorney James K. Paulding, R. J. Bennett's snobbish and immoral son Lester and daughter Lillian, with whom David has developed a personal relationship. R. J. himself, a wealthy businessman who employs Paulding, arrives late and immediately starts discussing business before giving David an expensive watch as a birthday and going-away-to-college present.

David goes to college and meets Duke again
At Stafford University, where Duke and Clara were once students, Lester is showing David the campus. They pass by the house of English professor Daniels and run into his beautiful daughter Simpson who has auto oil on her face while repairing her car. In Daniels' class, Davis is seated next to working class student Sortwell who was raised on a farm and works as a laundry deliveryman, but hopes to be an architect.

Daniels invites David and Sortwell to his home for a Saturday literary session and learns from David that his father was Duke Allen, a football hero and one of Daniels' earliest and most favorite students. He gives David a copy of a student publication from his father's era which contains one of Duke's most brilliant essays. David reads it and returns to Daniels' house where Simpson helps him to find his father's address in Boston.

David goes to visit Duke and finds him sleeping in a drunken stupor. However, upon seeing David, Duke quickly revives and steps into the shower. In the meantime, David finds a scrapbook of newspaper clippings from the social pages, indicating that his Duke has kept track of his son's progress. Father and son go out to have lunch at the local cafeteria where Duke is greeted by various locals. Duke is vague about his current employment, but invites David to join him in watching a college football game on Saturday.

As David returns to the campus, Clara comes to see him and he tells her about visiting Duke. Clara responds that the past is best left alone. On Saturday, at the game, Duke is enthusiastic, but David is reticent and barely greets Sortwell who passes by. By the time they return to Duke's lodgings, however, they are singing the team song. Duke finds a telegram from David declining to come and David confesses that he initially took Clara's advice, but then changed his mind. The next day, Duke visits the managing editor of the paper for which he used to write and asks to return because ""you see, I got a family now"".

David falls in love with Professor Daniels' daughter Simpson
At Thanksgiving, David visits Professor Daniels and watches Simpson count off dance steps for Sortwell who is trying to learn steps while holding a pillow. She then puts on a dance record and demonstrates a fast dance with David. With Sortwell still reluctant, David puts ""Sweet Georgia Brown"" on, grabs Sortwell and dances with him, spurring Simpson to run to her father's bedroom and inform him that she was breaking her habit of not attending college dances and intends to attend this one with him as her escort.

At the dance, David is partnered with Lillian who tells about a Yale boy who invited her to Hawaii. Sortwell can find no one to dance with him until Simpson arrives and takes him onto the dance floor, counting off their steps. At the end of one dance, they stop next to 
David and Lillian and, when Sortwell mentions his rented tuxedo, Lillian responds with a snobbish comment about Simpson's dress. David tells Lillian that he promised the next dance to Miss Daniels, prompting Sortwell to ask Lillian, ""Would you like to dance with me?"", to which she responds, ""I would not"" and walks away. During the dance, David apologizes to Simpson about Lillian's remarks, while Lester and another collegian trick tee-totaling Sortwell into drinking alcohol by telling him that it is simply punch.

David and Simpson go outside and when she makes self-deprecating remarks and unpins her hair, he tells her, ""you're really wonderful"", but as he moves to kiss her, she says, ""can you imagine it, I'm shy"". In the meantime, Sortwell has been drinking punch with Lester and two other collegians and has become inebriated. David leads him away from the punchbowl to his laundry delivery truck and watches him drive away. Lester, who is also drunk, pulls David into the passenger seat of his car and starts to drive at high speed while complaining that with David's constant trips to Boston, he never gets to see him anymore and that he is spending too much time with people such as Sortwell and Simpson.

Lester Bennett drives drunk and commits vehicular homicide
When David tells him that he's drunk, Lester starts to drive faster and hits a woman passerby. David tells him to stop, but Lester continues onward as Sortwell's laundry truck stops next to the fallen woman. Later that night, David walks into Duke's newsroom, but is too distraught to react to Duke's announcement that he is now the night editor of the Boston Tribune. He tells Duke what happened as Duke receives a call from one of his reporters that the woman is dead and Sortwell has been arrested as the guilty driver. Duke tells him that they will go to his lodgings together and decide what to do in the morning.

The following morning, Lester, his father, their lawyer Evans, Clara and Paulding are discussing the accident and whether David informed the police that Lester was the guilty driver. David arrives and, upon assuring them that he did not call the police, is pressured by Bennett and Evans that he should allow Sortwell to take the blame and save the family from an ""unpleasant experience"". David is outraged by such a suggestion prompting Bennett to threaten him with financial repercussions. Paulding says, ""Don't talk to the boy like that"" and takes David to his office where he explains that he married his mother when she was in difficult straits and did everything to provide for her and David and now expects David to repay him by remaining silent, otherwise the powerful and influential Bennett would crush him.

David stands on his principles and refuses to protect Lester
David, however, refuses to change his mind. Upon hearing that, Bennett says, ""Evans, call the chief of police on the phone, tell him Lester's giving himself up... make it sound good... the boy's conscience bothers him... he doesn't want the other kid to take the blame for him... it'll swing public sympathy our way..."" Clara then goes to her husband's office and tells David that she made all the sacrifices for him and now it's his turn to be grateful. David rejects that argument and tells her that he is going to stay with his real father. As soon as he leaves, Clara picks up the phone and calls Boston.

David waits at his father's lodgings and when Duke arrives he tells David that Clara and Paulding visited and offered him ten thousand dollars to go to South America and he jumped at the opportunity to leave his low-paying newspaper job and take a long trip. Deeply disappointed and disillusioned, David says goodbye and leaves. No longer employed by Bennett, Paulding is returning to his native England and Clara is coming with him. Having lost everything too, David is leaving with them and comes to say goodbye to Professor Daniels and Simpson. Sortwell is honking from his laundry truck, ready to take David to the train station, as he hugs and kisses Simpson who goes to her father's study and cries on his shoulder.

David returns to see Duke
A day before departure, Clara sees how desperately unhappy David is and tells him that she left Duke even though she loved him and that she married Paulding so that David would have happiness and now she will tell David the truth so that he will be happy — there was no monetary offer to Duke and he is not going to South America, implying that she may not be joining Paulding on his return to England. A newspaper office boy tells Duke that a man is outside to see him... a man who says he is his son. Duke stands up and begins walking with an ever-growing expression of happiness on his face.

5363,"['See "" , wife his to says he , cart the in Back ?']","""The Idiots"" is a short story by Joseph Conrad, his first to be published. It first appeared in The Savoy in 1896. The story was included in the Conrad collection Tales of Unrest, published in 1898.

Set in Brittany, the story describes a couple whose children have intellectual disability; the strain on the family leads eventually to murder.

Background
The story was written during Joseph Conrad's honeymoon; he rented a house on Île-Grande, on the north coast of Brittany, from April to August 1896. His wife Jessie later wrote that ""much of our Île-Grande life is in that short story.... The stone-cutters are in it, our landlady is in it, and the feeling of our surroundings, perhaps a little more sombrely than the reality"", and explained how the story originated: while being driven from Lannion to Île-Grande, the driver pointed out ""the idiots"", saying ""Four - hein. And all in the same family. That's a little too much. And the priests say it's God's will!""

Conrad had a poor opinion of this story, writing that it was ""an obviously derivative piece of work""; he did not name a model, but critics have supposed that it was influenced by Guy de Maupassant.

Story summary
The reader is introduced to ""the idiots"" as the narrator is driven near Ploumar in Brittany and they are pointed out on the road by the driver.

The earlier story of the family follows. Jean-Pierre Bacadou, returning from military service, finds his elderly father's farm is in a poor state, and resolves to make improvements. He marries Susan; the celebration of the event at the farm is picturesquely described.

Twins are born; Jean-Pierre notices something is wrong. His wife says, dully, ""When they sleep they are like other people's children."" A third child is born. ""That child, like the other two, never smiled, never stretched its hand to her, never spoke...""

The parish priest calls on the local landowner, the Marquis de Chavanes, to say that Jean-Pierre Bacadou, a republican, has attended Mass, an unheard-of event. The Marquis, a royalist and former mayor, thinks this is significant, and thinks he will win the next communal election, since he regards Jean-Pierre as influential.

A girl is born to the couple; she is like their other children. One evening, driving through Ploumar, Jean-Pierre stops and walks up to the churchyard gates and calls, ""Hey there! Come out!"" Back in the cart, he says to his wife, ""See? Nobody. I've been made a fool."" In the autumn he angrily wanders about the fields, aware that there is no one to take over the farm.

Susan's mother, Madame Levaille, is a businesswoman who has a local granite quarry and a shop.

Jean-Pierre angrily approaches Susan, and she kills him with scissors. After telling her mother, who is appalled by her daughter's actions, she goes down to the beach, delirious. One of the seaweed-gatherers there approaches to help her, but she thinks it is Jean-Pierre's ghost. Trying to escape from him, she eventually falls from a cliff and dies.

The Marquis de Chavanes makes arrangements to have Madame Levaille made guardian of the children and administrator of the farm, rather than a member of the republican Bacadous.

5414,"['Kombat Mortal it name you n\'t do Why "" , him to said and "" Kombat "" word the saw , office \'s Boon in sitting was Ritchie Steve designer Pinball ?']","Mortal Kombat is an arcade fighting game developed and published by Midway in 1992. It is the first entry in the Mortal Kombat series and subsequently was released by Acclaim Entertainment for nearly every home platform of the time. The game focuses on several characters of various intentions who enter a martial arts tournament with worldly consequences. It introduced many key aspects of the Mortal Kombat series, including the unique five-button control scheme and gory finishing moves called Fatalities.

Mortal Kombat is considered one of the greatest video games of all time by critics and audiences in 21st century and became a best-selling game and remains one of the most popular fighting games in the genre's history, spawning numerous sequels and spin-offs over the following years and decades, beginning with Mortal Kombat II in 1993, which is also considered one of the greatest video games of all time. Both games were the subject of a successful film adaptation in 1995. However, it also sparked much controversy for its depiction of extreme violence and gore using realistic digitized graphics, and, along with the home release of Night Trap, prompted the formation of the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB), a U.S. government-backed organization that set descriptor ratings for video games.

Gameplay

Mortal Kombat is a fighting game in which players battle opponents in one-on-one matches. The fighter that completely drains the opponent's health bar first wins the round, and the first to win two rounds wins the match. Each round is timed; if both fighters still have health remaining when time runs out, the one with more health wins the round. Two players can start a game together, or a second player can join in during a single player's game to fight against them. If a game was in progress at the time, the winner continues it alone; if not, the winner begins a new game.

Mortal Kombat uses an eight-directional joystick and five buttons, including two punch and two kick buttons, each further differentiated between high and low. Attacks can vary depending on the player's distance from the opponent. All player characters have a shared set of attacks performed by holding the joystick in various directions, such as a leg sweep and an uppercut; the latter attack knocks the enemy high into the air and causes a large amount of damage. Most special moves were performed by tapping the joystick, sometimes ending with a button press. Unlike previous one-on-one fighting games, few moves require circular joystick movement. The game's blocking system also distinguished itself from other fighting games, as characters take a small amount of damage from regular moves while blocking. However, the dedicated block button allows users to defend against attacks without retreating and blocking characters lose very little ground when struck, thus making counterattacks much easier after a successful block.

Mortal Kombat further introduced the concept of ""juggling"", knocking an opponent into the air and following up with a combination of attacks while the enemy is still airborne and defenseless. The idea became so popular that it has spread to many other games. Another of the game's innovations was the Fatality, a finishing move performed against a defeated opponent to execute them in a gruesome fashion.

In the single-player game, the player faces each of the seven playable characters in a series of one-on-one matches against computer-controlled opponents, ending in a ""Mirror Match"" against a duplicate of the player's chosen character. The player must then fight in three endurance matches, each of which involves two opponents. As soon as the player defeats the first opponent, the second one enters the arena and the timer resets; however, the player's health meter does not regenerate. After the third endurance match, the player fights the sub-boss Goro, followed by a final match against Shang Tsung.

Between certain levels, players can compete in a minigame called ""Test Your Might"" for bonus points, breaking blocks of various materials by filling a meter past a certain point through rapid button presses. The first material the player must break is wood, followed by stone, steel, ruby, and finally diamond, with each successive material requiring more of the meter to be filled up and thus awarding more points. Two players can compete in the minigame at once and the last two materials are only accessible through two-player mode. The minigame would return in various forms in Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance, Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks, Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe, Mortal Kombat: Komplete Edition, Mortal Kombat X, and its DLC counterpart, Mortal Kombat XL.

Plot

The game takes place in Earthrealm, where a tournament is being held on Shang Tsung's Island, on which seven of its locations serve as stages in the game. The introduction to Mortal Kombat explains that Shang Tsung was banished to Earthrealm 500 years previously and, with the help of the monstrous Goro, is able to seize control of the Mortal Kombat tournament in an attempt to doom the realm. For 500 years straight, Goro has been undefeated in the tournament, and won nine consecutive tournaments. If Goro wins again, Shao Kahn, Emperor of Outworld, will be allowed to take Earthrealm. In order to prevent this, a new generation of warriors must challenge Goro. The player receives information about the characters in biographies displayed during the attract mode. The bulk of the game's backstory and lore was only told in a comic book, but some additional information about the characters and their motivations for entering the tournament is received upon completion of the game with each character.

Characters

Mortal Kombat includes 7 playable characters, each with their own unique Fatality and all of whom would eventually become trademark characters and appear in several sequels. The game was developed with digitized sprites based on real actors.

Ho-Sung Pak plays Liu Kang, a former member of the White Lotus society who enters the tournament representing the Shaolin temples. Elizabeth Malecki plays the Special Forces agent, Sonya Blade, who enters in pursuit of a dangerous criminal from the Black Dragon organization, Kano, played by Richard Divizio. Carlos Pesina plays Raiden (spelled ""Rayden"" in the MS-DOS and console ports), a thunder god who competes in the tournament as a mortal, while Daniel Pesina, Carlos' brother, plays the Hollywood movie star Johnny Cage and the undead spectre Scorpion, a ninja who was murdered prior to the events of the tournament and brought back to life to avenge his own death. The yellow color of Scorpion's outfit was changed to blue to create his rival and murderer Sub-Zero, a member of the Lin Kuei clan of assassins who has the power to generate ice. Mortal Kombat would become famous for such palette swaps that would continue to be used in later games as the technique to create new characters.

The four-armed Shokan warrior, Goro serves as the sub-boss of the game; being a half-human, half-dragon beast, he is much stronger than the other characters and cannot be affected by throw attacks. The character's sprites are based on a stop motion model which was created by Curt Chiarelli. Shang Tsung, the game's main antagonist and final boss (who was played by two actors, Eric Kincade and Ho-Sung Pak, although only the latter is credited in the actual game) is a sorcerer who can transform into any playable character in the game at any time during a battle.

When fighting on the Pit stage, the player could qualify to fight the secret character, Reptile, a green-clad palette swap of Scorpion and Sub-Zero who uses both characters' moves, by meeting a special set of conditions. Goro, Shang Tsung, and Reptile were non-playable characters. The Masked Guard in the Courtyard stage was portrayed by Mortal Kombat developer John Vogel.

Development
Mortal Kombat creators Ed Boon and John Tobias have stated that Midway Games tasked them with the project of developing a ""combat game for release within a year"", which the two believed was intended to compete with the popular Street Fighter II: The World Warrior. According to Tobias, he and Boon had envisioned a fighting game similar to Data East's Karate Champ but featuring large digitized characters even before that, and the success of Capcom's Street Fighter II only helped them convince the management of their idea. Boon said the development team initially consisted of four people — himself as programmer, artists John Tobias and John Vogel, and Dan Forden as sound designer. The game's budget was around $1 million.

According to Richard Divizio and Daniel Pesina, Mortal Kombat had actually begun when Tobias along with Divizio and the brothers Daniel and Carlos Pesina planned to create a ninja-themed fighting game, however this idea was rejected by Midway's entire management. Instead, Midway sought to make an action game based on the upcoming movie Universal Soldier and featuring a digitized version of martial arts film star Jean-Claude Van Damme, but he was already in negotiations with another company for a video game that ultimately was never released. Divizio then convinced Tobias to return to their original project. In the end, Van Damme was parodied in the game in the form of Johnny Cage (with whom he shares his name's initials, JC), a narcissistic Hollywood movie star who performs a split punch to the groin in a nod to a scene from Bloodsport. Tobias credited other inspirations as having come from the Asian martial arts cinema.

Boon later said, ""since the beginning, one of the things that's separated us from other fighting games is the crazy moves we've put in it, like fireballs and all the magic moves, so to speak."" According to Tobias, the game's ultraviolent content had not been originally intended and was only implemented gradually as the development progressed. The concept of Fatalities in particular evolved from the ""dizzied"" mechanic in earlier fighting games. Boon said that he hated the ""dizzied"" mechanic, but that it was fun to have one's opponent get dizzied and get in a free hit. Boon and Tobias decided they could eliminate the aggravation of getting dizzied by having it occur at the end of the fight, after the outcome had already been decided. An early version of the game used two more buttons for middle punch and kick attacks.

Mortal Kombat was reportedly developed in 10 months from 1991 to 1992, with a test version seeing limited release halfway through the development cycle. As a demo version of the game, which featured only six characters (all male), became internally popular within Midway offices, the team was given more time to work on it, resulting in the addition of Sonya to the roster. Footage for the game's digitized characters was filmed with Tobias' personal Hi-8 camcorder. The final arcade game used eight megabytes of graphics data, with each character having 64 colors and around 300 frames of animation.

The team had difficulty settling on a name for the game. Ed Boon has stated that for six months during development ""nobody could come up with a name nobody didn't hate."" Some of the names suggested were Kumite, Dragon Attack, Death Blow and Fatality. One day, someone had written down ""combat"" on the drawing board for the names in Boon's office and someone wrote a K over the C, according to Boon, ""just to be kind of weird."" Pinball designer Steve Ritchie was sitting in Boon's office, saw the word ""Kombat"" and said to him, ""Why don't you name it Mortal Kombat?"", a name that Boon stated ""just stuck."" John Tobias recalled this a bit differently, saying it ""came about during the trademark process in naming the game. We really liked Mortal Combat as a name, but it couldn't get past legal."" Since then, the series has begun frequently using the letter K in place of the letter C when it has the hard C sound.

Release

Although the arcade version of Mortal Kombat was never localized in Japan, it still had an official release there in 1992 by Taito, who published North American imports of Midway's game.

The launch of Mortal Kombat for home consoles by Acclaim Entertainment was one of the largest video game launches of the time. A flood of TV commercials heralded the simultaneous release of all four home versions of the game, SNES, Genesis, Game Boy and Game Gear,  on September 13, 1993, a date dubbed ""Mortal Monday"". In the same year, an official comic book, Mortal Kombat Collector's Edition, was written and illustrated by the game's designer artist John Tobias and made available through mail order, describing the backstory of the game in greater detail. The comic was advertised during the game's attract mode and would later be sold normally around the country, although it was quite difficult to get a copy outside of the United States. The comic was also later included as a series of unlockable bonuses in Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance.

Mortal Kombat: The Album, an album by The Immortals featuring techno music, was released in May 1994. It features two themes for the game, ""Techno Syndrome"" and ""Hypnotic House"", as well as themes written for each character. ""Techno Syndrome"" was adapted for the 1995 movie soundtrack and incorporated the familiar ""Mortal Kombat!"" yell from the Mortal Monday commercials. Jeff Rovin also penned a novelization of the first Mortal Kombat game, which was published in June 1995 in order to coincide with the release of the first movie. There were also lines of action figures based on the game's characters.

Home versions

Four official ports were released in North America as part of the ""Mortal Monday"" campaign in 1993: home console ports for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) and Sega Genesis, and handheld console ports for the Game Boy and Game Gear. While the SNES version's visuals and audio were more arcade accurate than those of the Genesis version, it has less precise controls and due to Nintendo's ""family friendly"" policies, replaces the blood with sweat and most of the Fatalities with less violent ""finishing moves"". The sweat effect, which was a palette coloration added after Nintendo's decision to censor the game, could be reverted to the original red blood color via a Game Genie code input as ""BDB4-DD07"". On the Genesis version, the blood and uncensored Fatalities were available via a cheat code, spelled out ""ABACABB"", a nod to the Abacab album by the band Genesis, who shared their name with the North American version of the console. This version was given an MA-13 rating by the Videogame Rating Council.

The Game Boy version was largely cut down from its arcade counterpart. It had laggy controls and a limited button layout. It also omitted Johnny Cage, Reptile and the bloodier Fatality moves. However, players could play as Goro via a code. Johnny Cage was apparently intended to be a playable character, but was cut out; bits of his character data remain in the data files. The Game Gear version was similar to the Game Boy version, but with major improvements (color, faster gameplay, and tighter controls). Like its 16-bit counterpart, the game was censored unless a cheat code (2, 1, 2, Down, Up) had been entered, but lacked Kano and Reptile. A Master System port based on the Game Gear version was released for PAL regions in early 1994. According to Phylene Riggs of Acclaim, an NES port was also planned at one point, but cancelled before it entered the programming stage.

A port for MS-DOS was released in late 1993. The DOS version is the most accurate port of the arcade version in terms of graphics and gameplay. It was first released on floppy disk and later re-released on CD-ROM, with that release upgraded with the original arcade music and sound effects. An Amiga version was released in early 1994 in Europe only, with graphics based on the Genesis version, controls limited to either one or two action buttons, and a minimal soundtrack with music arranged by Allister Brimble.

The Sega CD version of the game was released featuring a video intro of the Mortal Monday commercial. This port did not require a code to be entered to access the uncensored content and thus was given an MA-17 rating. While this port was technologically inferior to the better-looking SNES port and had loading times, it resembled the arcade version more faithfully in actual gameplay. It also featured the authentic CD-DA soundtrack, taken directly from the arcade version, but some of the arenas feature the wrong music (such as Courtyard playing the Pit's theme). Several remixes of the Mortal Kombat theme music were included as bonus features, including the remix used later for the film adaptation. Some copies of this version are incompatible with model 1.1 of the Sega CD; Acclaim offered to replace any such discs that were mailed to their Oyster Bay headquarters with working copies.

Mortal Kombat was later released in Japan for the Game Gear, Super Famicom, Game Boy and Mega Drive as  and for the Mega-CD as  with no major changes from their first release.

A conversion of the game was being developed by Iguana Entertainment and scheduled to be published on the Atari Jaguar, but it was never released.

In 2004, Jakks Pacific released the game as one of its Plug It in & Play TV Games, developed by Digital Eclipse. It is a unique port made directly from the arcade code by Chris Burke, who was the sole programmer on the port. Due to hardware limitations from the uncommon processor used by the Jakks Pacific units, the backgrounds are static and feature no parallax scrolling. Both censored and uncensored versions were released, rated T for Teen and M for Mature respectively.

Also in 2004, the premium edition of Mortal Kombat: Deception on the PlayStation 2 and original Xbox included the game as bonus content played via emulation of the original arcade code. While it was promoted as ""arcade perfect"", there were some emulation issues with the sound and gameplay.

The game was also a part of the 2005 compilation Midway Arcade Treasures: Extended Play. Like the Mortal Kombat: Deception release, it has sound issues. On August 31, 2011, Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment released Mortal Kombat Arcade Kollection, consisting of Mortal Kombat, Mortal Kombat II and Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, as a downloadable title for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360.

Reception
In the United States, RePlay reported Mortal Kombat to be the second most-popular upright arcade cabinet in September 1992. It then topped the RePlay upright arcade cabinet charts from October to November 1992, then from February to March 1993, and then in November 1993. It also topped the Play Meter arcade chart in December 1992. It was the second top-grossing arcade game of Summer 1993, below NBA Jam, according to RePlay. It was one of America's top two highest-grossing arcade games of 1993 (along with NBA Jam), exceeding the  domestic box office gross of the film Jurassic Park the same year. It also topped the Sega CD sales chart in June 1994.

In November 1993, Acclaim announced that they had shipped more than three million copies of Mortal Kombat for home systems, counting the SNES, Genesis, Game Boy and Game Gear versions combined. The game sold  copies worldwide in its first three weeks of release. In the United States, it was the top-selling Sega Genesis and SNES game in January 1994.  In the United Kingdom, it was the top-selling home video game in October 1993, the top-selling Sega Master System game for four months in 1994 (from May to August), and the top-selling Mega CD game in June 1994.

By July 1994, the home cartridge versions had sold more than  units worldwide and grossed over  in sales revenue. , it has sold  cartridges worldwide across all platforms, with the Genesis version accounting for the majority of sales. , the original arcade version has sold 24,000 arcade units and grossed an estimated . The game also generated licensing fees from films and TV shows, bringing total game and licensing revenue to  .

Reviews

The arcade game received mixed reviews upon release from Computer and Video Games and Sinclair User. The digitized sprite graphics were praised and compared favorably with Pit-Fighter, but the gameplay was compared unfavorably with Street Fighter II and Fatal Fury 2.

Upon release on home systems, the game received generally positive reviews. GamePro hailed the SNES port of Mortal Kombat as having graphics closer to the arcade version than the other three initial home ports, with cleaner definition and a better color palette, and said that while four of the fatalities had been cut, the new finishing moves which replace them ""are pretty cool, though not as bloody."" Comparing it to the Genesis version, they found that the controls are less responsive but the sound is better due to the higher quality and inclusion of the announcer's voice. They concluded, ""Despite some control glitches and the altered Fatality Moves, Mortal Kombat for the SNES is a great representation of an arcade classic that will more than satisfy most gamers."" However, the Nintendo version’s widely reported censorship of blood and dismemberments affected sales, and was widely criticized by gaming media for censorship issues  into the following decades. In 2006, IGN named it as the eighth worst arcade-to-console conversion. Nintendo's decision to make the game more family-friendly was also included on GameSpy's list of the dumbest moments in gaming. Reviewing the Super NES release, Nintendo Power praised the games graphics, animation and sound as ""excellent"" while noting that four of the finishing moves are not identical to the arcade game. The review criticized the game as ""pretty easy unless you set the difficulty to hard.""

GamePros review of the Genesis port echoed the comparisons mentioned in their SNES review, but noted that while all the arcade version fatalities are included in ""Mode A"", they are noticeably cruder in appearance. They also criticized the fact that the port was developed for the three-button controller, saying this makes some moves awkward to pull off, but concluded, ""Great graphics, sound, and control in combination with the special Mode A setting make the Genesis Mortal Kombat a beat-em-up force.""

Highly praising the graphical detail and sharpness, as well as the bloody action when the violence code is enabled, GamePro declared the Game Gear version to be ""everything its 16-bit big brother is, plus it's portable."" They noted that the audio is fairly basic and, as with all four initial home ports, it has issues with the controls, but considered it an overall impressive achievement for a portable system.

Bill Kunkel wrote in Electronic Games that both Genesis and Super NES ports of the game as ""superb, first-rate conversions"" noting that the SNES edition graphically was better than the Sega Genesis version while noting that ""the characters, while they don't move quite as quickly as their Genesis counterparts, are magnificently animated."" Kunkel noted the exception of the character Goro who ""suffers from comparatively crude animation"".  Kunkel noted the difficulty in pulling off the moves in the game, finding that some players will ""be frustrated by the awkwardness of the commands"" and that ""those unfamiliar with the game will frequently find themselves accidentally discharging specialty moves while attempting a simple spin kick or other stunt.""

Reviewing the Game Boy version, GamePro commented, ""If you think the moves on the other systems are hard to execute, wait until you try to pull a move on the Game Boy. The unresponsive two-button controls are almost impossible to master. The game play is also abysmally slow, and the fighters don't always connect, even when they're close to an opponent."" Additionally bemoaning the difficult-to-discern graphics, weak animation, and minimal sound, they deemed it the worst version of the game. Reviewing the Game Boy version of the game, Nintendo Power stated that the graphic have been simplified but that ""the essence of the Super NES and arcade games have been well-preserved"" while noting that ""the animation, not surprisingly, is considerably slower than the Super NES.""

The Sega CD version was even more harshly criticized by gaming media. The reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly described it as over-hyped with only minor improvements over the Genesis version, and complained of the lag times. GamePro similarly commented ""The original Mortal Kombat is back, this time on CD, and you'd think there'd be some improvements. Think again."" They criticized that the load times between fights and lag times during fights ""give the game a quirky, out-of-touch feel.""

Accolades
Electronic Gaming Monthly awarded Mortal Kombat the title of ""Most Controversial Game of 1993"". In 1995, the Daily News wrote, ""the original Mortal Kombat video game debuted in 1992. Its combination of story line, character and mega-violence soon made it a hit worldwide. And the controversy engendered by its blood-gushing special effects only served to boost its popularity."" In 1996, GamesMaster listed the arcade version 81st in their ""Top 100 Games of All Time."" In 1995, Flux magazine rated the arcade version 5th on its ""Top 100 Video Games.""  They praised the digitized graphics, storyline, gameplay and characters. In 2004, readers of Retro Gamer voted Mortal Kombat as the 55th top retro game, with the staff commenting that ""future versions would address the limitations of the first game, but this is where it all began."" CraveOnline ranked it second of the top ten 2D fighters of all time, and Forbes called Mortal Kombat one of the ""most loved arcade games"" that was ""king of the arcade"" in its day, writing that the arcade machines of the original title sell for any price between a few hundred dollars to $2,500. In 2011, Complex ranked the first Mortal Kombat as the 12th best fighting game of all time, while Wirtualna Polska ranked it as the 19th best Amiga game. In 2012, Time named it one of the 100 greatest video games of all time. In 2013, the first Mortal Kombat was ranked as the best arcade game of the 1990s by Complex (the sequel, which ""took everything we loved about the original and magnified it by about a million,"" was given sixth place on the list). In 2019, The Strong National Museum of Play inducted Mortal Kombat to its World Video Game Hall of Fame.

Controversy

Mortal Kombat was one of many violent video games that came into prominence between 1992 and 1993, generating controversy among parents and public officials. Hearings on video game violence and the corruption of society, headed by Senators Joseph Lieberman and Herb Kohl, were held in late 1992 to 1993. The legislators were especially concerned with the realistic replica of human figures in games, such as Mortal Kombat, Night Trap, Doom and Lethal Enforcers, as opposed to cartoonish characters in other violent games such as Eternal Champions or Time Killers. The result of the hearings was that the entertainment software industry was given one year to form a working rating system or the federal government would intervene and create its own system. Eventually, the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) was conceived, requiring all video games to be rated and for these ratings to be placed on the games' packaging.

5451,"['Geltungsgrund als Entcharismatisierung "" , Anne , Müller ?']","Gilbert of Sempringham (c. 1085 – 4 February 1189) the founder of the Gilbertine Order, was the only Medieval Englishman to found a conventual order, mainly because the Abbot of Cîteaux declined his request to assist him in organising a group of women who wanted to live as nuns, living with lay brothers and sisters, in 1148. He founded a double monastery of canons regular and nuns in spite of such a foundation being contrary to canonical practice.

Life
Gilbert was born at Sempringham, near Bourne in Lincolnshire, the son of Jocelin, an Anglo-Norman lord of the manor, and an unnamed Anglo-Saxon mother. He had a brother, Roger, and a sister, Agnes.

Unusually for that period, his father actively prevented his son from becoming a knight, instead sending him to  France, probably the University of Paris but possibly under Anselm of Laon, to study theology. Some physical deformity may have made him unfit for military service, making an ecclesiastical career the best option. When he returned in 1120 he became a clerk in the household of Robert Bloet, Bishop of Lincoln, started a school for boys and girls (the existing primary school at Pointon is still named after him) and was ordained by Robert's successor, Alexander. Offered the archdeaconry of Lincoln, he refused, saying that he knew no surer way to perdition.

In the period 1115-1123 he was given both the vacant churches of Sempringham and West Torrington, near Wragby, by his father, Jocelin. In 1129 he became the Vicar of both St Andrew's, Sempringham and St Mary's, West Torrington having been instituted by Robert Bloet, Bishop of Lincoln.

""Gilbert was a lover of truth and justice, chastity and sobriety, and a diligent cultivator of the other virtues: wherefore he was revered and praised by all and obtained their favour and regard. Even Jocelin now rejoiced in the goodness of his son, he began to cherish him with fatherly affection, and ministered to his needs out of his own riches. Gilbert would be in his late twenties when his father presented him to the vacant churches of Sempringham and West Torrington, which he had built on his own demesne 'in the custom of his country' ""

The Gilbertines

When his father died in 1130, Gilbert became lord of the manor of Sempringham and West Torrington. In 1131 he founded the Gilbertine Order, and with the help of Alexander constructed at Sempringham a dwelling and cloister for nuns, at the north of the church of St Andrew. Eventually he had a chain of twenty-six convents, monasteries and missions. A custom developed in the houses of the order called ""the plate of the Lord Jesus"", whereby the best portions of the dinner were put on a special plate and shared with the poor. In 1148 he approached the Cistercians for help. They refused because he included women in his order. The male part of the order consisted of Canons Regular.

In 1165 Gilbert was charged with having aided Thomas Becket when Thomas fled from King Henry II after the council of Northampton, but he was eventually found innocent. In 1174 some of his lay brothers revolted, but he received the backing of Pope Alexander III. Gilbert resigned his office late in life because of blindness and died at Sempringham in about 1190, at the claimed age of 106.

The only religious order of English origin founded during the Middle Ages, it thrived until the Dissolution of the Monasteries under King Henry VIII.

Veneration

Gilbert was canonised in 1202 by Pope Innocent III. His liturgical feast day is on 4 February, commemorating his death, as it remains also in the Church of England (commemoration). According to the order of Hubert Walter, the bishops of England celebrated his feast, and his name was added to the wall of the church of the Four Crowned Martyrs. His Order did not outlast the English Reformation, however; and despite being influenced by Continental models, it did not maintain a foothold in Europe. There are, however, at least three primary schools in England named after him: in Pointon, Stamford, Lincolnshire and Winton, Greater Manchester.

5473,"['Allah of decree the at amazed you Are "" , said They : verse the in house the of people the , meaning ) Bayt - Al Ahl ( term the using her addressed Angels the since , Sarah , wife His ?']","Abraham is known as the patriarch of the Israelite people through Isaac, the son born to him and Sarah in their old age and the patriarch of Arabs through his son Ishmael, born to Abraham and Hagar, Sarah's Egyptian servant.

Although Abraham's forefathers were from southern Mesopotamia (in present-day Iraq) according to the biblical narrative, Yahweh led Abraham on a journey to the land of Canaan, which he promised to his children.

Source criticism
The genealogy of Abraham appears in Genesis 5, Genesis 10:1-7, 20, 22-23, 31-32, and Genesis 11. The documentary hypothesis attributes these genealogies to the Priestly source.

Biblical narrative
Abram and Sarai prospered materially but had no children. Abram thought to leave his estate to a trusted servant, but God promised him a son and heir. When he was 86 years old, Sarai suggested and Abram agreed that a practical way to have a child was through Sarai’s servant Hagar. Hagar conceived right away and in time Ishmael was born. This situation brought strife rather than happiness between Hagar and Sarai. Nevertheless, God saw Hagar’s suffering and promised that although this was not the child promised to Abram, he would nevertheless make Ishmael’s descendants into a great nation also.

In chapter 17 of Genesis, ""Almighty God"" changed Abram’s name to Abraham, for he would be a father of many nations. In addition, his wife Sarai's name was changed to Sarah, for she would be a mother of nations. Three visitors came to Abraham and said that he would have a son. Sarah believed she was too old to have a child and laughed. Yet she did conceive (Genesis 21:1-7) and had a baby named Isaac. After the death of his mother, Sarah, Isaac married Rebekah. Abraham then married Keturah, who bore him six more sons – Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak and Shuah.

Family tree
The following is a family tree for the descendants of the line of Noah's son Shem, through Abraham to Jacob and his sons. Dashed lines are marriage connections.

Quranic narrative 
 
The family members and descendants of Abraham are called aal-Ibrahim, figuratively ""The (people of) Abraham"".

As per:
فَقَدْ آتَيْنَا آلَ إِبْرَاهِيمَ الْكِتَابَ وَالْحِكْمَةَ وَآتَيْنَاهُم مُّلْكًا عَظِيمًا...
""… but surely, We had given the 'Family of Abraham'—the Writings and the Wisdom—and conferred to them a Kingdom of magnificence."" ⁠—Sūrat an-Nisā'  4, āyāt 54; al-Qur'ān. 

Other sources, particularly the widely accepted Hadith, also gives references to the Family of Abraham:
Tafsir Al-Tabari: aal-Ibrahim are the believers, based on a narrative related to Ibn Abbas of the verse: ""Indeed, Allah chose Adam and Noah and the family of Abraham and the family of 'Imran over the worlds"" V.33, S.3. He explained: They are the believers of the family of Abraham, the family of Imran, the family of Yaseen, and the family of Muhammad, then quoted the verse: ""Indeed, the most worthy of Abraham among the people are those who followed him [in submission to Allah] and this prophet, and those who believe [in his message]. And Allah is the ally of the believers."" V.68, S.3. They are the believers. 
Tafsir As-Sa'di: Aal Ibrahim are the prophets who succeeded him because they are among his descendants, and the Prophet Muhammad belongs to them.
Tafsir Al-Baghawi: Aal Ibrahim referred to Abraham himself, and has been also said that Aal Ibrahim are Ismael (Ishmael), Ishaq (Isaac), Ya'qub (Jacob), and Al-Asbat (the 12 sons of Jacob) adding that Muhammad is one of Aal Ibrahim.

Based on these interpretations, Aal Ibrahim are:
His wife, Sarah, since the Angels addressed her using the term (Ahl Al-Bayt) meaning, the people of the house in the verse: They said, ""Are you amazed at the decree of Allah? May the mercy of Allah and His blessings be upon you, people of the house."" Indeed, He is Praiseworthy and Honorable.""""V.73, S.11

And Noah, We guided before; and among his descendants, David and Solomon and Job and Joseph and Moses and Aaron. Thus do We reward the doers of good. And Zechariah and John and Jesus and Elias - and all were of the righteous. And Ishmael and Elisha and Jonah and Lot - and all [of them] We preferred over the worlds.

Today, Warumungu are mainly concentrated in the region of Tennant Creek and Alice Springs.

Language 

Their language is Warumungu, belonging to the Pama–Nyungan family. It is similar to the Warlpiri spoken by the Warlpiri people. It is a suffixing language, in which verbs are formed by adding a tense suffix (although some verbs are formed by compounding a preverb). As are many of the surviving Indigenous Australian languages, the Warumungu language is undergoing rapid change. The morphology used by younger speakers differs significantly than the one used by older speakers. An example of a Warumungu sentence might be "" apurtu im deya o warraku taun kana "", meaning "" Father's mother, is she there, in town, or not? "".

Warumungu is classified as a living language, but the number of speakers seemed to be decreasing quickly and by the mid-1950s, Australian linguist Robert Hoogenraad estimated that there were only about 700 people who could speak some Warumungu; by 1983, the population was estimated to be as small as 200 speakers.

Today, the language is in a robust position compared to many Aboriginal Australian languages, as it is being acquired by children and used in daily interaction by all generations, and the situation is sustainable, although some ethnic group members may prefer Kriol.

Country
In Norman Tindale's estimation, the Warumungu's lands once extended over some , from the northernmost reach at Mount Grayling (Renner Springs) southwards to the headwaters of the Gosse River. The eastern boundary was around Alroy and Rockhampton Downs. The western limits ran to the sand plan 50 miles west of Tennant Creek.

History 

In the 1870s, early white explorers described the Warumungu as a flourishing nation. However, by 1915, invasion and reprisal had brought them to the brink of starvation. In 1934, a reserve that had been set aside for the Warumungu in 1892 was revoked in order to clear the way for gold prospecting. By the 1960s, the Warumungu had been entirely removed from their native land.

""The post contact history of the Warumungu people is an unvarnished tale of the subordinaton of an Aboriginal society and its welfare to European interests... European settlement meant forced dispossession. This was not a once and for all process, but continued with the Warumungu being shunted around, right up to the 1960s, to accommodate various pastoral and mining interests.""

Tennant Creek is the urban centre of Warumungu country. During the 1970s, the era of Federal government self-determination policy, Aboriginal people began to move or return to Tennant Creek from cattle stations and Warrabri Aboriginal settlement. In the face of opposition at their attempts to settle in the town, from authorities and European towns people, Aboriginal people began to establish organisations to gain representation, infrastructure and services for their community. Over the next decade a housing authority Warramunga Pabulu Housing Association (later Julali-kari Council), a health service Anyininginyi Congress and an office of the Central Land Council was opened. Today, Aboriginal people of the region have rights to country surrounding the town, claimed and recognised under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976. The original land claim was lodged in 1978, for a decade the Warumungu fought for the return of their traditional lands. The ruling was made in 1988 and the hand back of the claim areas began soon after.

At the telegraph station to the south at Barrow Creek, conflict between the local Kaytetye and Europeans broke out in the 1870s and lead to punitive expeditions, in which many Kaytetye, Warumungu, Anmatyerre, and Alyawarre and Warlpiri were killed. Conflict, largely over cattle, and resultant frontier violence occurred in many places in central Australia in the first 50 years of settlement, causing the displacement of Aboriginal people. In the early 1900s Alyawarre and Wakaya fled violence at Hatcher's Creek and moved to Alexandria Station and other stations on the Barkly Tableland. Many moved later to Lake Nash. Eastern Warlpiri people fled after the Coniston massacre in 1928, many onto Warumungu country.

By the 1890s it is estimated that 100 people were living at camps around the Tennant Creek Telegraph Station, with some receiving rations, while some worked for the station. Many came to the site during the 1891-93 droughts, to the perennial waterholes along the creek, which Warumungu people traditionally used in drought years. An area of dry country to the east of the Telegraph Station was gazetted as a Warumungu Reserve in 1892, to be revoked in 1934 to allow mining in the area.

In the 1930s gold was discovered, starting a gold rush, which brought hopefuls from across the country. Aboriginal people worked on the mines, many of which were located on what had been the Warumungu Reserve. Tennant Creek town was established in 1934, at a site  to the south of the Telegraph Station. It was off-limits to Aboriginal people until the 1960s. Warumungu and Alyawarre people also worked at mines in the Davenport Murchison Ranges, after wolfram was discovered at Hatcher's Creek in 1913. Many Aboriginal people spent substantial periods of their lives there and on neighbouring Kurandi Station, where in 1977 Aboriginal workers went on strike and staged a walk-off.

The life histories of most people include their experiences living on cattle stations, which eventually surrounded the original site of European settlement. Vast tracts of Warumungu country had been granted as pastoral leases and were stocked from the 1880s onwards. Running cattle on these lands was incompatible with Aboriginal hunting and gathering practices and people were forced to settle on stations or the reserve. Many men worked as stockmen, drovers, butchers and gardeners, while women carried out domestic work in the station houses. Payment was generally in rations only and conditions were generally very poor.

Native title

In 1978, the Central Land Council of the Northern Territory made a claim on behalf of the Warumungu under the Aboriginal Land Rights Act. A lengthy legal battle ensued, in which the litigations eventually went to the High Court of Australia. Fifteen years later, in 1993, most of the land claim was finally returned to the Warumungu. The Warumungu Land Claim is made up of ten separate parcels of land, which together make up . In March 1993, Michael Maurice, a former Aboriginal Land Commissioner, said of the ordeal:

According to estimates, as many as 80% of the populace follow Shinto rituals to some degree, worshiping ancestors and spirits at domestic altars and public shrines. An almost equally high number is reported as Buddhist. Syncretic combinations of both, known generally as , are common; they represented Japan's dominant religion before the rise of State Shinto in the 19th century.

The western concept of ""religion"" is problematic in the Japanese context. Spirituality and worship are highly eclectic; rites and practices, often associated with well-being and worldly benefits, are of primary concern, while doctrines and beliefs garner minor attention. Religious affiliation is an alien notion. Although the vast majority of Japanese citizens follow Shinto, only some 3% identify as Shinto in surveys, because the term is understood to imply membership of organized Shinto sects. Some identify as , yet this does not signify rejection or apathy towards faith. The  is a specified identity, which is used mostly to affirm regular, ""normal"" religiosity while rejecting affiliation with distinct movements perceived as foreign or extreme.

Main religions

Shinto

, also , is the indigenous religion of Japan and of most of the people of Japan. George Williams classifies Shinto as an action-centered religion; it focuses on ritual practices to be carried out diligently in order to establish a connection between present-day Japan and its ancient roots. The written historical records of the  and  first recorded and codified Shinto practices in the 8th century. Still, these earliest Japanese writings do not refer to a unified ""Shinto religion"", but rather to a collection of native beliefs and of mythology. Shinto in the 21st century is the religion of public shrines devoted to the worship of a multitude of gods (), suited to various purposes such as war memorials and harvest festivals, and applies as well to various sectarian organizations. Practitioners express their diverse beliefs through a standard language and practice, adopting a similar style in dress and ritual dating from around the time of the Nara (710–794) and Heian (794–1185) periods.

The Japanese adopted the word Shinto (""way of the gods""), originally as Shindo, from the written Chinese  (), combining two kanji: , meaning ""spirit"" or ; and , meaning a philosophical path or study (from the Chinese word ). The oldest recorded usage of the word  dates from the second half of the 6th century.  are defined in English as ""spirits"", ""essences"" or ""gods"", referring to the energy generating the phenomena. Since the Japanese language does not distinguish between singular and plural,  refers to the divinity, or sacred essence, that manifests in multiple forms: rocks, trees, rivers, animals, places, and even people can be said to possess the nature of .  and people are not separate; they exist within the same world and share its interrelated complexity.

Shinto is the largest religion in Japan, practiced by nearly 80% of the population, yet only a small percentage of these identify themselves as ""Shintoists"" in surveys. This is due to the fact that ""Shinto"" has different meanings in Japan: most of the Japanese attend Shinto shrines and beseech kami without belonging to Shinto organisations, and since there are no formal rituals to become a member of folk ""Shinto"", ""Shinto membership"" is often estimated counting those who join organised Shinto sects. Shinto has 100,000 shrines and 78,890 priests in the country.

Shinto sects and new religions

Profound changes occurred in Japanese society in the 20th century (especially after World War II), including rapid industrialisation and urbanisation. Traditional religions, challenged by the transformation, underwent a reshaping themselves, and principles of religious freedom articulated by the 1947 constitution provided space for the proliferation of new religious movements.

New sects of Shinto, as well as movements claiming a thoroughly independent status, and also new forms of Buddhist lay societies, provided ways of aggregation for people uprooted from traditional families and village institutions. While traditional Shinto has a residential and hereditary basis, and a person participates in the worship activities devoted to the local tutelary deity or ancestor – occasionally asking for specific healing or blessing services or participating in pilgrimages – in the new religions individuals formed groups without regard to kinship or territorial origins, and such groups required a voluntary decision to join. These new religions also provided cohesion through a unified doctrine and practice shared by the nationwide community.

The officially recognized new religions number in the hundreds, and total membership reportedly numbers in the tens of millions. The largest new religion, Soka Gakkai, a Buddhist sect founded in 1930, has about 10 million members in Japan. Scholars in Japan have estimated that between 10% and 20% of the population belongs to the new religions, although more realistic estimates put the number at well below the 10% mark.  there are 223,831 priests and leaders of the new religions in Japan, three times the number of traditional Shinto priests.

Many of these new religions derive from Shinto, retain the fundamental characters of Shinto, and often identify themselves as forms of Shinto. These include Tenrikyo, Konkokyo, Omotokyo, Shinrikyo, Shinreikyo, Sekai Shindokyo, Zenrinkyo and others. Others are independent new religions, including Aum Shinrikyo, Mahikari movements, the Church of Perfect Liberty, Seicho-no-Ie, the Church of World Messianity, and others.

Buddhism

 first arrived in Japan in the 6th century, introduced in the year 538 or 552 from the kingdom of Baekje in Korea. The Baekje king sent the Japanese emperor a picture of the Buddha and some sutras. After overcoming brief yet violent oppositions by conservative forces, it was accepted by the Japanese court in 587. The Yamato state ruled over  centered around the worship of ancestral nature deities. It was also a period of intense immigration from Korea, horse riders from northeast Asia, as well as cultural influence from China, that had been unified under the Sui dynasty becoming the crucial power on the mainland. Buddhism functioned to affirm the state's power and mold its position in the broader culture of East Asia. Japanese aristocrats set about building Buddhist temples in the capital at Nara, and then in the later capital at Heian (now Kyoto).

The six Buddhist sects initially established in Nara are today together known as ""Nara Buddhism"" and are relatively small. When the capital moved to Heian, more forms of Buddhism arrived from China, including the still-popular Shingon Buddhism, an esoteric form of Buddhism similar to Tibet's Vajrayana Buddhism, and Tendai, a monastic conservative form known better by its Chinese name, Tiantai.

When the shogunate took power in the 12th century and the administrative capital moved to Kamakura, more forms of Buddhism arrived. The most popular was Zen, which became the most popular type of Buddhism of that time. Two schools of Zen were established, Rinzai and Sōtō; a third, Ōbaku, formed in 1661.

With the Meiji Restoration in 1868 and its accompanying centralisation of imperial power and modernisation of the state, Shinto was made the state religion. An order of elimination of mutual influence of Shinto and Buddhism was also enacted, followed by a movement to thoroughly eradicate Buddhism from Japan.

Today, the most popular school in Japan is Pure Land Buddhism, which arrived in the Kamakura period. It emphasizes the role of Amitabha Buddha and promises that reciting the phrase  upon death will result in being removed by Amitabha to the ""Western Paradise"" or ""Pure Land"", and then to Nirvana. Pure Land attracted the merchant and farmer classes. After the death of Honen, Pure Land's head missionary in Japan, the school split into two branches: , which focuses on repeating the phrase many times, and the more liberal , which claims that only saying the phrase once with a pure heart is necessary. Today, many Japanese adhere to , a conservative sect of .

Another prevalent form of Buddhism is Nichiren Buddhism, which was established by the 13th century monk Nichiren who underlined the importance of the Lotus Sutra. The main representatives of Nichiren Buddhism include sects such as  and , and lay organisations like  and —a denomination whose political wing forms the , Japan's third largest political party. Common to most lineages of Nichiren Buddhism is the chanting of  (or Nam Myoho Renge Kyo) and the  inscribed by Nichiren.

, there were 355,000+ Buddhist monks, priests and leaders in Japan, an increase of over 40,000 compared to 2000.

Minor religions

Christianity

Christianity (キリスト教 Kirisutokyō), in the form of Catholicism (カトリック教 Katorikkukyō), was introduced into Japan by Jesuit missions starting in 1549. In that year, the three Jesuits Francis Xavier, Cosme de Torres and Juan Fernández, landed in Kagoshima, in Kyushu, on 15 August. Portuguese traders were active in Kagoshima since 1543, welcomed by local daimyōs because they imported gunpowder. Anjirō, a Japanese convert, helped the Jesuits understanding Japanese culture and translating the first Japanese catechism.

These missionaries were successful in converting large numbers of people in Kyushu, including peasants, former Buddhist monks, and members of the warrior class. In 1559, a mission to the capital, Kyoto, was started. By the following year there were nine churches, and the Christian community grew steadily in the 1560s. By 1569 there were 30,000 Christians and 40 churches. Following the conversion of some lords in Kyushu, mass baptisms of the local populations occurred, and in the 1570s the number of Christians rose rapidly to 100,000.

Near the end of the 16th century, Franciscan missionaries arrived in Kyoto, despite a ban issued by Toyotomi Hideyoshi. In 1597, Hideyoshi proclaimed a more serious edict and executed 26 Franciscans in Nagasaki as a warning. Tokugawa Ieyasu and his successors enforced the prohibition of Christianity with several further edicts, especially after the Shimabara Rebellion in the 1630s. Many Christians continued to practice in secret. However, more importantly, the discourses on Christianity became the property of the state during the Tokugawa period. The state leveraged its power over to declare Christians enemies of the state in order to create and maintain a legally enforceable identity for Japanese subjects. As such, Christian identities or icons became the exclusive property of the Japanese state. Although often discussed as a ""foreign"" or ""minority"" religion, Christianity has played a key sociopolitical role in the lives of Japanese subjects and citizens for hundreds of years.

In 1873, following the Meiji Restoration, the ban was rescinded, freedom of religion was promulgated, and Protestant missionaries (プロテスタント Purotesutanto or 新教 Shinkyō, ""renewed teaching"") began to proselytise in Japan, intensifying their activities after World War II, yet they were never as successful as in Korea.

Today, there are 1.9 to 3 million Christians in Japan, most of them living in the western part of the country, where the missionaries' activities were greatest during the 16th century. Nagasaki Prefecture has the highest percentage of Christians: about 5.1% in 1996. As of 2007 there are 32,036 Christian priests and pastors in Japan. According to a poll conducted by the Gallup Organization in 2006, Christianity has increased significantly in Japan, particularly among youth, and a high number of teens are becoming Christians.

Throughout the latest century, some Western customs originally related to Christianity (including Western style weddings, Valentine's Day and Christmas) have become popular among many of the Japanese. For example, 60–70% of weddings performed in Japan are Christian-style. Christianity and Christian culture has a generally positive image in Japan.

Islam

Islam (イスラム教 Isuramukyō) in Japan is mostly represented by small immigrant communities from other parts of Asia. In 2008, Keiko Sakurai estimated that 80–90% of the Muslims in Japan were foreign-born migrants primarily from Indonesia, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Iran. It has been estimated that the Muslim immigrant population amounts to 10,000–50,000 people, while the ""estimated number of Japanese Muslims ranges from thousands to tens of thousands"".

Bahá'í Faith

The Bahá'í Faith (バハーイー教 Bahāiikyō) in Japan began after a few mentions of the country by 'Abdu'l-Bahá first in 1875. The first Japanese convert was , who lived in Honolulu, and accepted the faith in 1902; the second convert was . The first Bahá'í convert on Japanese soil was  in 1915. Almost a century later, the Association of Religion Data Archives (relying on World Christian Encyclopedia) estimated some 15,700 Bahá'ís in 2005.

Judaism

Judaism (ユダヤ教 Yudayakyō) in Japan is practiced by about 2,000 Jews living in the country. With the opening of Japan to the external world in 1853 and the end of Japan's sakoku foreign policy, some Jews immigrated to Japan from abroad, with the first recorded Jewish settlers arriving at Yokohama in 1861. The Jewish population continued to grow into the 1950s, fueled by immigration from Europe and the Middle East, with Tokyo and Kobe forming the largest communities.

During World War II, some European Jews fleeing the Holocaust found refuge in Japan. These mainly Polish Jews received a so-called Curaçao visa from the Dutch consul in Kaunas, Jan Zwartendijk. This allowed one Japanese diplomat, Chiune Sugihara, the Japanese consul to Lithuania, to issue Japanese transit visa. In doing so, both Zwartendijk and Sugihara disregarded orders and helped more than 6,000 Jews escape the Nazis. After World War II, a large portion of Japan's Jewish population emigrated, many going to what would become Israel. Some of those who remained married locals and were assimilated into Japanese society.

There are community centres serving Jews in Tokyo and Kobe. The Chabad-Lubavitch organization has two centers in Tokyo.

In September 2015, Japan nominated a Chief Rabbi for the first time, the head of Tokyo's Chabad House, Rabbi Binyamin Edrei.

Hinduism

Hinduism (ヒンドゥー教 Hindūkyō or 印度教 Indokyō) in Japan is practiced by a small number of people, mostly migrants from India, Nepal, Bali. Nevertheless, Hindu culture have had a significant but indirect role in Japanese culture, through the spread of Buddhism and the fascination of ancient world about Bharatvarsha . Four of the Japanese ""Seven Gods of Fortune"" originated as Hindu deities, including Benzaiten (Sarasvati), Bishamon (Vaiśravaṇa or Kubera), Daikoku (Mahakala/Shiva), and Kisshoutennyo (Laxmi). Various Hindu deities, including the aforementioned, are worshipped in Shingon Buddhism. This denomination, and all other forms of Tantric Buddhism, borrow heavily from Tantric Hinduism.

According to the Association of Religion Data Archives, there were 25,597 Hindus in Japan in 2015.

Sikhism

Sikhism (シク教 Sikukyō) is presently a minority religion in Japan mainly followed by families migrated from India.

Jainism

Jainism (ジャイナ教 Jainakyō) is a minority religion in Japan. , there were three Jain temples in the country.

Other religions of East Asia
Happy Science

Happy Science was founded in 1986 by Ryuho Okawa.  This Japanese religion has been very active in its political ventures to re-militarize Japan.

Ryukyuan religion

The Ryukyuan religion is the indigenous belief system of the people of Okinawa and the other Ryukyu Islands. While specific legends and traditions may vary slightly from place to place and island to island, the Ryukyuan religion is generally characterized by ancestor worship (more accurately termed ""ancestor respect"") and the respecting of relationships between the living, the dead, and the gods and spirits of the natural world. Some of its beliefs, such as those concerning genius loci spirits and many other beings classified between gods and humans, are indicative of its ancient animistic roots, as is its concern with , or life essence.

One of its most ancient features is the belief , the spiritual superiority of women derived from the goddess Amamikyu, which allowed for the development of a class of noro (priestesses) cult and yuta (female media). This differs from Japanese Shinto, where men are seen as the embodiment of purity. Ryukyuan religion has been influenced by Japanese Shinto and Buddhism, and various Chinese religions. It includes sects and reformed movements such as Ijun or Ijunism (Ryukyuan: いじゅん Ijun; Japanese: 違順教 Ijunkyō), founded in the 1970s.

Ainu folk religion

The Ainu religion  is the indigenous belief system of the Ainu people of Hokkaido and parts of Far Eastern Russia. It is an animistic religion centered around the belief that Kamuy (spirits or gods) live in everything.

Chinese folk religion

Most Chinese people in Japan practice the Chinese folk religion (), also known as Shenism (), that is very similar to Japanese Shinto.

The Chinese folk religion consists in the worship of the ethnic Chinese gods and ancestors, shen (神 ""gods"", ""spirits"", ""awarenesses"", ""consciousnesses"", ""archetypes""; literally ""expressions"", the energies that generate things and make them thrive), which can be nature deities, city deities or tutelary deities of other human agglomerations, national deities, cultural heroes and demigods, ancestors and progenitors of kinships. Holy narratives regarding some of these gods are codified into the body of Chinese mythology.

Taoism

Taoism (道教 Dōkyō) was introduced from China between the 7th and 8th centuries, and influenced in varying degrees the Japanese indigenous spirituality. Taoist practices were absorbed into Shinto, and Taoism was the source of the esoteric and mystical religions of Onmyōdō, Shugendō and Kōshin.

Taoism, being an indigenous religion in China, shares some roots with Shinto, although Taoism is more hermetic while Shinto is more shamanic. Taoism's influence in Japan has been less profound than that of Japanese Neo-Confucianism. Today, institutional Chinese Taoism is present in the country in the form of some temples; the Seitenkyū was founded in 1995.

Confucianism

Confucianism (儒教 Jukyō) was introduced from Korea during the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–1598), and developed into an elite religion, yet having a profound influence on the fabric of Japanese society overall during the Edo period. The Confucian philosophy can be characterized as humanistic and rationalistic, with the belief that the universe could be understood through human reason, corresponding to the universal reason (li), and thus it is up to man to create a harmonious relationship between the universe (天 Ten) and the individual. The rationalism of Neo-Confucianism was in contrast to the mysticism of Zen Buddhism in Japan. Unlike the Buddhists, the Neo-Confucians believed that reality existed, and could be understood by mankind, even if the interpretations of reality were slightly different depending on the school of Neo-Confucianism.

The social aspects of the philosophy are hierarchical with a focus on filial piety. This created a Confucian social stratification in Edo society that previously had not existed, dividing Japanese society into four main classes: samurai, farmers, artisans and merchants. The samurai were especially avid readers and teachers of Confucian thought in Japan, establishing many Confucian academies.

Neo-Confucianism also introduced elements of ethnocentrism into Japan. As the Chinese and Korean Neo-Confucians had regarded their own culture as the center of the world, the Japanese Neo-Confucians developed a similar national pride. This national pride would later evolve into the philosophical school of Kokugaku, which would later challenge Neo-Confucianism, and its perceived foreign Chinese and Korean origins, as the dominant philosophy of Japan.

Religious practices and holidays
Most Japanese participate in rituals and customs derived from several religious traditions. Life cycle events are often marked by visits to a Shinto shrine and Buddhist temples. The birth of a new baby is celebrated with a formal shrine or temple visit at the age of about one month, as are the third, fifth, and seventh birthdays (Shichi-Go-San) and the official beginning of adulthood at age twenty (Seijin shiki). The vast majority of Japanese wedding ceremonies have been Christian for at least the last three and half decades. Shinto weddings and secular weddings that follow a ""western-style"" format are also popular but much less so and a small fraction (usually less than one percent) of weddings are Buddhist.

Japanese funerals are usually performed by Buddhist priests, and Buddhist rites are also common on death day anniversaries of deceased family members. 91% of Japanese funerals take place according to Buddhist traditions.

There are two categories of holidays in Japan: matsuri (temple fairs), which are largely of Shinto origin (some are Buddhist like Hanamatsuri) and relate to the cultivation of rice and the spiritual well-being of the local community; and nenjyū gyōji (annual feasts), which are largely of Chinese or Buddhist origin. During the Heian period, the matsuri were organized into a formal calendar, and other festivals were added. Very few matsuri or annual feasts are national holidays, but they are included in the national calendar of annual events. Most matsuri are local events and follow local traditions. They may be sponsored by schools, towns, or other groups but are most often associated with Shinto shrines.

Some of the holidays are secular in nature, but the two most significant for the majority of Japanese—New Year's Day and Obon—involve visits to Shinto shrines or Buddhist temples and only Buddhist temples for later. The New Year's holiday (January 1–3) is marked by the practice of numerous customs and the consumption of special foods. Visiting Shinto shrines or Buddhist temples to pray for family blessings in the coming year, dressing in a kimono, hanging special decorations, eating noodles on New Year's Eve, and playing a poetry card game are among these practices. During Obon, bon (spirit altars) are set up in front of Buddhist family altars, which, along with ancestral graves, are cleaned in anticipation of the return of the spirits. People living away from their family homes return for visits with relatives. Celebrations include folk dancing and prayers at Buddhist temples as well as family rituals in the home.

Religion and law

In early Japanese history, the ruling class was responsible for performing propitiatory rituals, which later came to be identified as Shinto, and for the introduction and support of Buddhism. Later, religious organization was used by regimes for political purposes; for instance, the Tokugawa government required each family to be registered as a member of a Buddhist temple. In the early 19th century, the government required that each family belong to a shrine instead, and in the early 20th century, this was supplemented with the concept of a divine right to rule bestowed on the emperor. The Meiji Constitution reads: ""Japanese subjects shall, within limits not prejudicial to peace and order, and not antagonistic to their duties as subjects, enjoy freedom of religious belief"".

Article 20 of the 1947 Constitution states: ""Freedom of religion is guaranteed to all. No religious organization shall receive any privileges from the State, nor exercise any political authority. No person shall be compelled to take part in any religious act, celebration, rite or practice. The State and its organs shall refrain from religious education or any other religious activity"". This change in constitutional rights provided mechanisms for limiting state educational initiatives designed to promote Shinto beliefs in schools and freed the populace from mandatory participation in Shinto rites.

In postwar years, the issue of the separation of Shinto and state arose in the Self-Defense Force Apotheosis Case. In 1973, Nakaya Takafumi, a member of the Japanese Self-Defense Forces and husband of Nakaya Yasuko, died in a traffic accident. Despite Yasuko's refusal to provide relevant documents for her husband's enshrinement at the Yamaguchi prefectural National-Protecting Shrine, the prefectural Veterans’ Association requested the information from the Self-Defense Forces and completed the enshrinement. As a result, in 1973, Yasuko sued the Yamaguchi Prefectural Branch of the Self-Defense Forces, on the grounds that the ceremony of apotheosis violated her religious rights as a Christian.

Although Yasuko won the case at two lower courts, the ruling was overturned by the Supreme Court of Japan on June 1, 1988, based on the precedent established by the Tsu City Shinto Groundbreaking Ceremony Case. First, the Supreme Court ruled that because the Veterans’ Association—which was not an organ of the state—had acted alone when arranging the ceremony of apotheosis, no violation of Article 20 had occurred. Second, the Supreme Court held that the Self-Defense Forces' provision of Takafumi's documents to the Veterans’ Association did not constitute a religious activity prohibited by Article 20, because neither the intention nor the effects of its action harmed or patronized any religion.

Third, the Supreme Court adopted a narrow interpretation of individual religious rights, by ruling that violation of individual rights to religion did not occur unless the state or its organs coerced individuals to perform some religious activity or limited their religious freedom. On June 2, 1988, a report by the Los Angeles Times described the Japanese Supreme Court's decision as “a major setback for advocates of stronger separation of religion and state in Japan.” On June 7, 1988, an article published in the New York Times expressed concern that the Japanese Supreme Court's decision was likely to encourage the resurgence of State Shinto and nationalism. Because the prefectural National-Protecting Shrines perform the same ceremony of apotheosis as the Yasukuni Shrine does, the significance of this case also lies in its implications for the constitutionality of state patronage of and official visits to the Yasukuni Shrine.

Opposition to organised religion
Shichihei Yamamoto argues that Japan has shown greater tolerance towards irreligion than the West.

Comments against religion by notable figures
Shin'ichi Hisamatsu, philosopher and scholar who rejected theism, claimed that God or Buddha, as objective beings, are mere illusions.
Ito Hirobumi, four-time Prime Minister of Japan, who reportedly said: ""I regard religion itself as quite unnecessary for a nation's life; science is far above superstition, and what is religion – Buddhism or Christianity – but superstition, and therefore a possible source of weakness to a nation? I do not regret the tendency to free thought and atheism, which is almost universal in Japan because I do not regard it as a source of danger to the community"".
Hiroyuki Kato, who headed the Imperial Academy from 1905 to 1909 and said: ""Religion depends on fear"".
Haruki Murakami, a Japanese novelist who wrote: ""God only exists in people’s minds. Especially in Japan, God's always has been a kind of flexible concept. Look at what happened to the war. Douglas MacArthur ordered the divine emperor to quit being a God, and he did, making a speech saying he was just an ordinary person"".
Ando Shoeki, who denounced Confucian scholars and Buddhist clergy as spiritual oppressors of his age, though he still venerated the gods of old Japan as a pantheist would, equating them with the nature.
Fukuzawa Yukichi, who was regarded as one of the founders of modern Japan and found it impossible to combine modern learning with belief in gods, openly declaring: ""It goes without saying that the maintenance of peace and security in society requires a religion. For this purpose any religion will do. I lack a religious nature, and have never believed in any religion. I am thus open to the charge that I am advising others to be religious while I am not so. Yet my conscience does not permit me to clothe myself with religion when I have it not at heart...Of religions there are several kinds – Buddhism, Christianity, and what not. From my standpoint there is no more difference between those than between green tea and black..."".

Anti-religious organisations
The Japan Militant Atheists Alliance (Nihon Sentoteki Mushinronsha Domei, also known as Senmu) was founded in September 1931 by a group of antireligious people. The alliance opposed the idea of kokutai, the nation's founding myth, the presence of religion in public education, and the practice of State Shinto. Their greatest opposition was towards the imperial system of Japan.

Two months later, in November 1931, socialist Toshihiko Sakai and Communist Takatsu Seido created the Japan Anti-religion Alliance (Nihon Hanshukyo Domei). They opposed ""contributions to religious organizations, prayers for practical benefits (kito), preaching in factories, and the religious organizations of all stripes"" and viewed religion as a tool used by the upper class to suppress laborers and farmers.

Demographics

According to the annual statistical research on religion in 2015 by the Agency for Culture Affairs, Government of Japan: there are 181 thousand religious groups in Japan.

According to surveys carried out in 2006 and 2008, less than 40% of the population of Japan identifies with an organized religion: around 35% are Buddhists, 3% to 4% are members of Shinto sects and derived religions, and from fewer than 1% to 2.3% are Christians.

A leading figure in the music industry, he is regarded as one of the most influential musicians of the 20th century. Bowie was acclaimed by critics and musicians, particularly for his innovative work during the 1970s. His career was marked by reinvention and visual presentation, and his music and stagecraft had a significant impact on popular music.

Bowie developed an interest in music as a child. He studied art, music and design before embarking on a professional career as a musician in 1963. ""Space Oddity"", released in 1969, was his first top-five entry on the UK Singles Chart. After a period of experimentation, he re-emerged in 1972 during the glam rock era with his flamboyant and androgynous alter ego Ziggy Stardust. The character was spearheaded by the success of Bowie's single ""Starman"" and album The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars, which won him widespread popularity. In 1975, Bowie's style shifted towards a sound he characterised as ""plastic soul"", initially alienating many of his UK fans but garnering him his first major US crossover success with the number-one single ""Fame"" and the album Young Americans. In 1976, Bowie starred in the cult film The Man Who Fell to Earth and released Station to Station. In 1977, he again changed direction with the electronic-inflected album Low, the first of three collaborations with Brian Eno that came to be known as the ""Berlin Trilogy"". ""Heroes"" (1977) and Lodger (1979) followed; each album reached the UK top five and received lasting critical praise.

After uneven commercial success in the late 1970s, Bowie had three number-one hits: the 1980 single ""Ashes to Ashes"", its album Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps), and ""Under Pressure"" (a 1981 collaboration with Queen). He achieved massive commercial success in the 1980s starting with Let's Dance (1983). Between 1988 and 1992, he fronted the hard rock band Tin Machine before resuming his solo career in 1993. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, Bowie continued to experiment with musical styles, including industrial and jungle. He also continued acting; his roles included Major Jack Celliers in Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence (1983), Jareth the Goblin King in Labyrinth (1986), Pontius Pilate in The Last Temptation of Christ (1988), and Nikola Tesla in The Prestige (2006), among other film and television appearances and cameos. He stopped touring after 2004 and his last live performance was at a charity event in 2006. In 2013, Bowie returned from a decade-long recording hiatus with The Next Day. He remained musically active until his death from liver cancer at his home in New York City. He died two days after both his 69th birthday and the release of his final album, Blackstar (2016).

During his lifetime, his record sales, estimated at over 100 million records worldwide, made him one of the best-selling musicians of all time. In the UK, he was awarded ten platinum, eleven gold and eight silver album certifications, and released 11 number-one albums. In the US, he received five platinum and nine gold certifications. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996. Rolling Stone ranked him among the greatest artists in history. As of 2022, Bowie was the best-selling vinyl artist of the 21st century.

Early life
David Robert Jones was born on 8 January 1947 in Brixton, London. His mother, Margaret Mary ""Peggy"" (née Burns; 2 October 1913 – 2 April 2001), was born at Shorncliffe Army Camp near Cheriton, Kent. Her paternal grandparents were Irish immigrants who had settled in Manchester. She worked as a waitress at a cinema in Royal Tunbridge Wells. His father, Haywood Stenton ""John"" Jones (21 November 1912 – 5 August 1969), was from Doncaster, Yorkshire, and worked as a promotions officer for the children's charity Barnardo's. The family lived at 40 Stansfield Road, on the boundary between Brixton and Stockwell in the south London borough of Lambeth. Bowie attended Stockwell Infants School until he was six years old, acquiring a reputation as a gifted and single-minded child—and a defiant brawler.

From 1953 Bowie moved with his family to Bickley and then Bromley Common, before settling in Sundridge Park in 1955 where he attended Burnt Ash Junior School. His voice was considered ""adequate"" by the school choir, and he demonstrated above-average abilities in playing the recorder. At the age of nine, his dancing during the newly introduced music and movement classes was strikingly imaginative: teachers called his interpretations ""vividly artistic"" and his poise ""astonishing"" for a child. The same year, his interest in music was further stimulated when his father brought home a collection of American 45s by artists including the Teenagers, the Platters, Fats Domino, Elvis Presley (who shared Bowie's birthday), and Little Richard. Upon listening to Little Richard's song ""Tutti Frutti"", Bowie would later say that he had ""heard God"".

Bowie was first impressed with Presley when he saw his cousin Kristina dance to ""Hound Dog"" soon after it was released in 1956. According to Kristina, she and David ""danced like possessed elves"" to records of various artists. By the end of the following year, Bowie had taken up the ukulele and tea-chest bass, begun to participate in skiffle sessions with friends, and had started to play the piano; meanwhile, his stage presentation of numbers by both Presley and Chuck Berry—complete with gyrations in tribute to the original artists—to his local Wolf Cub group was described as ""mesmerizing ... like someone from another planet"". Having encouraged his son to follow his dreams of being an entertainer since he was a toddler, in the late 1950s David's father took him to meet singers and other performers preparing for the Royal Variety Performance, introducing him to Alma Cogan and Tommy Steele. After taking his eleven-plus exam at the conclusion of his Burnt Ash Junior education, Bowie went to Bromley Technical High School. It was an unusual technical school, as biographer Christopher Sandford wrote:

Bowie's maternal half-brother, Terry Burns, was a substantial influence on his early life. Burns, who was 10 years older than Bowie, had schizophrenia and seizures, and lived alternately at home and in psychiatric wards; while living with Bowie, he introduced the younger man to many of his lifelong influences, such as modern jazz, Buddhism, Beat poetry, and the occult. In addition to Burns, a significant proportion of Bowie's extended family members had schizophrenia spectrum disorders, including an aunt who was institutionalised and another who underwent a lobotomy; this has been labelled as an influence on his early work.

Bowie studied art, music, and design, including layout and typesetting. After Burns introduced him to modern jazz, his enthusiasm for players like Charles Mingus and John Coltrane led his mother to give him a Grafton saxophone in 1961. He was soon receiving lessons from baritone saxophonist Ronnie Ross. He received a serious injury at school in 1962 when his friend George Underwood punched him in the left eye during a fight over a girl. After a series of operations during a four-month hospitalisation, his doctors determined that the damage could not be fully repaired and Bowie was left with faulty depth perception and anisocoria (a permanently dilated pupil), which gave a false impression of a change in the iris' colour, erroneously suggesting he had heterochromia iridum (one iris a different colour to the other); his eye later became one of Bowie's most recognisable features. Despite their altercation, Bowie remained on good terms with Underwood, who went on to create the artwork for Bowie's early albums.

Music career

1962–1967: Early career to debut album

Bowie formed his first band, the Konrads, in 1962 at the age of 15. Playing guitar-based rock and roll at local youth gatherings and weddings, the Konrads had a varying line-up of between four and eight members, Underwood among them. When Bowie left the technical school the following year, he informed his parents of his intention to become a pop star. His mother arranged his employment as an electrician's mate. Frustrated by his bandmates' limited aspirations, Bowie left the Konrads and joined another band, the King Bees. He wrote to the newly successful washing-machine entrepreneur John Bloom inviting him to ""do for us what Brian Epstein has done for the Beatles—and make another million."" Bloom did not respond to the offer, but his referral to Dick James's partner Leslie Conn led to Bowie's first personal management contract.

Conn quickly began to promote Bowie. His debut single, ""Liza Jane"", credited to Davie Jones with the King Bees, was not commercially successful. Dissatisfied with the King Bees and their repertoire of Howlin' Wolf and Willie Dixon covers, Bowie quit the band less than a month later to join the Manish Boys, another blues outfit, who incorporated folk and soul—""I used to dream of being their Mick Jagger"", Bowie was to recall. Their cover of Bobby Bland's ""I Pity the Fool"" was no more successful than ""Liza Jane"", and Bowie soon moved on again to join the Lower Third, a blues trio strongly influenced by the Who. ""You've Got a Habit of Leaving"" fared no better, signalling the end of Conn's contract. Declaring that he would exit the pop music world ""to study mime at Sadler's Wells"", Bowie nevertheless remained with the Lower Third. His new manager, Ralph Horton, later instrumental in his transition to solo artist, helped secure him a contract with Pye Records. Publicist Tony Hatch signed Bowie on the basis that he wrote his own songs. Dissatisfied with Davy (and Davie) Jones, which in the mid-1960s invited confusion with Davy Jones of the Monkees, he took on the stage name David Bowie after the 19th-century American pioneer James Bowie and the knife he had popularised. His first release under the name was the January 1966 single ""Can't Help Thinking About Me"", recorded with the Lower Third. The single flopped like its predecessors.

After the single's release, Bowie departed the Lower Third, partly due to Horton's influence, and released two more singles for Pye, ""Do Anything You Say"" and ""I Dig Everything"", both of which featured a new band called the Buzz, before signing with Deram Records. Around this time Bowie also joined the Riot Squad; their recordings, which included one of Bowie's original songs and material by the Velvet Underground, went unreleased. Kenneth Pitt, introduced by Horton, took over as Bowie's manager. His April 1967 solo single, ""The Laughing Gnome"", on which speeded-up and thus high-pitched vocals were used to portray the gnome in the song, failed to chart. Released six weeks later, his album debut, David Bowie, an amalgam of pop, psychedelia and music hall, met the same fate. It was his last release for two years. In September, Bowie recorded ""Let Me Sleep Beside You"" and ""Karma Man"", which were rejected by Deram for release as a single and left unreleased until 1970. Both tracks marked the beginning of Bowie's working relationship with producer Tony Visconti which, with large gaps, would last for the rest of Bowie's career.

1968–1971: Space Oddity to Hunky Dory 

Studying the dramatic arts under Lindsay Kemp, from avant-garde theatre and mime to commedia dell'arte, Bowie became immersed in the creation of personae to present to the world. Satirising life in a British prison, the Bowie composition ""Over The Wall We Go"" became a 1967 single for Oscar; another Bowie song, ""Silly Boy Blue"", was released by Billy Fury the following year. Playing acoustic guitar, Hermione Farthingale formed a group with Bowie and guitarist John Hutchinson named Feathers; between September 1968 and early 1969 the trio gave a small number of concerts combining folk, Merseybeat, poetry, and mime.

After the break-up with Farthingale, Bowie moved in with Mary Finnigan as her lodger. In February and March 1969, he undertook a short tour with Marc Bolan's duo Tyrannosaurus Rex, as third on the bill, performing a mime act. On 11 July 1969, ""Space Oddity"" was released five days ahead of the Apollo 11 launch, and reached the top five in the UK. Continuing the divergence from rock and roll and blues begun by his work with Farthingale, Bowie joined forces with Finnigan, Christina Ostrom and Barrie Jackson to run a folk club on Sunday nights at the Three Tuns pub in Beckenham High Street. The club was influenced by the Arts Lab movement, developing into the Beckenham Arts Lab and became extremely popular. The Arts Lab hosted a free festival in a local park, the subject of his song ""Memory of a Free Festival"".

Bowie's second album followed in November; originally issued in the UK as David Bowie, it caused some confusion with its predecessor of the same name, and the early US release was instead titled Man of Words/Man of Music; it was reissued internationally in 1972 by RCA Records as Space Oddity. Featuring philosophical post-hippie lyrics on peace, love, and morality, its acoustic folk rock occasionally fortified by harder rock, the album was not a commercial success at the time of its release.

Bowie met Angela Barnett in April 1969. They married within a year. Her impact on him was immediate, and her involvement in his career far-reaching, leaving manager Ken Pitt with limited influence which he found frustrating. Having established himself as a solo artist with ""Space Oddity"", Bowie began to sense a lacking: ""a full-time band for gigs and recording—people he could relate to personally"". The shortcoming was underlined by his artistic rivalry with Marc Bolan, who was at the time acting as his session guitarist. The band Bowie assembled comprised John Cambridge, a drummer Bowie met at the Arts Lab, Tony Visconti on bass and Mick Ronson on electric guitar. Known as Hype, the bandmates created characters for themselves and wore elaborate costumes that prefigured the glam style of the Spiders from Mars. After a disastrous opening gig at the London Roundhouse, they reverted to a configuration presenting Bowie as a solo artist. Their initial studio work was marred by a heated disagreement between Bowie and Cambridge over the latter's drumming style. Matters came to a head when an enraged Bowie accused the drummer of the disturbance, exclaiming ""You're fucking up my album."" Cambridge left and was replaced by Mick Woodmansey. Not long after, Bowie fired his manager and replaced him with Tony Defries. This resulted in years of litigation that concluded with Bowie having to pay Pitt compensation.

The studio sessions continued and resulted in Bowie's third album, The Man Who Sold the World (1970), which contained references to schizophrenia, paranoia, and delusion. It represented a departure from the acoustic guitar and folk-rock style established by Space Oddity, to a more hard rock sound. To promote it in the US, Mercury Records financed a coast-to-coast publicity tour across America in which Bowie, between January and February 1971, was interviewed by radio stations and the media. Exploiting his androgynous appearance, the original cover of the UK version unveiled two months later depicted Bowie wearing a dress. He took the dress with him and wore it during interviews, to the approval of critics – including Rolling Stones John Mendelsohn, who described him as ""ravishing, almost disconcertingly reminiscent of Lauren Bacall"" – and in the street, to mixed reaction including laughter and, in the case of one male pedestrian, producing a gun and telling Bowie to ""kiss my ass"".

During the tour, Bowie's observation of two seminal American proto-punk artists led him to develop a concept that eventually found form in the Ziggy Stardust character: a melding of the persona of Iggy Pop with the music of Lou Reed, producing ""the ultimate pop idol"". A girlfriend recalled his ""scrawling notes on a cocktail napkin about a crazy rock star named Iggy or Ziggy"", and on his return to England he declared his intention to create a character ""who looks like he's landed from Mars"". The ""Stardust"" surname was a tribute to the ""Legendary Stardust Cowboy"", whose record he was given during the tour. Bowie would later cover ""I Took a Trip on a Gemini Space Ship"" on 2002's Heathen.

Hunky Dory (1971) found Visconti, Bowie's producer and bassist, supplanted in both roles by Ken Scott and Trevor Bolder, respectively. It again featured a stylistic shift towards art pop and melodic pop rock. It featured light fare tracks such as ""Kooks"", a song written for his son, Duncan Zowie Haywood Jones, born on 30 May. (His parents chose ""his kooky name""—he was known as Zowie for the next 12 years—after the Greek word zoe, life.) Elsewhere, the album explored more serious subjects, and found Bowie paying unusually direct homage to his influences with ""Song for Bob Dylan"", ""Andy Warhol"", and ""Queen Bitch"", the latter a Velvet Underground pastiche. His first release through RCA Records, it was a commercial failure, partly due lack of promotion from the label.

1972–1974: Glam rock era

Dressed in a striking costume, his hair dyed reddish-brown, Bowie launched his Ziggy Stardust stage show with the Spiders from Mars—Ronson, Bolder, and Woodmansey—at the Toby Jug pub in Tolworth in Kingston upon Thames on 10 February 1972. The show was hugely popular, catapulting him to stardom as he toured the UK over the next six months and creating, as described by Buckley, a ""cult of Bowie"" that was ""unique—its influence lasted longer and has been more creative than perhaps almost any other force within pop fandom."" The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), combining the hard rock elements of The Man Who Sold the World with the lighter experimental rock and pop of Hunky Dory, was released in June and was considered one of the defining albums of glam rock. ""Starman"", issued as an April single ahead of the album, was to cement Bowie's UK breakthrough: both single and album charted rapidly following his July Top of the Pops performance of the song. The album, which remained in the chart for two years, was soon joined there by the six-month-old Hunky Dory. At the same time, the non-album single ""John, I'm Only Dancing"", and ""All the Young Dudes"", a song he wrote and produced for Mott the Hoople, were successful in the UK. The Ziggy Stardust Tour continued to the United States.

Bowie contributed backing vocals, keyboards, and guitar to Reed's 1972 solo breakthrough Transformer, co-producing the album with Mick Ronson. The following year, Bowie co-produced and mixed the Stooges' album Raw Power alongside Iggy Pop. His own Aladdin Sane (1973) topped the UK chart, his first number-one album. Described by Bowie as ""Ziggy goes to America"", it contained songs he wrote while travelling to and across the US during the earlier part of the Ziggy tour, which now continued to Japan to promote the new album. Aladdin Sane spawned the UK top five singles ""The Jean Genie"" and ""Drive-In Saturday"".

Bowie's love of acting led to his total immersion in the characters he created for his music. ""Offstage I'm a robot. Onstage I achieve emotion. It's probably why I prefer dressing up as Ziggy to being David."" With satisfaction came severe personal difficulties: acting the same role over an extended period, it became impossible for him to separate Ziggy Stardust—and later, the Thin White Duke—from his own character offstage. Ziggy, Bowie said, ""wouldn't leave me alone for years. That was when it all started to go sour ... My whole personality was affected. It became very dangerous. I really did have doubts about my sanity."" His later Ziggy shows, which included songs from both Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane, were ultra-theatrical affairs filled with shocking stage moments, such as Bowie stripping down to a sumo wrestling loincloth or simulating oral sex with Ronson's guitar. Bowie toured and gave press conferences as Ziggy before a dramatic and abrupt on-stage ""retirement"" at London's Hammersmith Odeon on 3 July 1973. Footage from the final show was incorporated for the film Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars, which premiered in 1979 and commercially released in 1983.

After breaking up the Spiders from Mars, Bowie attempted to move on from his Ziggy persona. His back catalogue was now highly sought after: The Man Who Sold the World had been re-released in 1972 along with Space Oddity. ""Life on Mars?"", from Hunky Dory, was released in June 1973 and peaked at number three on the UK Singles Chart. Entering the same chart in September, Bowie's novelty record from 1967, ""The Laughing Gnome"", reached number six. Pin Ups, a collection of covers of his 1960s favourites, followed in October, producing a UK number three hit in his version of the McCoys's ""Sorrow"" and itself peaking at number one, making David Bowie the best-selling act of 1973 in the UK. It brought the total number of Bowie albums concurrently on the UK chart to six.

1974–1976: ""Plastic soul"" and the Thin White Duke

Bowie moved to the US in 1974, initially staying in New York City before settling in Los Angeles. Diamond Dogs (1974), parts of which found him heading towards soul and funk, was the product of two distinct ideas: a musical based on a wild future in a post-apocalyptic city, and setting George Orwell's 1984 to music. The album went to number one in the UK, spawning the hits ""Rebel Rebel"" and ""Diamond Dogs"", and number five in the US. To promote it, Bowie launched the Diamond Dogs Tour, visiting cities in North America between June and December 1974. Choreographed by Toni Basil, and lavishly produced with theatrical special effects, the high-budget stage production was filmed by Alan Yentob. The resulting documentary, Cracked Actor, featured a pasty and emaciated Bowie: the tour coincided with his slide from heavy cocaine use into addiction, producing severe physical debilitation, paranoia, and emotional problems. He later commented that the accompanying live album, David Live, ought to have been titled ""David Bowie Is Alive and Well and Living Only in Theory"". David Live nevertheless solidified Bowie's status as a superstar, charting at number two in the UK and number eight in the US. It also spawned a UK number ten hit in Bowie's cover of Eddie Floyd's ""Knock on Wood"". After a break in Philadelphia, where Bowie recorded new material, the tour resumed with a new emphasis on soul.

The fruit of the Philadelphia recording sessions was Young Americans (1975). Sandford writes, ""Over the years, most British rockers had tried, one way or another, to become black-by-extension. Few had succeeded as Bowie did now."" The album's sound, which Bowie identified as ""plastic soul"", constituted a radical shift in style that initially alienated many of his UK devotees. Young Americans yielded Bowie's first US number one, ""Fame"", co-written with John Lennon, who contributed backing vocals, and Carlos Alomar. Lennon called Bowie's work ""great, but it's just rock'n'roll with lipstick on"". Earning the distinction of being one of the first white artists to appear on the US variety show Soul Train, Bowie mimed ""Fame"", as well as ""Golden Years"", his November single, which was originally offered to Elvis Presley, who declined it. Young Americans was a commercial success in both the US and the UK, and a re-issue of the 1969 single ""Space Oddity"" became Bowie's first number-one hit in the UK a few months after ""Fame"" achieved the same in the US. Despite his by now well-established superstardom, Bowie, in the words of Sandford, ""for all his record sales (over a million copies of Ziggy Stardust alone), existed essentially on loose change."" In 1975, in a move echoing Pitt's acrimonious dismissal five years earlier, Bowie fired his manager. At the culmination of the ensuing months-long legal dispute, he watched, as described by Sandford, ""millions of dollars of his future earnings being surrendered"" in what were ""uniquely generous terms for Defries"", then ""shut himself up in West 20th Street, where for a week his howls could be heard through the locked attic door."" Michael Lippman, Bowie's lawyer during the negotiations, became his new manager; Lippman, in turn, was awarded substantial compensation when Bowie fired him the following year.

Station to Station (1976), produced by Bowie and Harry Maslin, introduced a new Bowie persona, ""The Thin White Duke"" of its title-track. Visually, the character was an extension of Thomas Jerome Newton, the extraterrestrial being he portrayed in the film The Man Who Fell to Earth the same year. Developing the funk and soul of Young Americans, Station to Stations synthesizer-heavy arrangements prefigured the krautrock-influenced music of his next releases. The extent to which drug addiction was now affecting Bowie was made public when Russell Harty interviewed him for his London Weekend Television talk show in anticipation of the album's supporting tour. Shortly before the satellite-linked interview was scheduled to commence, the death of the Spanish dictator Francisco Franco was announced. Bowie was asked to relinquish the satellite booking, to allow the Spanish Government to put out a live newsfeed. This he refused to do, and his interview went ahead. In the ensuing lengthy conversation with Harty, Bowie was incoherent and looked ""disconnected"". His sanity—by his own later admission—had become twisted from cocaine; he overdosed several times during the year and was withering physically to an alarming degree.

Station to Stations January 1976 release was followed in February by a -month-long concert tour of Europe and North America. Featuring a starkly lit set, the Isolar – 1976 Tour with its colour newsprint Isolar concert program, highlighted songs from the album, including the dramatic and lengthy title track, the ballads ""Wild Is the Wind"" and ""Word on a Wing"", and the funkier ""TVC 15"" and ""Stay"". The core band that coalesced to record this album and tour—rhythm guitarist Carlos Alomar, bassist George Murray, and drummer Dennis Davis—continued as a stable unit for the remainder of the 1970s. The tour was highly successful but mired in political controversy. Bowie was quoted in Stockholm as saying that ""Britain could benefit from a Fascist leader"", and was detained by customs on the Russian/Polish border for possessing Nazi paraphernalia.

Matters came to a head in London in May in what became known as the ""Victoria Station incident"". Arriving in an open-top Mercedes convertible, Bowie waved to the crowd in a gesture that some alleged was a Nazi salute, which was captured on camera and published in NME. Bowie said the photographer caught him in mid-wave. He later blamed his pro-fascism comments and his behaviour during the period on his addictions and the character of the Thin White Duke. ""I was out of my mind, totally crazed. The main thing I was functioning on was mythology ... that whole thing about Hitler and Rightism ... I'd discovered King Arthur"". According to playwright Alan Franks, writing later in The Times, ""he was indeed 'deranged'. He had some very bad experiences with hard drugs."" Bowie's cocaine addiction, which had motivated these controversies, had much to do with his time living in Los Angeles, a city which alienated him. Discussing his flirtations with fascism in a 1980 interview with NME, Bowie explained that Los Angeles was ""where it had all happened. The fucking place should be wiped off the face of the Earth. To be anything to do with rock and roll and go and live in Los Angeles is, I think, just heading for disaster. It really is.""

After recovering from addiction, Bowie apologised for these statements, and throughout the 1980s and 1990s criticised racism in European politics and the American music industry. Nevertheless, Bowie's comments on fascism, as well as Eric Clapton's alcohol-fuelled denunciations of Pakistani immigrants in 1976, led to the establishment of Rock Against Racism.

1976–1979: Berlin era

Before the end of 1976, Bowie's interest in the burgeoning German music scene, as well as his drug addiction, prompted him to move to West Berlin to clean up and revitalise his career. There he was often seen riding a bicycle between his apartment on Hauptstraße in Schöneberg and Hansa Tonstudio, the recording studio he used, located on Köthener Straße in Kreuzberg, near the Berlin Wall. While working with Brian Eno and sharing an apartment with Iggy Pop, he began to focus on minimalist, ambient music for the first of three albums, co-produced with Tony Visconti, that became known as the Berlin Trilogy. During the same period, Iggy Pop, with Bowie as a co-writer and musician, completed his solo album debut The Idiot and its follow-up Lust for Life, touring the UK, Europe, and the US in March and April 1977.

The album Low (1977), partly influenced by the Krautrock sound of Kraftwerk and Neu!, evinced a move away from narration in Bowie's songwriting to a more abstract musical form in which lyrics were sporadic and optional. Although he completed the album in November 1976, it took his unsettled record company another three months to release it. It received considerable negative criticism upon its release—a release which RCA, anxious to maintain the established commercial momentum, did not welcome, and which Bowie's former manager, Tony Defries, who maintained a significant financial interest in Bowie's affairs, tried to prevent. Despite these forebodings, Low yielded the UK number three single ""Sound and Vision"", and its own performance surpassed that of Station to Station in the UK chart, where it reached number two. Contemporary composer Philip Glass described Low as ""a work of genius"" in 1992, when he used it as the basis for his Symphony No. 1 ""Low""; subsequently, Glass used Bowie's next album as the basis for his 1996 Symphony No. 4 ""Heroes"". Glass has praised Bowie's gift for creating ""fairly complex pieces of music, masquerading as simple pieces"". Also in 1977, London released Starting Point, a ten-song LP containing releases from Bowie's Deram period (1966–67).

Echoing Lows minimalist, instrumental approach, the second of the trilogy, ""Heroes"" (1977), incorporated pop and rock to a greater extent, seeing Bowie joined by guitarist Robert Fripp. Like Low, ""Heroes"" evinced the zeitgeist of the Cold War, symbolised by the divided city of Berlin. Incorporating ambient sounds from a variety of sources including white noise generators, synthesisers and koto, the album was another hit, reaching number three in the UK. Its title-track, though only reaching number 24 in the UK singles chart, gained lasting popularity, and within months had been released in both German and French. Towards the end of the year, Bowie performed the song for Marc Bolan's television show Marc, and again two days later for Bing Crosby's final CBS television Christmas special, when he joined Crosby in ""Peace on Earth/Little Drummer Boy"", a version of ""The Little Drummer Boy"" with a new, contrapuntal verse. Five years later, the duet proved a worldwide seasonal hit, charting in the UK at number three on Christmas Day, 1982.

After completing Low and ""Heroes"", Bowie spent much of 1978 on the Isolar II world tour, bringing the music of the first two Berlin Trilogy albums to almost a million people during 70 concerts in 12 countries. By now he had broken his drug addiction; biographer David Buckley writes that Isolar II was ""Bowie's first tour for five years in which he had probably not anaesthetised himself with copious quantities of cocaine before taking the stage. ... Without the oblivion that drugs had brought, he was now in a healthy enough mental condition to want to make friends."" Recordings from the tour made up the live album Stage, released the same year. Bowie also recorded narration for an adaptation of Sergei Prokofiev's classical composition Peter and the Wolf, which was released as an album in May 1978.

The final piece in what Bowie called his ""triptych"", Lodger (1979), eschewed the minimalist, ambient nature of the other two, making a partial return to the drum- and guitar-based rock and pop of his pre-Berlin era. The result was a complex mixture of new wave and world music, in places incorporating Hijaz non-Western scales. Some tracks were composed using Eno and Peter Schmidt's Oblique Strategies cards: ""Boys Keep Swinging"" entailed band members swapping instruments, ""Move On"" used the chords from Bowie's early composition ""All the Young Dudes"" played backwards, and ""Red Money"" took backing tracks from ""Sister Midnight"", a piece previously composed with Iggy Pop. The album was recorded in Switzerland. Ahead of its release, RCA's Mel Ilberman described it as ""a concept album that portrays the Lodger as a homeless wanderer, shunned and victimized by life's pressures and technology."" Regarding the record, Sandford states: ""[It] dashed such high hopes with dubious choices, and production that spelt the end—for fifteen years—of Bowie's partnership with Eno."" Lodger reached number four in the UK and number 20 in the US, and yielded the UK hit singles ""Boys Keep Swinging"" and ""DJ"". Towards the end of the year, Bowie and Angie initiated divorce proceedings, and after months of court battles the marriage was ended in early 1980.

1980–1988: New Romantic and pop era

Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps) (1980) produced the number-one hit ""Ashes to Ashes"", featuring the textural work of guitar-synthesist Chuck Hammer and revisiting the character of Major Tom from ""Space Oddity"". The song gave international exposure to the underground New Romantic movement when Bowie visited the London club ""Blitz""—the main New Romantic hangout—to recruit several of the regulars (including Steve Strange of the band Visage) to act in the accompanying video, renowned as one of the most innovative of all time. While Scary Monsters used principles established by the Berlin albums, it was considered by critics to be far more direct musically and lyrically. The album's hard rock edge included conspicuous guitar contributions from Robert Fripp, Chuck Hammer, and Pete Townshend. As ""Ashes to Ashes"" hit number one on the UK charts, Bowie opened a five-month run on Broadway on 29 July, starring as John Merrick in The Elephant Man.

Bowie paired with Queen in 1981 for a one-off single release, ""Under Pressure"". The duet was a hit, becoming Bowie's third UK number-one single. Bowie was given the lead role in the BBC's 1982 televised adaptation of Bertolt Brecht's play Baal. Coinciding with its transmission, a five-track EP of songs from the play, recorded earlier in Berlin, was released as David Bowie in Bertolt Brecht's Baal. In March 1982, the month before Paul Schrader's film Cat People came out, Bowie's title song, ""Cat People (Putting Out Fire)"", was released as a single, becoming a minor US hit and entering the UK Top 30.

Bowie reached his peak of popularity and commercial success in 1983 with Let's Dance. Co-produced by Chic's Nile Rodgers, the album went platinum in both the UK and the US. Its three singles became Top 20 hits in both countries, where its title track reached number one. ""Modern Love"" and ""China Girl"" each made number two in the UK, accompanied by a pair of ""absorbing"" promotional videos that biographer David Buckley said ""activated key archetypes in the pop world... 'Let's Dance', with its little narrative surrounding the young Aboriginal couple, targeted 'youth', and 'China Girl', with its bare-bummed (and later partially censored) beach lovemaking scene (a homage to the film From Here to Eternity), was sufficiently sexually provocative to guarantee heavy rotation on MTV"". Stevie Ray Vaughan was a guest guitarist playing solo on ""Let's Dance"", although the video depicts Bowie miming this part. By 1983, Bowie had emerged as one of the most important video artists of the day. Let's Dance was followed by the Serious Moonlight Tour, during which Bowie was accompanied by guitarist Earl Slick and backing vocalists Frank and George Simms. The world tour lasted six months and was extremely popular. At the 1984 MTV Video Music Awards Bowie received two awards including the inaugural Video Vanguard Award.

Tonight (1984), another dance-oriented album, found Bowie collaborating with Tina Turner and, once again, Iggy Pop. It included a number of cover songs, among them the 1966 Beach Boys hit ""God Only Knows"". The album bore the transatlantic Top 10 hit ""Blue Jean"", itself the inspiration for a short film that won Bowie a Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video, Jazzin' for Blue Jean. Bowie performed at Wembley Stadium in 1985 for Live Aid, a multi-venue benefit concert for Ethiopian famine relief. During the event, the video for a fundraising single, Bowie's duet with Mick Jagger, was premiered. ""Dancing in the Street"" quickly went to number one on release. The same year, Bowie worked with the Pat Metheny Group to record ""This Is Not America"" for the soundtrack of The Falcon and the Snowman. Released as a single, the song became a Top 40 hit in the UK and US.

Bowie was given a role in the 1986 film Absolute Beginners. It was poorly received by critics, but Bowie's theme song, also named ""Absolute Beginners"", rose to number two in the UK charts. He also appeared as Jareth, the Goblin King, in the 1986 Jim Henson film Labyrinth, for which he worked with composer Trevor Jones and wrote five original songs. His final solo album of the decade was 1987's Never Let Me Down, where he ditched the light sound of his previous two albums, instead offering harder rock with an industrial/techno dance edge. Peaking at number six in the UK, the album yielded the hits ""Day-In, Day-Out"", ""Time Will Crawl"", and ""Never Let Me Down"". Bowie later described it as his ""nadir"", calling it ""an awful album"". Supporting Never Let Me Down, and preceded by nine promotional press shows, the 86-concert Glass Spider Tour commenced on 30 May. Bowie's backing band included Peter Frampton on lead guitar. Contemporary critics maligned the tour as overproduced, saying it pandered to the current stadium rock trends in its special effects and dancing, although in later years critics acknowledged the tour's strengths and influence on concert tours by other artists, such as Britney Spears, Madonna, and U2.

1989–1991: Tin Machine

Bowie shelved his solo career in 1989, retreating to the relative anonymity of band membership for the first time since the early 1970s. A hard-rocking quartet, Tin Machine came into being after Bowie began to work experimentally with guitarist Reeves Gabrels. The line-up was completed by Tony and Hunt Sales, whom Bowie had known since the late 1970s for their contribution, on bass and drums respectively, to Iggy Pop's 1977 album Lust for Life. The Sales brothers are sons of American comedian and actor Soupy Sales.

Although he intended Tin Machine to operate as a democracy, Bowie dominated, both in songwriting and in decision-making. The band's album debut, Tin Machine (1989), was initially popular, though its politicised lyrics did not find universal approval: Bowie described one song as ""a simplistic, naive, radical, laying-it-down about the emergence of Neo-Nazis""; in the view of Sandford, ""It took nerve to denounce drugs, fascism and TV ... in terms that reached the literary level of a comic book."" EMI complained of ""lyrics that preach"" as well as ""repetitive tunes"" and ""minimalist or no production"". The album nevertheless reached number three and went gold in the UK.

Tin Machine's first world tour was a commercial success, but there was growing reluctance—among fans and critics alike—to accept Bowie's presentation as merely a band member. A series of Tin Machine singles failed to chart, and Bowie, after a disagreement with EMI, left the label. Like his audience and his critics, Bowie himself became increasingly disaffected with his role as just one member of a band. Tin Machine began work on a second album, but Bowie put the venture on hold and made a return to solo work. Performing his early hits during the seven-month Sound+Vision Tour, he found commercial success and acclaim once again.

In October 1990, a decade after his divorce from Angie, Bowie and Somali-born supermodel Iman were introduced by a mutual friend. Bowie recalled, ""I was naming the children the night we met ... it was absolutely immediate."" They married in 1992. Tin Machine resumed work the same month, but their audience and critics, ultimately left disappointed by the first album, showed little interest in a second. Tin Machine IIs arrival was marked by a widely publicised and ill-timed conflict over the cover art: after production had begun, the new record label, Victory, deemed the depiction of four ancient nude Kouroi statues, judged by Bowie to be ""in exquisite taste"", to be ""a show of wrong, obscene images"", requiring air-brushing and patching to render the figures sexless. Tin Machine toured again, but after the live album Tin Machine Live: Oy Vey, Baby failed commercially, the band drifted apart, and Bowie, though he continued to collaborate with Gabrels, resumed his solo career.

1992–1998: Electronic period
On 20 April 1992, Bowie appeared at The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert, following the Queen singer's death the previous year. As well as performing ""Heroes"" and ""All the Young Dudes"", he was joined on ""Under Pressure"" by Annie Lennox, who took Mercury's vocal part; during his appearance, Bowie knelt and recited the Lord's Prayer at Wembley Stadium. Four days later, Bowie and Iman were married in Switzerland. Intending to move to Los Angeles, they flew in to search for a suitable property, but found themselves confined to their hotel, under curfew: the 1992 Los Angeles riots began the day they arrived. They settled in New York instead.

In 1993, Bowie released his first solo offering since his Tin Machine departure, the soul, jazz, and hip-hop influenced Black Tie White Noise. Making prominent use of electronic instruments, the album, which reunited Bowie with Let's Dance producer Nile Rodgers, confirmed Bowie's return to popularity, hitting the number-one spot on the UK charts and spawning three Top 40 hits, including the Top 10 single ""Jump They Say"". Bowie explored new directions on The Buddha of Suburbia (1993), ostensibly a soundtrack album of his music composed for the BBC television adaptation of Hanif Kureishi's novel. Only the title track had been used in the television adaptation, although some of his themes for it were also present on the album. It contained some of the new elements introduced in Black Tie White Noise, and also signalled a move towards alternative rock. The album was a critical success but received a low-key release and only made number 87 in the UK charts.

Reuniting Bowie with Eno, the quasi-industrial Outside (1995) was originally conceived as the first volume in a non-linear narrative of art and murder. Featuring characters from a short story written by Bowie, the album achieved UK and US chart success and yielded three Top 40 UK singles. In a move that provoked mixed reactions from both fans and critics, Bowie chose Nine Inch Nails as his tour partner for the Outside Tour. Visiting cities in Europe and North America between September 1995 and February 1996, the tour saw the return of Gabrels as Bowie's guitarist. On 7 January 1997, Bowie celebrated his half century with a 50th birthday concert at Madison Square Garden, New York, at which he was joined in playing his songs and those of his guests, Lou Reed, Dave Grohl and the Foo Fighters, Robert Smith of the Cure, Billy Corgan of the Smashing Pumpkins, Black Francis of the Pixies, and Sonic Youth.

Incorporating experiments in British jungle and drum 'n' bass, Earthling (1997) was a critical and commercial success in the UK and the US, and two singles from the album — ""Little Wonder"" and ""Dead Man Walking"" — became UK Top 40 hits. Bowie's song ""I'm Afraid of Americans"" from the Paul Verhoeven film Showgirls was re-recorded for the album, and remixed by Trent Reznor for a single release. The heavy rotation of the accompanying video, also featuring Trent Reznor, contributed to the song's 16-week stay in the US Billboard Hot 100. Reznor also executive produced the Lost Highway soundtrack (1997) which begins and ends with different mixes of Bowie's Outside song ""I'm Deranged"". Bowie received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on 12 February 1997. The Earthling Tour took place in Europe and North America between June and November 1997. In November 1997, Bowie performed on the BBC's Children in Need charity single ""Perfect Day"", which reached number one in the UK. Bowie reunited with Visconti in 1998 to record ""(Safe in This) Sky Life"" for The Rugrats Movie. Although the track was edited out of the final cut, it was later re-recorded and released as ""Safe"" on the B-side of Bowie's 2002 single ""Everyone Says 'Hi'. The reunion led to other collaborations including a limited-edition single release version of Placebo's track ""Without You I'm Nothing"", co-produced by Visconti, with Bowie's harmonised vocal added to the original recording.

1999–2012: Neoclassicist era

Bowie, with Gabrels, created the soundtrack for Omikron: The Nomad Soul, a 1999 computer game in which he and Iman also voiced characters based on their likenesses. Released the same year and containing re-recorded tracks from Omikron, his album Hours featured a song with lyrics by the winner of his ""Cyber Song Contest"" Internet competition, Alex Grant. Making extensive use of live instruments, the album was Bowie's exit from heavy electronica. Hours and a performance on VH1 Storytellers in mid-1999 represented the end of Gabrels' association with Bowie as a performer and songwriter. Sessions for the planned album Toy, intended to feature new versions of some of Bowie's earliest pieces as well as three new songs, commenced in 2000, but the album remained officially unreleased until 2021. Bowie and Visconti continued their collaboration, producing a new album of completely original songs instead: the result of the sessions was the 2002 album Heathen.

On 25 June 2000, Bowie made his second appearance at the Glastonbury Festival in England, playing 30 years after his first. The performance was released as a posthumous live album in November 2018. On 27 June, Bowie performed a concert at the BBC Radio Theatre in London, which was released on the compilation album Bowie at the Beeb; this also featured BBC recording sessions from 1968 to 1972. Bowie and Iman's daughter was born on 15 August. His interest in Buddhism led him to support the Tibetan cause by performing at the February 2001 and February 2003 concerts to support Tibet House US at Carnegie Hall in New York.

In October 2001, Bowie opened the Concert for New York City, a charity event to benefit the victims of the September 11 attacks, with a minimalist performance of Simon & Garfunkel's ""America"", followed by a full band performance of ""Heroes"". 2002 saw the release of Heathen, and, during the second half of the year, the Heathen Tour. Taking place in Europe and North America, the tour opened at London's annual Meltdown festival, for which Bowie was that year appointed artistic director. Among the acts he selected for the festival were Philip Glass, Television, and the Dandy Warhols. As well as songs from the new album, the tour featured material from Bowie's Low era. Reality (2003) followed, and its accompanying world tour, the A Reality Tour, with an estimated attendance of 722,000, grossed more than any other in 2004. On 13 June, Bowie headlined the last night of the Isle of Wight Festival 2004, his final live show in the UK. On 25 June, he suffered chest pain while performing at the Hurricane Festival in Scheeßel, Germany. Originally thought to be a pinched nerve in his shoulder, the pain was later diagnosed as an acutely blocked coronary artery, requiring an emergency angioplasty in Hamburg. The remaining 14 dates of the tour were cancelled.

In the years following his recuperation from the heart attack, Bowie reduced his musical output, making only one-off appearances on stage and in the studio. He sang in a duet of his 1971 song ""Changes"" with Butterfly Boucher for the 2004 animated film Shrek 2. During a relatively quiet 2005, he recorded the vocals for the song ""(She Can) Do That"", co-written with Brian Transeau, for the film Stealth. He returned to the stage on 8 September 2005, appearing with Arcade Fire for the US nationally televised event Fashion Rocks, and performed with the Canadian band for the second time a week later during the CMJ Music Marathon. He contributed backing vocals on TV on the Radio's song ""Province"" for their album Return to Cookie Mountain, and joined with Lou Reed on Danish alt-rockers Kashmir's 2005 album No Balance Palace.

Bowie was awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award on 8 February 2006. In April, he announced, ""I'm taking a year off—no touring, no albums."" He made a surprise guest appearance at David Gilmour's 29 May concert at the Royal Albert Hall in London. The event was recorded, and a selection of songs on which he had contributed joint vocals were subsequently released. He performed again in November, alongside Alicia Keys, at the Black Ball, a benefit event for Keep a Child Alive at the Hammerstein Ballroom in New York. The performance marked the last time Bowie performed his music on stage.

Bowie was chosen to curate the 2007 High Line Festival. The musicians and artists he selected for the Manhattan event included electronic pop duo AIR, surrealist photographer Claude Cahun and English comedian Ricky Gervais. Bowie performed on Scarlett Johansson's 2008 album of Tom Waits covers, Anywhere I Lay My Head. In June 2008 a live album was released of a Ziggy Stardust-era concert from 1972. On the 40th anniversary of the July 1969 moon landing—and Bowie's accompanying commercial breakthrough with ""Space Oddity""—EMI released the individual tracks from the original eight-track studio recording of the song, in a 2009 contest inviting members of the public to create a remix. A Reality Tour, a double album of live material from the 2003 concert tour, was released in January 2010.

In late March 2011, Toy, Bowie's previously unreleased album from 2001, was leaked onto the internet, containing material used for Heathen and most of its single B-sides, as well as unheard new versions of his early back catalogue.

2013–2016: Final years
On 8 January 2013, his 66th birthday, his website announced a new album, to be titled The Next Day and scheduled for release in March. Bowie's first studio album in a decade, The Next Day contains 14 songs plus 3 bonus tracks. His website acknowledged the length of his hiatus. Producer and longtime collaborator Tony Visconti said 29 tracks were recorded for the album, some of which could appear on Bowie's next record, which he might start work on later in 2013. The announcement was accompanied by the immediate release of a single, ""Where Are We Now?"", written and recorded by Bowie in New York and produced by Visconti.

A music video for ""Where Are We Now?"" was released onto Vimeo the same day, directed by New York artist Tony Oursler. The single topped the UK iTunes Chart within hours of its release, and debuted in the UK Singles Chart at number six, his first single to enter the Top 10 for two decades (since ""Jump They Say"" in 1993).  A second video, ""The Stars (Are Out Tonight)"", was released 25 February. Directed by Floria Sigismondi, it stars Bowie and Tilda Swinton as a married couple. On 1 March, the album was made available to stream for free through iTunes. The Next Day debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart, was his first album to achieve that position since Black Tie White Noise (1993), and was the fastest-selling album of 2013 at the time. The music video for the song ""The Next Day"" created some controversy, initially being removed from YouTube for terms-of-service violation, then restored with a warning recommending viewing only by those 18 or over.

According to The Times, Bowie ruled out ever giving an interview again. Later in 2013, Bowie was featured in a cameo vocal in the Arcade Fire song ""Reflektor"". A poll carried out by BBC History Magazine, in October 2013, named Bowie as the best-dressed Briton in history. In mid-2014, Bowie was diagnosed with liver cancer, a diagnosis he kept private. New information was released in September 2014 regarding his next compilation album, Nothing Has Changed, which was released in November. The album featured rare tracks and old material from his catalogue in addition to a new song titled ""Sue (Or in a Season of Crime)"". In May 2015, ""Let's Dance"" was announced to be reissued as a yellow vinyl single on 16 July 2015 in conjunction with the David Bowie Is exhibition at the Australian Centre for the Moving Image in Melbourne, Australia.

In August 2015, it was announced that Bowie was writing songs for a Broadway musical based on the SpongeBob SquarePants cartoon series. Bowie wrote and recorded the opening title song to the television series The Last Panthers, which aired in November 2015. The theme that was used for The Last Panthers was also the title track for his January 2016 release Blackstar which is said to take cues from his earlier krautrock-influenced work. According to The Times: ""Blackstar may be the oddest work yet from Bowie"". On 7 December 2015, Bowie's musical Lazarus debuted in New York. His last public appearance was at opening night of the production.

Blackstar was released on 8 January 2016, Bowie's 69th birthday, and was met with critical acclaim. Following his death on 10 January, Visconti revealed that Bowie had planned the album to be his swan song, and a ""parting gift"" for his fans before his death. Several reporters and critics subsequently noted that most of the lyrics on the album seem to revolve around his impending death, with CNN noting that the album ""reveals a man who appears to be grappling with his own mortality"". Visconti later said that Bowie had been planning a post-Blackstar album, and had written and recorded demo versions of five songs in his final weeks, suggesting that Bowie believed he had a few months left. The day following his death, online viewing of Bowie's music skyrocketed, breaking the record for Vevo's most viewed artist in a single day. On 15 January, Blackstar debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart; nineteen of his albums were in the UK Top 100 Albums Chart, and thirteen singles were in the UK Top 100 Singles Chart. Blackstar also debuted at number one on album charts around the world, including Australia, France, Germany, Italy, New Zealand, and the US Billboard 200.

2016–present: Posthumous releases
In September 2016, a box set Who Can I Be Now? (1974–1976) was released covering Bowie's mid-1970s soul period; it included The Gouster, a previously unreleased 1974 album. An EP, No Plan, was released on 8 January 2017, which would have been Bowie's 70th birthday. Apart from ""Lazarus"", the EP includes three songs that Bowie recorded during the Blackstar sessions, but were left off the album and appeared on the soundtrack album for the Lazarus musical in October 2016. A music video for the title track was also released. 2017 and 2018 also saw the release of a series of posthumous live albums, covering the Diamond Dogs tour of 1974, the Isolar tour of 1976 and the Isolar II tour of 1978. In the two years following his death, Bowie sold 5 million records in the UK alone. In their top 10 list for the Global Recording Artist of the Year, the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry named Bowie the second-bestselling artist worldwide in 2016, behind Drake.

At the 59th Annual Grammy Awards in 2017, Bowie won all five nominated awards: Best Rock Performance; Best Alternative Music Album; Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical; Best Recording Package; and Best Rock Song. They were Bowie's first Grammy wins in musical categories. On 8 January 2020, on what would have been Bowie's 73rd birthday, a previously unreleased version of ""The Man Who Sold the World"" was released and two releases were announced: a streaming-only EP, Is It Any Wonder?, and an album, ChangesNowBowie, released in November 2020 for Record Store Day. In August 2020, another series of live shows were released, including sets from Dallas in 1995 and Paris in 1999. These and other shows, part of a series of live concerts spanning his tours from 1995 to 1999, was released in late 2020 and early 2021 as part of the box set Brilliant Live Adventures. In September 2021, Bowie's estate signed a distribution deal with Warner Music Group, beginning in 2023, covering Bowie's recordings from 2000 through 2016. Bowie's album Toy, recorded in 2001, was released on what would have been Bowie's 75th birthday. On 3 January 2022, Variety reported that Bowie's estate had sold his publishing catalogue to Warner Chappell Music, ""for a price upwards of $250 million"".

Acting career

While always primarily a musician, Bowie took acting roles throughout his career, appearing in over 30 films, television shows and theatrical productions. Bowie's acting career was ""productively selective"", largely eschewing starring roles for cameos and supporting parts. Many critics have observed that, had Bowie not chosen to pursue music, he could have found great success as an actor. Other critics have noted that, while his screen presence was singular, his best contributions to film were the use of his songs in films such as Lost Highway, A Knight's Tale, The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou and Inglourious Basterds.

1960s and 1970s 
The beginnings of Bowie's acting career predate his commercial breakthrough as a musician. Studying avant-garde theatre and mime under Lindsay Kemp, he was given the role of Cloud in Kemp's 1967 theatrical production Pierrot in Turquoise (later made into the 1970 television film The Looking Glass Murders). Bowie filmed a walk-on role for the BBC drama series Theater 625 that aired in May 1968. In the black-and-white short The Image (1969), he played a ghostly boy who emerges from a troubled artist's painting to haunt him. The same year, the film of Leslie Thomas's 1966 comic novel The Virgin Soldiers saw Bowie make a brief appearance as an extra.

In 1976, Bowie earned acclaim for his first major film role, portraying Thomas Jerome Newton, an alien from a dying planet, in The Man Who Fell to Earth, directed by Nicolas Roeg. He later admitted that his severe cocaine use during the film's production left him in such a fragile state of mind that he barely understood the film. Just a Gigolo (1979), an Anglo-German co-production directed by David Hemmings, saw Bowie in the lead role as Prussian officer Paul von Przygodski, who, returning from World War I, is discovered by a Baroness (Marlene Dietrich) and put into her gigolo stable. The film was a critical and commercial bomb, and Bowie later expressed embarrassment at his role in it.

1980s 

Bowie played Joseph Merrick in the Broadway theatre production The Elephant Man, which he undertook wearing no stage make-up, and which earned high praise for his expressive performance. He played the part 157 times between 1980 and 1981. Christiane F. – We Children from Bahnhof Zoo, a 1981 biographical film focusing on a young girl's drug addiction in West Berlin, featured Bowie in a cameo appearance as himself at a concert in Germany. Its soundtrack album, Christiane F. (1981), featured much material from his Berlin Trilogy albums. In 1982, he starred in the titular role in a BBC adaptation of the Bertolt Brecht play Baal. Bowie portrayed a vampire in Tony Scott's erotic horror film The Hunger (1983), with Catherine Deneuve and Susan Sarandon. In Nagisa Oshima's film the same year, Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence, based on Laurens van der Post's novel The Seed and the Sower, Bowie played Major Jack Celliers, a prisoner of war in a Japanese internment camp. Bowie had a cameo in Yellowbeard, a 1983 pirate comedy created by Monty Python members and directed by Mel Damski.

To promote the single ""Blue Jean"", Bowie filmed the 21 minute short film Jazzin' for Blue Jean (1984) with director Julien Temple, and played the dual roles of romantic protagonist Vic and arrogant rock star Screaming Lord Byron. The short won Bowie his only non-posthumous Grammy award. Bowie had a supporting role as hitman Colin in the 1985 John Landis film Into the Night. He declined to play the villain Max Zorin in the James Bond film A View to a Kill (1985). Bowie reteamed with Temple for Absolute Beginners (1986), a rock musical film adapted from Colin MacInnes's book of the same name about life in late 1950s London, in a supporting role as ad man Vendice Partners. The same year, Jim Henson's dark musical fantasy Labyrinth cast him as Jareth, the villainous Goblin King. Despite initial poor box office, the film grew in popularity and became a cult film. Two years later, he played Pontius Pilate in Martin Scorsese's critically acclaimed biblical epic The Last Temptation of Christ (1988).

1990s 
In 1991, Bowie reteamed with director John Landis for an episode of the HBO sitcom Dream On and played a disgruntled restaurant employee opposite Rosanna Arquette in The Linguini Incident. Bowie portrayed the mysterious FBI agent Phillip Jeffries in David Lynch's Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me (1992). The prequel to the television series was poorly received at the time of its release, but has since been critically reevaluated. He took a small but pivotal role as his friend Andy Warhol in Basquiat, artist/director Julian Schnabel's 1996 biopic of Jean-Michel Basquiat, another artist he considered a friend and colleague. Bowie co-starred in Giovanni Veronesi's Spaghetti Western Il Mio West (1998, released as Gunslinger's Revenge in the US in 2005) as the most feared gunfighter in the region. He played the aging gangster Bernie in Andrew Goth's Everybody Loves Sunshine (1999, released in the US as B.U.S.T.E.D.), and appeared as the host in the second season of the television horror anthology series The Hunger. Despite having several episodes which focus on vampires and Bowie's involvement, the show had no plot connection to the 1983 film of the same name. In 1999, Bowie voiced two characters in the Sega Dreamcast game Omikron: The Nomad Soul, his only appearance in a video game.

2000s and posthumous notes 
In Mr. Rice's Secret (2000), Bowie played the title role as the neighbour of a terminally ill 12-year-old. Bowie appeared as himself in the 2001 Ben Stiller comedy Zoolander, judging a ""walk-off"" between rival male models, and in Eric Idle's 2002 mockumentary The Rutles 2: Can't Buy Me Lunch. In 2005, he filmed a commercial with Snoop Dogg for XM Satellite Radio. Bowie portrayed a fictionalized version of physicist and inventor Nikola Tesla in Christopher Nolan's film The Prestige (2006), which was about the bitter rivalry between two magicians in the late 19th century. Nolan later claimed that Bowie was his only preference to play Tesla, and that he personally appealed to Bowie to take the role after he initially passed. In the same year, he voice-acted in Luc Besson's animated film Arthur and the Invisibles as the powerful villain Maltazard, and appeared as himself in an episode of the Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant television series Extras. In 2007, he lent his voice to the character Lord Royal Highness in the SpongeBob's Atlantis SquarePantis television film. In the 2008 film August, directed by Austin Chick, he played a supporting role as Ogilvie, a ""ruthless venture capitalist."" Bowie's final film appearance was a cameo as himself in the 2009 teen comedy Bandslam.

In a 2017 interview with Consequence of Sound, director Denis Villeneuve revealed his intention to cast Bowie in Blade Runner 2049 as the lead villain, Niander Wallace, but when news broke of Bowie's death in January of the same year, Villeneuve was forced to look for talent with similar ""rock star"" qualities. He eventually cast actor and lead singer of Thirty Seconds to Mars, Jared Leto. Talking about the casting process, Villeneuve said: ""Our first thought [for the character] had been David Bowie, who had influenced Blade Runner in many ways. When we learned the sad news, we looked around for someone like that. He [Bowie] embodied the Blade Runner spirit."" David Lynch also hoped to have Bowie reprise his Fire Walk With Me character for Twin Peaks: The Return but Bowie's illness prevented this. His character was portrayed via archival footage. At Bowie's request, Lynch overdubbed Bowie's original dialogue with a different actor's voice, as Bowie was unhappy with his Cajun accent in the original film.

Other works

Painter and art collector

Bowie was a painter and artist. He moved to Switzerland in 1976, purchasing a chalet in the hills to the north of Lake Geneva. In the new environment, his cocaine use decreased and he found time for other pursuits outside his musical career. He devoted more time to his painting, and produced a number of post-modernist pieces. When on tour, he took to sketching in a notebook, and photographing scenes for later reference. Visiting galleries in Geneva and the Brücke Museum in Berlin, Bowie became, in the words of Sandford, ""a prolific producer and collector of contemporary art. ... Not only did he become a well-known patron of expressionist art: locked in Clos des Mésanges he began an intensive self-improvement course in classical music and literature, and started work on an autobiography.""

One of Bowie's paintings sold at auction in late 1990 for $500, and the cover for his 1995 album Outside is a close-up of a self-portrait (from a series of five) he painted that same year. His first solo show, titled New Afro/Pagan and Work: 1975–1995, was in 1995 at The Gallery in Cork Street, London. He was invited to join the editorial board of the journal Modern Painters in 1998, and participated in the Nat Tate art hoax later that year. In 1998, during an interview with Michael Kimmelman for The New York Times, he said ""Art was, seriously, the only thing I'd ever wanted to own."" Subsequently, in a 1999 interview for the BBC, he said ""The only thing I buy obsessively and addictively is art"". His art collection, which included works by Damien Hirst, Derek Boshier, Frank Auerbach, Henry Moore, and Jean-Michel Basquiat among others, was valued at over £10m in mid-2016.

After his death, his family decided to sell most of the collection because they ""didn't have the space"" to store it. On 10 and 11 November, three auctions were held at Sotheby's in London, first with 47 lots and second with 208 paintings, drawings, and sculptures, third with 100 design lots. The items on sale represented about 65 percent of the collection. Exhibition of the works in the auction attracted 51,470 visitors, the auction itself was attended by 1,750 bidders, with over 1,000 more bidding online. The auctions has overall sale total £32.9 million (app. $41.5 million), while the highest-selling item, Basquiat's graffiti-inspired painting Air Power, sold for £7.09 million.

Bowie Bonds

""Bowie Bonds"", the first modern example of celebrity bonds, were asset-backed securities of current and future revenues of the 25 albums (287 songs) that Bowie recorded before 1990. Issued in 1997, the bonds were bought for US$55 million by the Prudential Insurance Company of America. Royalties from the 25 albums generated the cash flow that secured the bonds' interest payments. By forfeiting 10 years worth of royalties, Bowie received a payment of US$55 million up front. Bowie used this income to buy songs owned by his former manager, Tony Defries. The bonds liquidated in 2007 and the rights to the income from the songs reverted to Bowie.

BowieNet
In September 1998, Bowie launched an Internet service provider, BowieNet, developed in conjunction with Robert Goodale and Ron Roy. Subscribers to the dial-up service were offered exclusive content as well as a BowieNet email address and Internet access. The service was closed by 2006.

Legacy and influence 

Bowie's songs and stagecraft brought a new dimension to popular music in the early 1970s, strongly influencing both its immediate forms and its subsequent development. Bowie was a pioneer of glam rock, according to music historians Schinder and Schwartz, who credited Bowie and Marc Bolan with creating the genre. At the same time, he inspired the innovators of the punk rock music movement. When punk musicians were ""noisily reclaiming the three-minute pop song in a show of public defiance"", biographer David Buckley wrote that ""Bowie almost completely abandoned traditional rock instrumentation."" Bowie's record company promoted his unique status in popular music with the slogan, ""There's old wave, there's new wave, and there's David Bowie"".

Musicologist James Perone credited Bowie with having ""brought sophistication to rock music"", and critical reviews frequently acknowledged the intellectual depth of his work and influence. The BBC's arts editor Will Gompertz likened Bowie to Pablo Picasso, writing that he was ""an innovative, visionary, restless artist who synthesised complex avant garde concepts into beautifully coherent works that touched the hearts and minds of millions"".

Broadcaster John Peel contrasted Bowie with his progressive rock contemporaries, arguing that Bowie was ""an interesting kind of fringe figure... on the outskirts of things"". Peel said he ""liked the idea of him reinventing himself... the one distinguishing feature about early-70s progressive rock was that it didn't progress. Before Bowie came along, people didn't want too much change"". Buckley called the era ""bloated, self-important, leather-clad, self-satisfied""; then Bowie ""subverted the whole notion of what it was to be a rock star"".

Buckley called Bowie ""both star and icon. The vast body of work he has produced ... has created perhaps the biggest cult in popular culture. ... His influence has been unique in popular culture—he has permeated and altered more lives than any comparable figure.""

Through continual reinvention, his influence broadened and extended. Biographer Thomas Forget added, ""Because he has succeeded in so many different styles of music, it is almost impossible to find a popular artist today that has not been influenced by David Bowie."" In 2000, Bowie was voted by other music stars as the ""most influential artist of all time"" in a poll by NME. Alexis Petridis of The Guardian wrote that Bowie was confirmed by 1980 to be ""the most important and influential artist since the Beatles"". Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph stated that Bowie had ""one of the supreme careers in popular music, art and culture of the 20th century"" and ""he was too inventive, too mercurial, too strange for all but his most devoted fans to keep up with"". The BBC's Mark Easton argued that Bowie provided fuel for ""the creative powerhouse that Britain has become"" by challenging future generations ""to aim high, to be ambitious and provocative, to take risks"". Easton concluded that Bowie had ""changed the way the world sees Britain. And the way Britain sees itself"". In 2006, Bowie was voted the fourth greatest living British icon in a poll held by the BBC's Culture Show. Annie Zaleski of Alternative Press wrote, ""Every band or solo artist who's decided to rip up their playbook and start again owes a debt to Bowie"".

Numerous figures from the music industry whose careers Bowie had influenced paid tribute to him following his death; panegyrics on Twitter (tweets about him peaked at 20,000 a minute an hour after the announcement of his death) also came from outside the entertainment industry and pop culture, such as those from the Vatican, namely Cardinal Gianfranco Ravasi, who quoted ""Space Oddity"", and the Federal Foreign Office, which thanked Bowie for his part in the fall of the Berlin Wall and referenced ""Heroes"".

Belgian amateur astronomers at the MIRA Public Observatory in conjunction with Studio Brussel created a ""Bowie asterism"" in homage to Bowie in January 2016; it depicts the lightning bolt of Aladdin Sane using the stars Sigma Librae, Spica, Zeta Centauri, SAO 204132, Sigma Octantis, SAO 241641 and Beta Trianguli Australis which were near Mars at the time of Bowie's death.

On 7 January 2017, the BBC broadcast the 90-minute documentary David Bowie: The Last Five Years. On 8 January 2017, which would have been Bowie's 70th birthday, a charity concert in his birthplace of Brixton was hosted by actor Gary Oldman, a close friend. A David Bowie walking tour through Brixton was also launched, and other events marking his birthday weekend included concerts in New York, Los Angeles, Sydney, and Tokyo.

On 6 February 2018, the maiden flight of the SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket carried Elon Musk's personal Tesla Roadster and a mannequin affectionately named Starman into space. ""Space Oddity"" and ""Life on Mars?"" were looping on the car's sound system during the launch.

David Bowie Is

An exhibition of Bowie artefacts, called David Bowie Is, was organised by the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, and shown there in 2013. The London exhibit was visited by over 300,000 people, making it one of the most successful exhibitions ever staged at the museum. Later that year the exhibition began a world tour which started in Toronto and included stops in Chicago, Paris, Melbourne, Groningen and Brooklyn, New York where the exhibit ended in 2018 at the Brooklyn Museum. The exhibition hosted around 2,000,000 visitors over the entire course of its run.

Stardust biopic 

A biopic, Stardust, was announced on 31 January 2019, with musician and actor Johnny Flynn as Bowie, Jena Malone as his wife Angie, and Marc Maron as his publicist. The film follows Bowie on his first trip to the United States in 1971. The film was written by Christopher Bell and directed by Gabriel Range. Bowie's son Duncan Jones spoke out against the film, saying he was not consulted and that the film would not have permission to use Bowie's music. The film was set to premiere at the 2020 Tribeca Film Festival, but the festival was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It received generally unfavourable reviews from critics.

Moonage Daydream

A film based on Bowie's musical journey throughout his career was announced on 23 May 2022. Titled Moonage Daydream, after the song of the same name, the film is written and directed by Brett Morgen and will feature never-before-seen footage, performances and music and led by Bowie's own narration. Morgan stated that ""Bowie cannot be defined, he can be experienced... That is why we crafted 'Moonage Daydream' to be a unique cinematic experience."" The documentary is the first posthumous film about Bowie to be approved by his estate. After spending five years in production, the film premiered at the 2022 Cannes Film Festival before releasing on HBO Max in the spring of 2023.

Musicianship

From the time of his earliest recordings in the 1960s, Bowie employed a wide variety of musical styles. His early compositions and performances were strongly influenced by rock and roll singers like Little Richard and Elvis Presley, and also the wider world of show business. He particularly strove to emulate the British musical theatre singer-songwriter and actor Anthony Newley, whose vocal style he frequently adopted, and made prominent use of for his 1967 debut release, David Bowie (to the disgust of Newley himself, who destroyed the copy he received from Bowie's publisher). Bowie's fascination with music hall continued to surface sporadically alongside such diverse styles as hard rock and heavy metal, soul, psychedelic folk, and pop.

Musicologist James Perone observes Bowie's use of octave switches for different repetitions of the same melody, exemplified in his commercial breakthrough single, ""Space Oddity"", and later in the song ""Heroes"" to dramatic effect; Perone notes that ""in the lowest part of his vocal register ... his voice has an almost crooner-like richness.""

Voice instructor Jo Thompson describes Bowie's vocal vibrato technique as ""particularly deliberate and distinctive"". Schinder and Schwartz call him ""a vocalist of extraordinary technical ability, able to pitch his singing to particular effect."" Here, too, as in his stagecraft and songwriting, Bowie's roleplaying is evident: historiographer Michael Campbell says that Bowie's lyrics ""arrest our ear, without question. But Bowie continually shifts from person to person as he delivers them ... His voice changes dramatically from section to section."" In addition to the guitar, Bowie also played a variety of keyboards, including piano, Mellotron, Chamberlin, and synthesisers; harmonica; alto and baritone saxophones; stylophone; viola; cello; koto (in the ""Heroes"" track ""Moss Garden""); thumb piano; drums (on the Heathen track ""Cactus""), and various percussion instruments.

Personal life

Early relationships
Bowie met dancer Lindsay Kemp in 1967 and enrolled in his dance class at the London Dance Centre. He commented in 1972 that meeting Kemp was when his interest in image ""really blossomed"". ""He lived on his emotions, he was a wonderful influence. His day-to-day life was the most theatrical thing I had ever seen, ever. It was everything I thought Bohemia probably was. I joined the circus."" In January 1968, Kemp choreographed a dance scene for a BBC play, The Pistol Shot, in the Theatre 625 series, and used Bowie with a dancer, Hermione Farthingale; the pair began dating and moved into a London flat together. Bowie and Farthingale broke up in early 1969 when she went to Norway to take part in a film, Song of Norway; this affected him, and several songs, such as ""Letter to Hermione"" and ""Life on Mars?"", reference her; and, for the video accompanying ""Where Are We Now?"", he wore a T-shirt with the words ""m/s Song of Norway"". They were last together in January 1969 for the filming of Love You till Tuesday, a 30-minute film that was not released until 1984: intended as a promotional vehicle, it featured performances from Bowie's repertoire, including ""Space Oddity"", which had not been released when the film was made.

In 2015, ""baby groupie"" Lori Mattix (also known as Lori Maddox) gave an interview with Thrillist in which she made allegations of losing her virginity in the 1970's to Bowie, which would have occurred while she was underage and while the musician was in his twenties. In light of the Me Too movement four decades later, their relationship attracted renewed attention. Mattix also had a well documented relationship with Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page at that time which has also renewed similar attention.

Family

Bowie married his first wife, Mary Angela Barnett, on 19 March 1970 at Bromley Register Office in Bromley, London. They had an open marriage. Angela described their union as a marriage of convenience. ""We got married so that I could [get a permit to] work. I didn't think it would last and David said, before we got married, 'I'm not really in love with you' and I thought that's probably a good thing"", she said. Bowie said about Angela that ""living with her is like living with a blow torch."" Their son Duncan, born on 30 May 1971, was at first known as Zowie. Bowie and Angela divorced on 8 February 1980 in Switzerland. Bowie received custody of their son. After the gag order that was part of their divorce agreement ended, Angela wrote Backstage Passes: Life on the Wild Side with David Bowie, a memoir of their turbulent marriage.

On 24 April 1992, Bowie married Somali-American model Iman in a private ceremony in Lausanne. The wedding was later solemnised on 6 June in Florence. The couple's marriage influenced the content of Bowie's 1993 album Black Tie White Noise, particularly on tracks such as ""The Wedding""/""The Wedding Song"" and ""Miracle Goodnight"". They had one daughter, Alexandria ""Lexi"" Zahra Jones, born in August 2000. The couple resided primarily in New York City and London as well as owning an apartment in Sydney's Elizabeth Bay and Britannia Bay House on the island of Mustique.

Sexuality
Bowie declared himself gay in an interview with Michael Watts for a 1972 issue of Melody Maker, coinciding with his campaign for stardom as Ziggy Stardust. According to Buckley, ""If Ziggy confused both his creator and his audience, a big part of that confusion centred on the topic of sexuality."" In a September 1976 interview with Playboy, however, Bowie said: ""It's true—I am a bisexual. But I can't deny that I've used that fact very well. I suppose it's the best thing that ever happened to me."" His first wife, Angie, supports his claim of bisexuality and alleges that Bowie had a relationship with Mick Jagger.

In a 1983 interview with Rolling Stone, Bowie said his public declaration of bisexuality was ""the biggest mistake I ever made"" and ""I was always a closet heterosexual."" On other occasions, he said his interest in homosexual and bisexual culture had been more a product of the times and the situation in which he found himself than of his own feelings.

Blender asked Bowie in 2002 whether he still believed his public declaration was his biggest mistake. After a long pause, he said, ""I don't think it was a mistake in Europe, but it was a lot tougher in America. I had no problem with people knowing I was bisexual. But I had no inclination to hold any banners nor be a representative of any group of people."" Bowie said he wanted to be a songwriter and performer rather than a headline for his bisexuality, and in ""puritanical"" America, ""I think it stood in the way of so much I wanted to do.""

Buckley wrote that Bowie ""mined sexual intrigue for its ability to shock"", and was probably ""never gay, nor even consistently actively bisexual"", instead experimenting ""out of a sense of curiosity and a genuine allegiance with the 'transgressional'."" Sandford said, according to Mary Finnigan—with whom Bowie had an affair in 1969—Bowie and his first wife Angie ""created their bisexual fantasy"". He wrote that Bowie ""made a positive fetish of repeating the quip that he and his wife had met while 'fucking the same bloke' ... Gay sex was always an anecdotal and laughing matter. That Bowie's actual tastes swung the other way is clear from even a partial tally of his affairs with women."" The BBC's Mark Easton wrote in 2016 that Britain was ""far more tolerant of difference"", and that gay rights (such as same-sex marriage) and gender equality would not have ""enjoyed the broad support they do today without Bowie's androgynous challenge all those years ago"".

Spirituality and religion
Over the years, Bowie made numerous references to religions and to his evolving spirituality. Beginning in 1967 from the influence of his brother, he became interested in Buddhism and considered becoming a Buddhist monk. After a few months' study at Tibet House in London, he was told by a Lama, ""You don't want to be Buddhist.... You should follow music."" By 1975, Bowie admitted, ""I felt totally, absolutely alone. And I probably was alone because I pretty much had abandoned God."" In his will, Bowie stipulated that he be cremated and his ashes scattered in Bali ""in accordance with the Buddhist rituals"".

After Bowie married Iman in a private ceremony in 1992, he said they knew that their ""real marriage, sanctified by God, had to happen in a church in Florence"". Earlier that year, he knelt on stage at The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert and recited the Lord's Prayer before a television audience. In 1993, Bowie said he had an ""undying"" belief in the ""unquestionable"" existence of God. In a separate 1993 interview, while describing the genesis of the music for his album Black Tie White Noise, he said "" … it was important for me to find something [musically] that also had no sort of representation of institutionalized and organized religion, of which I'm not a believer, I must make that clear."" Interviewed in 2005, Bowie said whether God exists ""is not a question that can be answered.... I'm not quite an atheist and it worries me. There's that little bit that holds on: 'Well, I'm almost an atheist. Give me a couple of months.... I've nearly got it right. He had a tattoo of the Serenity Prayer in Japanese on his left calf.

""Questioning [his] spiritual life [was] always ... germane"" to Bowie's songwriting. The song ""Station to Station"" is ""very much concerned with the Stations of the Cross""; the song also specifically references Kabbalah. Bowie called the album ""extremely dark... the nearest album to a magick treatise that I've written"". Earthling showed ""the abiding need in me to vacillate between atheism or a kind of gnosticism... What I need is to find a balance, spiritually, with the way I live and my demise."" Released shortly before his death, ""Lazarus""—from his final album, Blackstar—began with the words, ""Look up here, I'm in Heaven"" while the rest of the album deals with other matters of mysticism and mortality.

Politics
As a seventeen-year-old still known as Davy Jones, he was a cofounder and spokesman for the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Long-Haired Men in response to members of The Manish Boys being asked to cut their hair prior to a television appearance on the BBC. He and his bandmates were interviewed on the network's 12 November 1964 installment of Tonight to champion their cause. He stated on the programme, ""I think we all like long hair and we don't see why other people should persecute us because of it.""

In 1976, speaking as The Thin White Duke, Bowie's persona at the time, and ""at least partially tongue-in-cheek"", he made statements that expressed support for fascism and perceived admiration for Adolf Hitler in interviews with Playboy, NME, and a Swedish publication. Bowie was quoted as saying: ""Britain is ready for a fascist leader ... I think Britain could benefit from a fascist leader. After all, fascism is really nationalism... I believe very strongly in fascism, people have always responded with greater efficiency under a regimental leadership."" He was also quoted as saying: ""Adolf Hitler was one of the first rock stars"" and ""You've got to have an extreme right front come up and sweep everything off its feet and tidy everything up."" Bowie later retracted these comments in an interview with Melody Maker in October 1977, blaming them on mental instability caused by his drug problems at the time, saying: ""I was out of my mind, totally, completely crazed."" In the same interview, Bowie described himself as ""apolitical"", stating ""The more I travel and the less sure I am about exactly which political philosophies are commendable. The more government systems I see, the less enticed I am to give my allegiance to any set of people, so it would be disastrous for me to adopt a definitive point of view, or to adopt a party of people and say 'these are my people'.""

In the 1980s and 1990s, Bowie's public statements shifted sharply towards anti-racism and anti-fascism. In an interview with MTV anchor Mark Goodman in 1983, Bowie criticised the channel for not providing enough coverage of Black musicians, becoming visibly uncomfortable when Goodman suggested that the network's fear of backlash from the American Midwest was one reason for such a lack of coverage. The music videos for ""China Girl"" and ""Let's Dance"" were described by Bowie as a ""very simple, very direct"" statement against racism. The album Tin Machine took a more direct stance against fascism and neo-Nazism, and was criticised for being too preachy.

At the 2014 Brit Awards on 19 February, Bowie became the oldest recipient of a Brit Award in the ceremony's history when he won the award for British Male Solo Artist, which was collected on his behalf by Kate Moss. His speech read: ""I'm completely delighted to have a Brit for being the best male – but I am, aren't I Kate? Yes. I think it's a great way to end the day. Thank you very, very much and Scotland stay with us."" Bowie's reference to the forthcoming September 2014 Scottish independence referendum garnered a significant reaction throughout the UK on social media.

In 2016, filmmaker and activist Michael Moore said he had wanted to use ""Panic in Detroit"" for his 1998 documentary The Big One. Denied at first, Moore was given the rights after calling Bowie personally, recalling: ""I've read stuff since his death saying that he wasn't that political and he stayed away from politics. But that wasn't the conversation that I had with him.""

Philanthropy
Bowie was involved in philanthropic and charitable efforts for HIV/AIDS research in Africa, as well as other humanitarian projects helping disadvantaged children and developing nations, ending poverty and hunger, promoting human rights, and providing education and health care to children affected by war.

Death

On 10 January 2016, Bowie died of liver cancer in his New York City apartment. He had been diagnosed 18 months earlier but had not made his condition public. The Belgian theatre director Ivo van Hove, who had worked with Bowie on his off-Broadway musical Lazarus, explained that he was unable to attend rehearsals due to the progression of the disease. He noted that Bowie had kept working during the illness.

Visconti wrote:

Following Bowie's death, fans gathered at impromptu street shrines. At the mural of Bowie in his birthplace of Brixton, south London, which shows him in his Aladdin Sane character, fans laid flowers and sang his songs. Other memorial sites included Berlin, Los Angeles, and outside his apartment in New York. After news of his death, sales of his albums and singles soared. Bowie had insisted that he did not want a funeral, and according to his death certificate he was cremated in New Jersey on 12 January. As he wished in his will, his ashes were scattered in a Buddhist ceremony in Bali, Indonesia.

Awards and achievements

Bowie's 1969 commercial breakthrough, the song ""Space Oddity"", won him an Ivor Novello Special Award For Originality. For his performance in the 1976 science fiction film The Man Who Fell to Earth, he won a Saturn Award for Best Actor. In the ensuing decades he was honoured with numerous awards for his music and its accompanying videos, receiving, among others, six Grammy Awards and four Brit Awards—winning Best British Male Artist twice; the award for Outstanding Contribution to Music in 1996; and the Brits Icon award for his ""lasting impact on British culture"", given posthumously in 2016.

In 1999, Bowie was made a Commander of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French government. He received an honorary doctorate from Berklee College of Music the same year. He declined the royal honour of Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 2000, and turned down a knighthood in 2003. Bowie later stated ""I would never have any intention of accepting anything like that. I seriously don't know what it's for. It's not what I spent my life working for.""

During his lifetime, Bowie sold over 100 million records worldwide, making him one of the best-selling music artists. In the United Kingdom, he was awarded 9 platinum, 11 gold, and 8 silver albums, and in the United States, 5 platinum and 9 gold. Since 2015, Parlophone has remastered Bowie's back catalogue through the ""Era"" box set series, starting with Five Years (1969–1973). Bowie was announced as the best-selling vinyl artist of the 21st century in 2022.

Rolling Stones 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list includes The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars at number 40, Station to Station at number 52, Hunky Dory at number 88, Low at number 206, and Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps) at number 443. And, on their 500 Greatest Songs of All Time list, Rolling Stone includes ""Heroes"" at number 23, ""Life on Mars?"" at number 105, ""Space Oddity"" at number 189, ""Changes"" at number 200, ""Young Americans"" at number 204, ""Station to Station"" at number 400, and ""Under Pressure"" at number 429. Four of his songs are included in The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll. According to Acclaimed Music, he is the fourth most celebrated artist in popular music history.

In the BBC's 2002 poll of the 100 Greatest Britons, Bowie was ranked 29. In 2004, Rolling Stone magazine ranked him 39th on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. Bowie was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996 and into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2005. He was inducted into the Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame in 2013. Days after Bowie's death, Rolling Stone contributor Rob Sheffield proclaimed him ""the greatest rock star ever"". The magazine also listed him as the 39th greatest songwriter of all time.

In 2008, the spider Heteropoda davidbowie was named in Bowie's honour. In 2011, his image was chosen by popular vote for the B₤10m note of the local currency of his birthplace, the Brixton Pound. On 5 January 2015, a main-belt asteroid was named 342843 Davidbowie. On 13 January 2016, Belgian amateur astronomers at MIRA Public Observatory created a ""Bowie asterism"" of seven stars which had been in the vicinity of Mars at the time of Bowie's death; the ""constellation"" forms the lightning bolt on Bowie's face from the cover of his Aladdin Sane album. In March 2017, Bowie featured on a series of UK postage stamps issued by the Royal Mail. On 25 March 2018, a statue of Bowie was unveiled in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, the town where he debuted Ziggy Stardust. The statue features a likeness of Bowie in 2002 accompanied with various characters and looks from over his career, with Ziggy Stardust at the front.

5793,['951 died ( ) ( Yanzheng Wang ?'],"Wang Yanzheng () (died 951?), known as Tiande Emperor () after his era name of Tiande, formally Prince Gongyi of Fu (), also known during Min as the Prince of Fusha (), was the last ruler of the Chinese Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms Period state Min.  In 943, he, then in civil war with his brother Wang Yanxi (Emperor Jingzong), declared himself emperor of a new state of Yin at his base Jian Prefecture (建州, in modern Nanping, Fujian), but after Wang Yanxi was killed by the general Zhu Wenjin, who was himself assassinated thereafter, Wang Yanzheng reclaimed the title of Emperor of Min.  His reign would last less than three years overall, though, as Min's northwestern neighbor Southern Tang bore down militarily on him and forced his surrender, ending Min.

Background 
It is not known when Wang Yanzheng was born.  His father was Min's first ruler, Wang Shenzhi (Prince Zhongyi), but his mother's identity is not recorded in history.  Further, while his older brother Wang Yanxi (the third among his brothers to rule Min) was said to be Wang Shenzhi's 28th son, Wang Yanzheng's birth rank is also not recorded in history.  (However, as Wang Yanzheng was not mentioned on the tombstone of Wang Shenzhi's wife Lady Ren Neiming, he was likely born after Lady Ren's death in 918.)

The first reference to Wang Yanzheng in historical sources was in 931, when another older brother, Wang Yanjun, then ruling but carrying only the title of Prince of Min as a vassal of Later Tang, had defeated and executed their adoptive brother, Wang Yanbing, who had controlled the Jian Prefecture region and had tried to seize control of the Min state from Wang Yanjun.  After Wang Yanbing's death, Wang Yanjun sent Wang Yanzheng to Jian to try to comfort the people, and he later commissioned Wang Yanzheng as the prefect of Jian, a post that Wang Yanzheng then appeared to remain at for the next several years.

Service under and civil war with Wang Xi 
In 939, Wang Yanxi became Min's ruler (and changed his name to Wang Xi) after the prior emperor of Min, their nephew Wang Chang, had been overthrown and killed.  It was said that after taking the throne (using, at that time, the title of king), Wang Xi became arrogant and cruel, taking grudges out on people, including his clan members.  Wang Yanzheng wrote several letters to him urging him to change his behavior.  Wang Xi did not listen, and wrote back angry letters to rebuke Wang Yanzheng.  He also sent his close associate Ye Qiao () to monitor Wang Yanzheng's army, and the officer Du Hanchong () to monitor the nearby Nanzhen Base (南鎮, in modern Ningde, Fujian).  Ye and Du submitted numerous reports alleging misdeeds by Wang Yanzheng, exacerbating the suspicions between the brothers.  One day, Wang Yanzheng and Ye were discussing matters of governance, and it escalated into an argument.  Ye stated, ""Are you rebelling, Lord?""  Wang Yanzheng, in anger, tried to arrest and kill Ye.  Ye fled to Nanzhen.  Wang Yanzheng then attacked Nanzhen and defeated the central government-controlled army there.  Ye and Du fled back to Min's capital Fu Prefecture (福州, in modern Fuzhou, Fujian).  Wang Yanzheng then also defeated the other central government-controlled forces in the region.

In response, Wang Xi sent his generals Pan Shikui () and Wu Xingzhen () to attack Wang Yanzheng with 40,000 men.  Wang Yanzheng sought aid from Qian Yuanguan, the king of Min's northern neighbor Wuyue.  Qian sent the general Yang Renquan with 40,000 men to aid Wang Yanzheng.  Before Yang could arrive, though, Wang Yanzheng had already defeated the Min central government army, killing Pan and forcing Wu to flee.  Wang Yanzheng also used the opportunity to also capture the cities of Yongping () and Shunchang () (both in modern Nanping).  When Yang's army arrived, Wang Yanzheng tried to send him away by offering beef and wine to the troops, but Yang refused, instead setting his camp outside the city, posturing to get ready to besiege it.  In fear, Wang Yanzheng wrote Wang Xi, requesting aid.  Wang Xi sent their nephew Wang Jiye () with an army to aid him, and also wrote Qian to rebuke him and sent another army to cut off the Wuyue army's food supply route.  Once the Wuyue army's food supply ran out, Wang Yanzheng attacked, defeating it.  Yang then withdrew.  Subsequently, Li Jing, the emperor of Min's northwestern neighbor Southern Tang, sent the emissary Shang Quangong () to both Wang Xi and Wang Yanzheng, urging them to make peace with each other.  With Li Jing's moderation, Wang Yanzheng sent officers and female servants to submit a statement of oath and an incense censer to Wang Xi.  Subsequently, Wang Yanzheng's emissaries and Wang Xi swore an oath at their father Wang Shenzhi's tomb.  However, despite this oath, the suspicions between the brothers remained.

In 941, Wang Yanzheng fortified the defenses around Jian Prefecture, and he also requested Wang Xi make him the military governor of Weiwu Circuit (威武, traditionally headquartered at Fu, but Wang Yanzheng thus was proposing to have its capital moved to Jian).  Wang Xi, citing the fact that Weiwu's capital was traditionally at Fu, declined, but created a new circuit with its capital at Jian, making Wang Yanzheng its military governor.  However, the name that Wang Xi decreed — Zhen'an (鎮安, ""settled peace"") — was not to Wang Yanzheng's liking, so Wang Yanzheng renamed it Zhenwu (鎮武, ""settled military"").  Wang Xi also created him the Prince of Fusha — a title that the people of Min would subsequently refer to him as, even after he claimed imperial title.  Meanwhile, Wang Xi, suspecting that another brother, Wang Yanxi (王延喜, note different character than Wang Xi himself) the Prefect of Ting Prefecture (汀州, in modern Longyan, Fujian), was allying with Wang Yanzheng, sent the general Xu Renqin () to Ting, seizing Wang Yanxi and returning him to Fu.  Also suspecting Wang Jiye, who was then serving as the prefect of Quan Prefecture (泉州, in modern Quanzhou, Fujian), as Wang Yanzheng had written Wang Jiye, Wang Xi also recalled Wang Jiye and then ordered him to commit suicide.

Later in 941, Wang Xi claimed imperial title and resumed his campaign against Wang Yanzheng, but the battles were indecisive.  Historical accounts described the scene of the battlefields between Fu and Jian as being covered with human bones.  Wang Yanzheng's secretary Pan Chengyou suggested that he seek peace, but Wang Yanzheng refused.  Shortly after, he claimed the title of Generalissimo (兵馬元帥, Bingma Yuanshuai).

In 942, Wang Yanzheng attacked Ting and put it under siege.  Wang Xi launched armies from Quan and Zhang (漳州, in modern Zhangzhou, Fujian) to aid Ting, while launching another army, commanded by the generals Lin Shouliang (), Huang Jingzhong (), and Huang Shaopo (), to try to attack Jian in Wang Yanzheng's absence.  Wang Yanzheng's attacks on Ting were unsuccessful, but his generals Bao Hongshi () and Chen Wang () engaged and killed Huang Jingzhong.  Lin and Huang Shaopo fled back to Fu.  Wang Xi subsequently sent a personally-written edict, gold vessels, money, and 640 commissions for Wang Yanzheng's subordinates, to Wang Yanzheng, seeking peace.  Wang Yanzheng refused to receive the items.

As Emperor of Yin 
In 943, Wang Yanzheng declared himself emperor of a new state of Yin.  He created his wife Lady Zhang as empress, and commissioned Pan Chengyou and Yang Sigong as his chancellors.  However, it was said that while he wore the red robe of an emperor, in his embassies to neighboring states and receiving such embassies from them, he still used the ceremony only of a military governor.  Meanwhile, it was said that because the state is small but had large military expenditures, Yang received his favor by imposing heavy taxes on the people, on real property as well as even fish, salt, vegetables, and fruits, such that the resentful people referred to Yang as ""Yang the Skinner.""

In summer 943, Chen Wang attacked Fu Prefecture and advanced into the city through its west gate, but was eventually repelled and forced to withdraw.  Shortly later, Pan submitted a petition, pointing out 10 things that, in Pan's opinion, were problematic with Wang Yanzheng's rule of the Yin state:

 His battles against his brother Wang Xi.
 HIs heavy taxation and conscription of labor.
 His conscription of soldiers and giving them heavy war burdens.
 His allowing Yang's heavy taxations, causing resentment towards the emperor, but no other official dared to speak against Yang.
 His establishment of many prefectures and counties in his small state, leading to administrative waste.
 His concentrating on capturing Ting and thus not being concerned about possible attacks by Southern Tang and Wuyue.
 His seizure of assets from wealthy merchants, his selling offices to the rich, and the result that the poor were the only ones punished.
 His taxation of fruits, vegetables, fish, and rice at various river fords, gaining little in tax revenues and causing much resentment.
 His not sending emissaries to Southern Tang and Wuyue.
 His building of palaces and overexpenditures on decorating them.

In anger, Wang Yanzheng stripped Pan of his titles and forced him to retire to his mansion.

In 944, Yin minted large iron coins, with each large coin having the value of 100 small coins.

Shortly later, Li Jing sent letters to both Wang Xi and Wang Yanzheng, rebuking them for attacking each other.  Wang Xi wrote back, citing comparisons to the Duke of Zhou's killing of his rebellious brothers, the Lords of Guan and Cai, and to Emperor Taizong of Tang's killing of his brothers Li Jiancheng and Li Yuanji.  Wang Yanzheng, however, wrote back in a more disrespectful manner, instead rebuking Li Jing's father Li Bian's usurpation of the throne from Southern Tang's predecessor state Wu.  Li Jing, in anger, cut off relationships with Yin.

Later in 944, Wang Xi was assassinated by his generals Zhu Wenjin and Lian Chongyu.  Lian supported Zhu to be the new emperor of Min, and slaughtered the Wang clan members remaining at Fu Prefecture.  Hearing this, Wang Yanzheng sent the general Wu Chengyi () to attack Zhu, but was unsuccessful at that time.  Shortly after, however, the Quan Prefecture officers Liu Congxiao, Wang Zhongshun (), Dong Si'an (), and Zhang Hansi, assassinated Huang Shaopo, whom Zhu commissioned as Quan's prefect, and submitted to Yin, supporting Wang Yanzheng's nephew Wang Jixun () as acting prefect.  The Zhang Prefecture officer Cheng Mo () then assassinated the Zhu-commissioned prefect of Zhang, Cheng Wenwei (), as well, and supported another nephew of Wang Yanzheng's, Wang Jicheng (), as acting prefect.  Ting's prefect Xu Wenzhen () did so shortly after as well.

Zhu, faced with these prefectures' turning against him, sent the generals Lin Shouliang () and Li Ting'e () to attack Quan, and Wang Yanzheng sent the general Du Jin () to aid Liu in defending Quan.  Liu engaged Lin and Li, defeating Lin and capturing Li.  Wang Yanzheng then sent Wu to attack Fu again, and Zhu sought aid from Wuyue.  Meanwhile, the Southern Tang general Cha Wenhui () launched an attack on Jian, but when he heard that Zhang, Quan, and Ting had all submitted to Yin, he withdrew to Jianyang (建陽, in modern Nanping).

Hearing of the Southern Tang attack, though, Wu decided to use it to trick the people of Fu — declaring to them that, indeed, Southern Tang was aiding Yin in attacking the rebellious Zhu.  Zhu tried to sue for peace by sending his chancellor Li Guangzhun () to surrender the Min imperial seal to Wang Yanzheng.  However, before any further peace overtures could be made, the Fu officer Lin Renhan () led an uprising and killed both Lian and Zhu.  He then opened the city gates to welcome Wu in, and also offered Lian's and Zhu's heads to Wang Yanzheng.

As Emperor of Min 
The Min officials submitted petitions to Wang Yanzheng, urging him to change the name of the state back to Min and to return the capital to Fu.  Wang accepted the first proposal and claimed the title of Emperor of Min, but declined the second, due to the impending Southern Tang attack.  Rather, he made Fu the southern capital and sent his nephew Wang Jichang to defend it, while summoning the remaining imperial guards from Fu.

Meanwhile, at Cha Wenhui's request, Li Jing sent additional troops to reinforce his army to again prepare to attack Jian.  Wang sent Yang Sigong and Chen Wang to resist.  Chen initially took a defensive posture and set up his defense on a river, and the Southern Tang army did not dare to attack.  However, Yang, stating that it was Wang Yanzheng's order, insisted that Chen attack.  Chen was forced to attack the Southern Tang army, and fell into a trap set by the Southern Tang general Zu Quan'en ().  Chen was killed, and Yang was forced to flee back to Jian.  Hearing of this, Wang Yanzheng panicked, summoned additional troops from Quan (commanded by Dong Si'an and Wang Zhongshun) to reinforce Jian's defenses, and prepared for a siege.  It was said that the people of Jian, tired of the warfare among the Wang clan members and the heavy-handed rule imposed by Yang, were welcoming the Southern Tang army and opening roads for them.

At the same time, though, two officers at Fu, Li Renda and Chen Jixun (), both of whom had turned against Wang Yanzheng before, persuaded the general Huang Renfeng () into rising against Wang Yanzheng.  They assassinated Wang Jichang and Wu Chengyi, and declared the Buddhist monk Zhuo Yanming to be emperor.  Wang Yanzheng sent the general Zhang Hanzhen () to attack Zhuo's new regime, and, suspecting the loyalty of the Fu troops at Jian at that time, slaughtered them and used their flesh for food.  He also sent a petition offering to submit as a vassal to Wuyue, seeking its aid.  (Meanwhile, Li Renda first falsely accused Huang and Chen of preparing to rebel against Zhuo and had them killed, and then assassinated Zhuo himself, taking power and claiming the title of acting military governor of Weiwu, in nominal submission to both Southern Tang and Later Jin.)

By fall 945, Jian was in a desperate situation, and eventually, the city fell.  Wang Yanzheng surrendered, while Wang Zhongshun died in the battle and Dong took his army and fled back to Quan.

As Southern Tang subject 
Wang Yanzheng was delivered back to the Southern Tang capital Jinling.  Li Jing gave him a general title, while executing Yang Sigong per the popular sentiment of the people of Jian.  He also commissioned his general Wang Chongwen () to be the military governor of a newly established Yong'an Circuit (), headquartered at Jian, to rule over the former Min territory that Wang Yanzheng still held, including Ting, Quan, and Zhang Prefectures, each of which submitted to Southern Tang (for the time being).

In 947, Li commissioned Wang Yanzheng to be the military governor of Anhua Circuit (安化, headquartered in modern Shangrao, Jiangxi).  He also created Wang the Prince of Poyang.

In 951, Li commissioned Wang to be the military governor of Shannan West Circuit (山南西道, headquartered in modern Hanzhong, Shaanxi) — a completely honorary title as Shannan West was then under the rule of Later Shu.  He also created Wang the Prince of Guangshan.  It was said that Wang died not long after, implying that it was that year.  He was posthumously created the Prince of Fu, and given the posthumous name of Gongyi (恭懿, ""respectful and benevolent"").

5828,"['victims the protect will who , violence based - gender of forms other and rape of perpetrator the and rights human of abuser the is itself government the When "" , asks she , it In ?', 'tragedy their end will Who ?']","Nilar Thein (, ) (born 4 March 1972) is a Burmese democracy activist and political prisoner imprisoned from 2008 to 2012 at Thayet prison in Burma's Magway Region. Amnesty International considered her a prisoner of conscience.

8888 uprising and subsequent arrests
Nilar Thein is from Yangon, Burma. She and her future husband, Kyaw Min Yu (better known as ""Ko Jimmy""), participated in 1988's pro-democracy 8888 Uprising, opposing the continued rule of the military dictatorship State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC). In 1990, she was imprisoned for two months for her participation in protests. In December 1996, she was arrested for organizing protests and sentenced to ten years imprisonment, which she served at Thayawaddy prison. She reported being abused and sexually harassed by prison staff during this sentence, stating that ""under the prison chief, U Win Myint, prisoners sentenced for rape were kept next to the women’s building... Prison staff and these prisoners would come and peep at us while we took our baths."" She was released in 2003. In 2005, she married Kyaw Min Yu. At around the same time, she joined the newly formed 88 Generation Students Group.

Role in 2007 protests
In August 2007, anti-government protests (popularly known as the ""Saffron Revolution"" for the prominent involvement of Buddhist monks) broke out in Yangon in response to increasing fuel and commodity prices. As a part of the protests, Nilar Thein organized a march of roughly 500 people to protest government policies. When police began seeking the organizers of the protest, Nilar Thein went into hiding. Her husband had already been arrested on the night of 21 August and sent to Insein Prison.

In May, Nilar Thein had given birth to a baby girl, Phyu Nay Kyi Min Yu, and when hiding with the infant became too difficult, she left the child with in-laws. She then evaded capture for a little more than a year, changing locations and cell phone numbers frequently to avoid detection; she told a reporter that at one point in this period she escaped arrest in a rickshaw taxi. In March 2008, People in Need awarded Nilar Thein, along with political prisoners Su Su Nway and Phyu Phyu Thin, the Homo Homini Award. On 19 June 2008, Nilar Thein published an editorial in the English-language Thai newspaper The Nation, protesting the Burmese government's treatment of women and children. In it, she asks, ""When the government itself is the abuser of human rights and the perpetrator of rape and other forms of gender-based violence, who will protect the victims? Who will end their tragedy? Who will secure the joyful reunion of mothers with their children?""

Arrest, trial, and imprisonment

On 10 September 2008, Nilar Thein was arrested on her way to visit the mother of another political prisoner, Ant Bwe Kyaw, in Yangon. On 11 November, she and her husband were convicted along with fellow 88 Generation Students Group members Htay Kywe, Mie Mie, and ten other activists on four counts of ""illegally using electronic media"" and one count of ""forming an illegal organization"". At that time, all fourteen were serving 65-year sentences at Thayet prison.

In January 2009, her family heard secondhand information that she had developed a peptic ulcer and were concerned that her health might be deteriorating. In December 2010, Nilar Thein's family reported that prison officials had barred them from seeing her, even to bring Nilar Thein's child for a visit. Nilar Thein responded with a hunger strike.

Release

Nilar Thein and Ko Jimmy were released on 13 January 2012 in a mass presidential pardon of political prisoners. Speaking from outside the prison on the day of her release, she told The Irrawaddy that ""I’m happy, and I will be very happy to see my family. We will get involved in democratic reform with Auntie [Aung San Suu Kyi].""

Rohingya genocide
In September 2017—at the height of the Rohingya genocide (the violent persecution of Myanmar's chiefly-Muslim minority, the Rohingya) -- Nilar Thein had reportedly been photographed escorted by, and assisting, a group of apparent Tatmadaw soldiers, while touring the conflict region, Myanmar's Rakhine state. She was subsequently among a group of 88 Generation Peace and Open Society activists appearing at a press conference, 13 September 2017, at which they issued a written statement that denied the version of events depicted in prominent international media, and in which one of the group's principal figures issued a statement essentially siding with Myanmar's civilian government in its harsh treatment of the Rohingya community.

Musically, ""Naughty Girl"" is an R&B song that interpolates from Donna Summer's 1975 song ""Love to Love You Baby"". Influenced by Arabic music, dancehall, funk and reggae, the song contains lyrics that reference to a celebration of sexual lust and conquest, leading up to a desire for a one-night stand.

""Naughty Girl"" received positive feedback by music critics, who praised Beyoncé's assertive vocals and the song's sensual vibe. However, opinions about how convincingly Beyoncé was able to portray a naughty girl were polarized. The song was nominated in the category Best R&B/Soul Single by a Female Artist at the 2005 Soul Train Music Awards. ""Naughty Girl"" peaked at number three on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, becoming Beyoncé's fourth consecutive release from the album to reach the top-five on that chart. The single reached the top-ten in New Zealand, Australia, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. ""Naughty Girl"" was certified gold by the American and Australian trade associations of record producers.  It was also certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of New Zealand.

The song's accompanying music video was directed by Jake Nava and was inspired by the dancing of Cyd Charisse and Fred Astaire in the 1953 musical comedy film The Band Wagon. In it, Beyoncé flirtatiously and seductively dances with R&B singer Usher to portray a naughty girl. The video received four nominations at the 2004 MTV Video Music Awards and eventually won the Best Female Video accolade. The song was included on Beyoncé's set lists on her tours. The American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) recognized ""Naughty Girl"" as one of the most performed songs of 2005 at the ASCAP Pop Music Awards. ""Naughty Girl"" has been covered by singer-songwriter Roesy and band Richard Cheese and Lounge Against the Machine.

Background and release
After the release of her former group Destiny's Child's 2001 album, Survivor, Beyoncé began a solo career and recorded her debut solo album, Dangerously in Love (2003). Beyoncé stated that it is more personal than her previous records because she was writing for herself. She contacted Scott Storch, Robert Waller and her cousin and personal assistant Angela Beyincé; together, they composed ""Naughty Girl"" among many other songs. It was planned to be the lead single from the album, but ""Crazy in Love"" was eventually chosen. ""Naughty Girl"" was subsequently released as the fourth and final single by Columbia Records; it was serviced for airplay in the United States on March 14, 2004, under formats that included rhythmic contemporary and urban contemporary ones. The single was added to contemporary hit radios playlists on an unknown date.

""Naughty Girl"" was first released in the United Kingdom as a maxi single, which contained four tracks as well as a multimedia one, on April 5, 2004, and later as a CD single on May 18, 2004. In the US, it was later released as a 12"" single and a CD single on April 20, 2004. A different CD single was released in Australia on April 23, 2004; it included the album version and two remixes of the song (one of them featuring Lil' Kim), and Destiny's Child's song ""I Know"" from The Fighting Temptations soundtrack. ""Naughty Girl"" was also made available as a digital download in the same country on June 1, 2004. On April 26, 2004, it was released in Germany as a maxi single and different CD singles were additionally made available in its iTunes Store and on Amazon.com. The song was released as a digital EP in several European countries, including Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Switzerland, and Sweden in early May 2004. The same EP was also serviced in Canada and was exclusively released as a CD single in Switzerland on May 31, 2004. ""Naughty Girl"" was released as a download-only single in New Zealand on June 1, 2004.

Music and lyrics

According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Alfred Music Publishing, ""Naughty Girl"" is an R&B song based on the C-sharp Phrygian dominant scale. It is written in common time and moves at a moderate tempo of 100 beats per minute. Beyoncé's vocal range spans around one and a half octaves in the song, from B3 to F5. Storch and Beyoncé interpolated the refrain of the 1975 song ""Love to Love You Baby"", originally performed by Donna Summer and written by Summer, Pete Bellotte and Giorgio Moroder. Musically, ""Naughty Girl"" is influenced by Middle Eastern and Arabic music, resulting to an uptempo and disco-oriented sound. The song also displays dancehall as well as reggae influences, and is built on squiggling synth grooves weave.

According to Spence D. of IGN Music, Beyoncé's vocals on the song are layered, making them sound like ""a harem of Beyoncé's warbling for the affections of some sultan of swing."" According to James Poletti of Yahoo! Music, the female protagonist in the song sings about her ""potential to turn on the filth."" Lyrically, the song is a celebration of sexual lust and conquest, culminating in a desire for a one-night stand. This ""lustful sexual confidence"" is further demonstrated in the lyrics of the first verse: ""I'm feeling sexy / Wa[nt to] hear you say my name, boy/ If you can reach me, you can feel my burning flame / Feeling kind of N A S T Y / I might just take you home with me"" and the chorus lines: "" Tonight I'll be your naughty girl / I'm callin' all my girls / We're gonna turn this party out / I know you want my body."" Throughout the song, Beyoncé sings the lines ""I'd love to love you, baby"" almost whispering.

Critical reception
""Naughty Girl"" was critically lauded for its sensual vibe. Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine wrote that Beyoncé delivers a ""convincing impression of Donna Summer"". Los Angeles Times''' Natalie Nichols wrote that ""the deliberately Donna Summer-esque 'Naughty Girl' [...] successfully meld [Beyoncé] breathy cooing with hip, interesting production."" Lewis Dene of BBC commented that Beyoncé sings ""lustfully and sexually confident"", and Spence D. of IGN stated that she creates ""a brief aura of aural hypnotism"", an effect made during the line ""I'm feeling sexy"". He also added that the song was guaranteed to have even ""the most staid of folks slithering across the dance floor."" James Poletti of Yahoo! Music wrote that ""Naughty Girl"" mingles ""Holly Valance Moorish exoticism with a typically tight R&B groove.""

Rob Fitzpatrick of NME characterized Beyoncé's breathing heavily while grabbing the ""imaginary"" bedsheets but remained a ""devout young Christian woman singing what the public wants her to sing."" Describing ""Naughty Girl"" as an uptempo party track, Lisa Verrico of The Times commented that the song features ""an unusually high-pitched Beyoncé singing lines such as 'The rhythm's got me going crazy'"". Neil Drumming of Entertainment Weekly found Beyoncé's singing ""not quite convincingly a naughty girl"". This was echoed by Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times who said it was fun to hear Beyoncé mimicking ""the pizzicato line"" in ""Naughty Girl"", and that it was not much fun to hear her try to sing ""like a naughty girl"". Ed Masley of The Arizona Republic commented that ""Storch does his most convincing imitation of the Neptunes writing their own Kashmir in a Middle Eastern restaurant"".

Chart performance
""Naughty Girl"" did not achieve the chart success of ""Crazy in Love"" and ""Baby Boy"". However, like the latter and ""Me, Myself and I"", ""Naughty Girl"" attained more immediate and commercial success than its predecessors, propelling the album onto the charts and helping it be certified as multi-platinum. ""Naughty Girl"" debuted at number 68 on the US Billboard Hot 100 issue dated March 27, 2004. After eleven weeks on the chart, ""Naughty Girl"" received the digital gainer title and peaked at number three on the Billboard Hot 100 issue dated June 5, 2004.

Music video

The music video for ""Naughty Girl"" was directed by Jake Nava, who directed Beyoncé's videos, ""Crazy in Love"" and ""Baby Boy"". The video is inspired by the dancing of Cyd Charisse and Fred Astaire in the 1953 musical comedy film, The Band Wagon and has a Studio 54 style. Paired with Usher, Beyoncé dances seductively and flirts with him to portray a naughty girl. She felt that they were a ""perfect match"" for the dancing scenes in the video. According to Usher, the video is a homage to classic ""ultimate entertainers""; including dancers, singers and actors. He further talked about the collaboration on the video, saying, ""Beyoncé and me have been talking about doing a record together. She reached out to me and said she had an idea and really wanted me to be the lead in her video... I was like, 'Well let me hear the idea.' It sounded like something totally different than what had been on TV.""

The video begins with Beyoncé performing a simple dance routine surrounded by a wall of mirrors and then undressing until she is naked behind a white curtain, revealing only her silhouette. Beyoncé enters the club with a different outfit and hairstyle and some friends. Male patrons seated at the tables look on. She and Usher notice each other. They meet on the dance floor and dance intimately. Beyoncé performs an elaborate dance scene with female backing dancers. She swirls around in a champagne glass filled with bubbles. In the final scene, Beyoncé sits atop a piano and after being lifted down by a gentleman, she dances and poses as confetti falls everywhere.

Joseph Patel of MTV News described Beyoncé's and Usher's moves in the video as ""graceful"". Philadelphias Patrick DeMarco described the video as ""sexy"". A reviewer from Vibe compared Beyoncé's ""booty dance"" in the music video to those by Christina Aguilera in the music video for ""Dirrty"" (2002). On MTV's Total Request Live, ""Naughty Girl"" debuted at number ten on March 22, 2004, and peaked at number one.. It retired to TRL's ""Hall of Fame"" at number seven and after being on the countdown for fifty days. The video won Best Female Video at the 2004 MTV Video Music Awards and was nominated in the categories Best Choreography, Best Dance Video and Best Cinematography. At the 2005 MTV Australia Video Music Awards, the video received two nominations for Best R&B Video and Sexiest Video.

Live performances

During the Verizon Ladies First Tour which also featured Alicia Keys, Missy Elliott and Tamia, Beyoncé performed ""Naughty Girl"" as part of the concert's set list. Before starting to sing, she asked the audience: ""Do I have any naughty girls in the house tonight? Her DJ yelled: ""Do the A-Town stomp!"" Beyoncé then walked onto the stage with some female dancers. As she sang, more dancers appeared on smaller, circular platforms while fire shot from the floor and a long, rectangular screen merged video of flames with images of the performers. Beyoncé then performed portions of Vanity 6's song ""Nasty Girl"" (1982) as a small dance break. The song was included on the set list of Beyoncé's Dangerously in Love World Tour that began in late 2003. During the tour, she appeared suspended from the ceiling of the arena and was lowered into a red lounger.

The song was included on Beyoncé's set list on her concert tours The Beyoncé Experience (2007) and I Am... Tour (2009-2010). It was featured on the live albums The Beyoncé Experience Live (2007), and the deluxe edition of I Am... World Tour (2010) which contained performances from the tour. On August 5, 2007, Beyoncé performed the song at the Madison Square Garden in Manhattan. Before starting to sing, she asked loudly for ""all the naughty girls present"" at the concert to respond, which they did ""with enthusiasm"". While singing, Beyoncé was accompanied by her all-female band and she incorporated Donna Summer's ""Love to Love You Baby"" into ""Naughty Girl"". Jon Pareles of The New York Times complimented the performance, stating: ""Beyoncé needs no distractions from her singing, which can be airy or brassy, tearful or vicious, rapid-fire with staccato syllables or sustained in curlicued melismas. But she was in constant motion, strutting in costumes"". Shaheem Reid of MTV News also praised the performance, writing: ""For all the dancing she did, Beyoncé got an equally big — if not more resounding — response for displaying her undeniable vocal ability"". Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter wrote: ""The largely uptempo show featured some surprising arrangements that gave the material freshness, such [...] an injection of 'Love to Love You Baby' into 'Naughty Girl'.""

In Los Angeles, Beyoncé gave a full-length performance of the song, dressed in a green belly dancing costume. She performed with several female backup dancers and live instrumentation. When Beyoncé performed the song in Sunrise, Florida, on June 29, 2009, she was wearing a glittery gold leotard. As she sang, animated graphics of turntables, faders and other club equipment were projected behind the dancers and musicians. Beyoncé was accompanied by two drummers, two keyboardists, a percussionist, a horn section, three imposing backup vocalists called the Mamas and a lead guitarist, Bibi McGill. Beyoncé performed the song at the Wynn Theatre in Las Vegas, Nevada on August 2, 2009, as part of her show revue I Am... Yours. The performance was recorded and distributed in a DVD/CD package titled I Am... Yours: An Intimate Performance at Wynn Las Vegas.

Beyoncé performed ""Naughty Girl"" live at the 2011 Glastonbury Festival on June 26, 2011. In May 2012, Beyoncé performed ""Naughty Girl"" during her Revel Presents: Beyoncé Live revue at Revel Atlantic City. Before the performance of the song, one of the in-between films was shown, where of Beyoncé said, ""Harnessing the power of your body requires responsibility"". Then, she appeared dressed in a feathered headdress. During the performance of the song, Beyoncé performed it as a tribute to Donna Summer, singing her song ""Love to Love You Baby"". Maura Johnston of The Village Voice wrote that ""the sinuous 'Naughty Girl' had its source material laid bare at the outset when a sample of the groans and coos from 'Love To Love You Baby' was laid over it"". According to Spins Caryn Ganz, she was ""breaking out fluffy feathered fans"" during the performance of the song.

Cover versions and usage in media
""Naughty Girl"" has been covered by several artists. Irish singer-songwriter Roesy produced a version of the song which appeared on the 2004 charity album Even Better Than the Real Thing Vol. 2. Richard Cheese and Lounge Against the Machine covered the song on their 2006 album Silent Nightclub.

6087,"['( , ) ( Patestos II Pachomius ?']","Pachomius II Patestos (), (? – after 1585) was Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople from 1584 to 1585. He is sometimes considered an usurper.

Life
16th-century Greek sources show an extended bias against Pachomius: he is labeled as ""dissolute"" by Pseudo-Dorotheos and Leontios Eustrakios stated that he ""inflicted immeasurable grief upon the Christians"".

Pachomius was native of Lesbos.  He was a man of great education, a scholar, and he served as a teacher of philosophy and mathematics of Sultan Mehmed III. Around 1580 he became rector of the Patriarchal Church in Constantinople. On about 1583 or 1584, thanks to the support of his brother, who was a wealthy merchant, he bought his election to the Metropolitanate of Caesarea. However, Patriarch Jeremias II Tranos, who as Patriarch had the right to validate any Metropolitan's appointment, refused to confirm and consecrate him.

Pachomius led a group of Greek prelates who tried to overthrow Jeremias, accusing the latter of having supported a Greek uprising against the Ottoman Empire, to have baptized a Muslim and to be in correspondence with the Papacy.  Jeremias II was arrested and beaten, and three trials followed: the first charge was proven false, but the last resulted in his deposition on 22 February 1584. With a personal decision Sultan Mehmed III appointed Pachomius as Patriarch of Constantinople. The appointment was due not only to Pachomius's personal relationship with the Sultan, but also to a promise to increase the annual tax paid by the Church to the Ottoman state.

During Pachomius' patriarchate, a synod was held in Constantinople with the participation of Patriarch Sophronius IV of Jerusalem, which condemned the Gregorian calendar and exiled the former Patriarch Jeremias II, whom it charged not to have been opposed enough to the new calendar.

Same bishops tried to overthrow Pachomius, offering to Sultan Murad III the great amount of 40,000 florins. The Sultan however received the same amount from friends of Pachomius and kept him in place. Pachomius remained unpopular with most of his flock; when he was due to pay the increased annual gift he had promised to the Sultan, he tried to collect it from the Orthodox faithful, who refused their help. To obtain money Pachomius sold church properties, but he nevertheless failed to gather the promised amount. Pachomius also failed to address the ongoing polemic launched against him by the deacon of Jeremias II, Nikephoros, who considered his election as illegal. Finally Pachomius was deposed by a meeting of prelates on 26 or 27 February 1585, and the Sultan did not oppose to the synodal decision. Pachomius  was succeeded by Theoleptus II, who had leagued with him in overthrowing Jeremias the year before.

A year later Pachomius was acquitted of the charges and was sent to Egypt and Cyprus to collect donations. During his travel Pachomius was charged of immoral behavior, and he returned to Constantinople, where he worked and continued to pose problems. He was finally exiled in Wallachia, where he died.

6210,"['announced be to marriage our is when , longer no mother my deceive can I "" to ?']","Men was a 1918 American silent drama film directed by Perry N. Vekroff based upon a play by Harry Sophus Sheldon. It starred Anna Lehr, Charlotte Walker, and Robert Cain. It is considered to be a lost film.

Plot
As described in the Exhibitors Herald, a film magazine of the time, the plot was the following. Laura Burton (Lehr) refuses the love of an honest artist to accept the flattering attentions of Roger Hamilton (Cain), a society pet. In due time, however, she finds that she has been betrayed and returns to her mother (Walker). She reads of Hamilton's engagement to Alice Fairbanks (McCoy) who, in reality, is her sister adopted by the Fairbanks in childhood. Laura and her mother arrive in time to prevent the completion of the ceremony. Hamilton is denounced, Alice is free to marry the man she loves, and the young artist returns to claim Laura.

Reception
Like many American films of the time, Men was subject to restrictions and cuts by city and state film censorship boards. For example, the Chicago Board of Censors issued an Adults Only permit and cut, in Reel 6, the bridegroom shooting man. The board later rescinded the Adults Only permit after an agreement to make these additional changes, which modified the plot of the film: Reel 3, insert new intertitle ""We will steal quietly away and be married"", replace intertitle ""Soon when we are married"" with ""It will be necessary to keep our marriage secret until the objections of my family are overcome"", Reel 4, replace intertitle ""I can deceive my mother no longer — when are we to be married?"" to ""I can deceive my mother no longer, when is our marriage to be announced?"", replace intertitle ""My family still objects, I can never marry you"" to ""Our marriage is not legal"", Reel 5, during conversation between mother and daughter insert new intertitle ""My husband has deceived me with a mock marriage"" or words to that effect, and cut scene of bridegroom shooting man.

Racine was primarily a tragedian, producing such ""examples of neoclassical perfection"" as Phèdre, Andromaque, and Athalie. He did write one comedy, Les Plaideurs, and a muted tragedy,  Esther for the young.

Racine's plays displayed his mastery of the dodecasyllabic (12 syllable) French alexandrine. His writing is renowned for its elegance, purity, speed, and fury, and for what American poet Robert Lowell described as a ""diamond-edge"", and the ""glory of its hard, electric rage"". Racine's dramaturgy is marked by his psychological insight, the prevailing passion of his characters, and the nakedness of both plot and stage.

Biography
Racine was born on 22 December 1639 in La Ferté-Milon (Aisne), in the province of Picardy in northern France. Orphaned by the age of four (his mother died in 1641 and his father in 1643), he came into the care of his grandparents. At the death of his grandfather in 1649, his grandmother, Marie des Moulins, went to live in the convent of Port-Royal and took her grandson with her. He received a classical education at the Petites écoles de Port-Royal, a religious institution which would greatly influence other contemporary figures including Blaise Pascal. Port-Royal was run by followers of Jansenism, a theology condemned as heretical by the French bishops and the Pope. Racine's interactions with the Jansenists in his years at this academy would have great influence over him for the rest of his life. At Port-Royal, he excelled in his studies of the classics and the themes of Greek and Roman mythology would play large roles in his future works.

He was expected to study law at the Collège d'Harcourt in Paris, but instead found himself drawn to a more artistic lifestyle. Experimenting with poetry drew high praise from France's greatest literary critic, Nicolas Boileau, with whom Racine would later become great friends; Boileau would often claim that he was behind the budding poet's work. Racine eventually took up residence in Paris where he became involved in theatrical circles.

His first play, Amasie, never reached the stage. On 20 June 1664, Racine's tragedy La Thébaïde ou les frères ennemis (The Thebans or the enemy Brothers) was produced by Molière's troupe at the Théâtre du Palais-Royal, in Paris. The following year, Molière also put on Racine's second play, Alexandre le Grand. However, this play garnered such good feedback from the public that Racine secretly negotiated with a rival play company, the Hôtel de Bourgogne, to perform the play – since they had a better reputation for performing tragedies. Thus, Alexandre premiered for the second time, by a different acting troupe, eleven days after its first showing. Molière could never forgive Racine for this betrayal, and Racine simply widened the rift between him and his former friend by seducing Molière's leading actress, Thérèse du Parc, into becoming his companion both professionally and personally. From this point on the Hôtel de Bourgogne troupe performed all of Racine's secular plays.

Though both La Thébaïde (1664) and its successor, Alexandre (1665), had classical themes, Racine was already entering into controversy and forced to field accusations that he was polluting the minds of his audiences. He broke all ties with Port-Royal, and proceeded with Andromaque (1667), which told the story of Andromache, widow of Hector, and her fate following the Trojan War. Amongst his rivals were Pierre Corneille and his brother, Thomas Corneille. Tragedians often competed with alternative versions of the same plot: for example, Michel le Clerc produced an Iphigénie in the same year as Racine (1674), and Jacques Pradon also wrote a play about Phèdre (1677). The success of Pradon's work (the result of the activities of a claque) was one of the events which caused Racine to renounce his work as a dramatist at that time, even though his career up to this point was so successful that he was the first French author to live almost entirely on the money he earned from his writings. Others, including the historian Warren Lewis, attribute his retirement from the theater to qualms of conscience.

However, one major incident which seems to have contributed to Racine's departure from public life was his implication in a court scandal of 1679. He got married at about this time to the pious Catherine de Romanet, and his religious beliefs and devotion to the Jansenist sect were revived. He and his wife eventually had two sons and five daughters. Around the time of his marriage and departure from the theatre, Racine accepted a position as a royal historiographer in the court of King Louis XIV, alongside his friend Boileau. He kept this position in spite of the minor scandals he was involved in. In 1672, he was elected to the Académie française, eventually gaining much power over this organisation. Two years later, he was given the title of ""treasurer of France"", and he was later distinguished as an ""ordinary gentleman of the king"" (1690), and then as a secretary of the king (1696). Because of Racine's flourishing career in the court, Louis XIV provided for his widow and children after his death. When at last he returned to the theatre, it was at the request of Madame de Maintenon, morganatic second wife of King Louis XIV, with the moral fables, Esther (1689) and Athalie (1691), both of which were based on Old Testament stories and intended for performance by the pupils of the school of the Maison royale de Saint-Louis in Saint-Cyr (a commune neighboring Versailles, and now known as ""Saint-Cyr l'École"").

Jean Racine died in 1699 from cancer of the liver. He requested burial in Port-Royal, but after Louis XIV had this site razed in 1710, his remains were moved to the Saint-Étienne-du-Mont church in Paris.

Style

The quality of Racine's poetry is perhaps his greatest contribution to French literature. His use of the alexandrine poetic line is considered exceptionally skilful.

Racine's work faced many criticisms from his contemporaries. One was the lack of historic veracity in plays such as Britannicus (1669) and Mithridate (1673). Racine was quick to point out that his greatest critics – his rival dramatists – were among the biggest offenders in this respect. Another major criticism levelled at him was the lack of incident in his tragedy Bérénice (1670). Racine's response was that the greatest tragedy does not necessarily consist in bloodshed and death.

General characteristics
Racine restricts his vocabulary to 4000 words. He rules out all workaday expressions since, although the Greeks could call a spade a spade, he does not believe that this is possible in Latin or French. The classical unities are strictly observed, for only the final stage of a prolonged crisis is described. The number of characters, all of them royal, is kept down to the barest minimum. Action on stage is all but eliminated. The mangled Hippolyte is not brought back, as is the Hippolytus of Euripides. The one exception to this is that Atalide stabs herself before the audience in Bajazet; but this is acceptable in a play conspicuous for its savagery and Oriental colour.

Fundamental nature of tragedy
Tragedy shows how men fall from prosperity to disaster. The higher the position from which the hero falls, the greater is the tragedy. Except for the confidants, of whom Narcisse (in Britannicus) and Œnone (in Phèdre) are the most significant, Racine describes the fate of kings, queens, princes and princesses, liberated from the constricting pressures of everyday life and able to speak and act without inhibition.

Nature of Greek tragedy
Greek tragedy, from which Racine borrowed so plentifully, tended to assume that humanity was under the control of gods indifferent to its sufferings and aspirations. In the Œdipus Tyrannus Sophocles's hero becomes gradually aware of the terrible fact that, however hard his family has tried to avert the oracular prophecy, he has nevertheless killed his father and married his mother and must now pay the penalty for these unwitting crimes. The same awareness of a cruel fate that leads innocent men and women into sin and demands retribution of the equally innocent children, pervades La Thébaïde, a play that itself deals with the legend of Œdipus.

Racine’s tragic vision
Racine is often said to have been deeply influenced by the Jansenist sense of fatalism. However, the link between Racine's tragedy and Jansenism has been disputed on multiple grounds; for example, Racine himself denied any connection to Jansenism. As a Christian, Racine could no longer assume, as did Æschylus and Sophocles, that God is merciless in leading men to a doom which they do not foresee. Instead, destiny becomes (at least, in the secular plays) the uncontrollable frenzy of unrequited love.

As already in the works of Euripides, the gods have become more symbolic. Venus represents the unquenchable force of sexual passion within the human being in Euripides' Hippolytus; but closely allied to this – indeed, indistinguishable from it – is the atavistic strain of monstrous aberration that had caused her mother Pasiphaë to mate with a bull and give birth to the Minotaur.

Thus, in Racine the hamartia, which the thirteenth chapter of Aristotle’s Poetics had declared a characteristic of tragedy, is not merely an action performed in all good faith which subsequently has the direst consequences (Œdipus's killing a stranger on the road to Thebes, and marrying the widowed Queen of Thebes after solving the Sphinx's riddle), nor is it simply an error of judgment (as when Deianira, in the Hercules Furens of Seneca the Younger, kills her husband when intending to win back his love); it is a flaw of character.

Racine’s concept of love
In a second important respect, Racine is at variance with the Greek pattern of tragedy. His tragic characters are aware of, but can do nothing to overcome, the blemish which leads them on to a catastrophe. And the tragic recognition, or anagnorisis, of wrongdoing is not confined, as in the Œdipus Tyrannus, to the end of the play, when the fulfilment of the prophecy is borne in upon Œdipus; Phèdre realizes from the very beginning the monstrousness of her passion, and preserves throughout the play a lucidity of mind that enables her to analyse and reflect upon this fatal and hereditary weakness. Hermione's situation is rather closer to that of Greek tragedy. Her love for Pyrrhus is perfectly natural and is not in itself a flaw of character. But despite her extraordinary lucidity (II 1; V 1) in analysing her violently fluctuating states of mind, she is blind to the fact that the King does not really love her (III 3), and this weakness on her part, which leads directly to the tragic peripeteia of III 7, is the hamartia from which the tragic outcome arises.

For Racine, love closely resembles a physiological disorder. It is a fatal illness with alternating moods of calm and crisis, and with deceptive hopes of recovery or fulfilment (Andromaque, ll. 1441–1448; Phèdre, ll. 767-768), the final remission culminating in a quick death. His main characters are monsters, and stand out in glaring contrast to the regularity of the plays' structure and versification. The suffering lover Hermione, Roxane or Phèdre is aware of nothing except her suffering and the means whereby it can be relieved. Her love is not founded upon esteem of the beloved and a concern for his happiness and welfare, but is essentially selfish. In a torment of jealousy, she tries to relieve the ""pangs of despised love"" by having (or, in Phèdre's case, allowing) him to be put to death, and thus associating him with her own suffering. The depth of tragedy is reached when Hermione realizes that Pyrrhus's love for Andromaque continues beyond the grave, or when Phèdre contrasts the young lovers' purity with her unnaturalness which should be hidden from the light of day. Racine's most distinctive contribution to literature is his conception of the ambivalence of love: ""ne puis-je savoir si j'aime, ou si je hais?""

The passion of these lovers is totally destructive of their dignity as human beings, and usually kills them or deprives them of their reason. Except for Titus and Bérénice, they are blinded by it to all sense of duty. Pyrrhus casts off his fiancée in order to marry a slave from an enemy country, for whom he is prepared to repudiate his alliances with the Greeks. Orestes' duties as an ambassador are subordinate to his aspirations as a lover, and he finally murders the king to whom he has been sent. Néron's passion for Junie causes him to poison Britannicus and thus, after two years of virtuous government, to inaugurate a tyranny.

The characteristic Racinian framework is that of the eternal triangle: two young lovers, a prince and a princess, being thwarted in their love by a third person, usually a queen whose love for the young prince is unreciprocated. Phèdre destroys the possibility of a marriage between Hippolyte and Aricie. Bajazet and Atalide are prevented from marrying by the jealousy of Roxane. Néron divides Britannicus from Junie. In Bérénice the amorous couple are kept apart by considerations of state. In Andromaque the system of unrequited passions borrowed from tragicomedy alters the dramatic scheme, and Hermione destroys a man who has been her fiancé, but who has remained indifferent to her, and is now marrying a woman who does not love him. The young princes and princesses are agreeable, display varying degrees of innocence and optimism and are the victims of evil machinations and the love/hatred characteristic of Racine.

The major roles in Racinian tragedy
The king (Pyrrhus, Néron, Titus, Mithridate, Agamemnon, Thésée) holds the power of life and death over the other characters. Pyrrhus forces Andromaque to choose between marrying him and seeing her son killed. After keeping his fiancée waiting in Epirus for a year, he announces his intention of marrying her, only to change his mind almost immediately afterwards. Mithridate discovers Pharnace's love for Monime by spreading a false rumour of his own death. By pretending to renounce his fiancée, he finds that she had formerly loved his other son Xipharès. Wrongly informed that Xipharès has been killed fighting Pharnace and the Romans, he orders Monime to take poison. Dying, he unites the two lovers. Thésée is a rather nebulous character, primarily important in his influence upon the mechanism of the plot. Phèdre declares her love to Hippolyte on hearing the false news of his death. His unexpected return throws her into confusion and lends substance to Œnone's allegations. In his all-too-human blindness, he condemns to death his own son on a charge of which he is innocent. Only Amurat does not actually appear on stage, and yet his presence is constantly felt. His intervention by means of the letter condemning Bajazet to death (IV 3) precipitates the catastrophe.

The queen shows greater variations from play to play than anyone else, and is always the most carefully delineated character. Hermione (for she, rather than the pathetic and emotionally stable Andromaque, has a rôle equivalent to that generally played by the queen) is young, with all the freshness of a first and only love; she is ruthless in using Oreste as her instrument of vengeance; and she is so cruel in her brief moment of triumph that she refuses to intercede for Astyanax's life. Agrippine, an ageing and forlorn woman, ""fille, femme, sœur et mère de vos maîtres"", who has stopped at nothing in order to put her own son on the throne, vainly tries to reassert her influence over Néron by espousing the cause of a prince whom she had excluded from the succession. Roxane, the fiercest and bravest in Racine's gallery of queens, has no compunction in ordering Bajazet's death and indeed banishes him from her presence even before he has finished justifying himself. Clytemnestre is gentle and kind, but quite ineffectual in rescuing her daughter Iphigénie from the threat of sacrifice. Phèdre, passive and irresolute, allows herself to be led by Œnone; deeply conscious of the impurity of her love, she sees it as an atavistic trait and a punishment of the gods; and she is so consumed by jealousy that she can do nothing to save her beloved from the curse.

The confidants' primary function is to make monologues unnecessary. Only very rarely do they further the action. They invariably reflect the character of their masters and mistresses. Thus, Narcisse and Burrhus symbolize the warring elements of evil and good within the youthful Néron. But Narcisse is more than a reflection: he betrays and finally poisons his master Britannicus. Burrhus, on the other hand, is the conventional ""good angel"" of the medieval morality play. He is a much less colourful character than his opposite number. Œnone, Phèdre's evil genius, persuades her mistress to tell Hippolyte of her incestuous passion, and incriminates the young prince on Thésée's unexpected return. Céphise, knowing how deeply attached Pyrrhus is to her mistress, urges the despairing Andromaque to make a last appeal to him on her son's behalf, and so changes the course of the play.

Observance of the dramatic unities
Racine observes the dramatic unities more closely than the Greek tragedians had done. The philosopher Aristotle points out the ways in which tragedy differs from epic poetry:

""Tragedy generally tries to limit its action to a period of twenty-four hours, or not much exceeding that, whilst epic poetry is unlimited in point of time.""

Writing centuries after the great Attic tragedians and using their works as a basis for generalization, he does not insist that the action of a tragedy must be confined to a single revolution of the sun, or that it must take place in one locality. He merely says that this limitation was often practised by writers of tragedy, but he well knew that there were many plays in which no such limitation existed. For instance, Æschylus's Agamemnon compresses into about fifteen minutes a journey (from Troy to Argos) which must have taken several days.

Nor was the unity of place a general feature of Attic tragedy. Æschylus's The Eumenides has two settings and in The Suppliants of Euripides, it is sometimes impossible to tell where the action is taking place at all. But the circumstances of the Greek theatre, which had no curtain and no distinctive scenery and in which the chorus almost always remained on stage throughout the play, were such that it was frequently desirable to confine the action to a single day and a single place.

The only rule which Aristotle lays down concerning the dramatic action is that, in common with all other forms of art, a tragedy must have an internal unity, so that every part of it is in an organic relationship to the whole and no part can be changed or left out without detracting from the economy of the play. No dramatic critic has ever dissented from this unity of action; but the unities of time and place were in fact read into the Poetics by theoreticians of the New Learning (Jean de La Taille) and other writers (Jean Vauquelin de la Fresnaye and Jean Mairet). The support which the unities received from Cardinal Richelieu eventually secured their complete triumph and Pierre Corneille, who had not conformed to them in his earlier plays, did so from the time of Le Cid (1636) onwards. But even he found them a tiresome imposition. Only by a very ready suspension of disbelief can we accept that in the space of twenty-four hours El Cid kills Chimène's father in a duel, overwhelms the Moorish invaders during the night and fights a second duel only a few hours after the enemy has fled. These discrepancies – and others besides, which Corneille admits to in his Examen of the play – are obvious even to the most inattentive spectator.

Unlike his rival, who crams into his plays ""quantité d'incidents qui ne se pourraient passer qu'en un mois"", Racine describes fluctuating states of mind which, in the rapidly mounting tension, are brought abruptly to a crisis from which there is no retreat. The so-called Aristotelian rules happen to suit this type of drama perfectly since they lead the playwright to concentrate the tragic action on those few hours when, after months or years of emotional tension, a new event supervenes and precipitates the catastrophe.

The most striking evidence of Racine's success in fitting his tragedies into this very stringent framework is that, when watching them, the audience ceases to be aware that the unities exist. Not long before he wrote Phèdre, the same subject had been dealt with by Gabriel Gilbert and Mathieu Bidar, both of whom had kept Hippolyte off stage after Act IV. Racine, on the other hand, brings him into Act V scene 1, the last line of which is only seventy or eighty lines earlier than Théramène's récit in V 6. In the four minutes which these lines take to recite the young prince has gone out with Théramène, has met, fought and been killed by the monster, and Théramène has come back to announce his master's death. Furthermore, Aricie only leaves the stage at the end of V 3, and therefore in the space of two short scenes has met her dying lover on the seashore and has taken her leave of him! These chronological inconsistencies pass unnoticed in the theatre.

Racine invariably observes the unity of place. A room in Pyrrhus's palace at Buthrotum; an antechamber separating the apartments of Titus and Bérénice in Rome; Agamemnon's camp at Aulis; an antechamber in the temple at Jerusalem: by choosing such vague and remote settings Racine gives his plays a universal character, and the presentation of conflicting and hesitating states of mind is not hampered by an undue insistence on material surroundings. At times, of course, the unity of place leads to slightly far-fetched meetings: why, for instance, does Pyrrhus come to see Oreste (Act I Sc. 2), rather than the other way around, except to conform to this rule? Lastly, the unity of place necessitates the récit and this again is in complete harmony with Racine's fundamental aims: how would Andromaque gain by our being able to see Pyrrhus and his bride approach and enter the temple? The important fact is the effect of Cléone's words upon Hermione. Oreste's relating to Hermione the murder of Pyrrhus is the supreme irony of the play. Théramène's récit describes, in the most memorable and poetic language, an event which would be infinitely less moving if it were to be seen it imperfectly represented upon the stage.

As regards the unity of action, Racine differs sharply from William Shakespeare in excluding minor plots (compare the parallel themes of blind and unnatural fatherhood and the retribution it invokes, in King Lear) and in ruling out the comic element. The fact that Act II scene 5 of Andromaque or many of the scenes of Alexandre le Grand and Mithridate have comic undertones is beside the point. Will Andromaque agree to marry Pyrrhus? Will Agamemnon sacrifice Iphigénie? Can Esther persuade her husband to spare the Jews? The plots of Bajazet, Phèdre and Athalie are scarcely more complex than the rest.

Tempo of Racinian tragedy
Unlike such plays as Hamlet and The Tempest, in which a dramatic first scene precedes the exposition, a Racinian tragedy opens very quietly, but even so in a mood of suspense. In Andromaque Pyrrhus's unenviable wavering between Hermione and the eponymous heroine has been going on for a year and has exasperated all three. Up to the time when Britannicus begins, Néron has been a good ruler, a faithful disciple of Seneca and Burrhus, and a dutiful son; but he is now beginning to show a spirit of independence. With the introduction of a new element (Oreste's demand that Astyanax should be handed over to the Greeks; Junie's abduction; Abner's unconscious disclosure that the time to proclaim Joas has finally come), an already tense situation becomes, or has become, critical. In a darkening atmosphere, a succession of fluctuating states of mind on the part of the main characters brings us to the resolution – generally in the fourth Act, but not always (Bajazet, Athalie) – of what by now is an unbearable discordance. Hermione entrusts the killing of Pyrrhus to Oreste; wavers for a moment when the King comes into her presence; then, condemns him with her own mouth. No sooner has Burrhus regained his old ascendancy over Néron, and reconciled him with his half-brother, than Narcisse most skilfully overcomes the emperor's scruples of conscience and sets him on a career of vice of which Britannicus's murder is merely the prelude. By the beginning of Act IV of Phèdre, Œnone has besmirched Hippolyte's character, and the Queen does nothing during that Act to exculpate him. With the working-out of a situation usually decided by the end of Act IV, the tragedies move to a swift conclusion.

Treatment of sources
In the religious plays, Racine is fairly scrupulous in adhering to his Old Testament sources, taking care to put into the mouth of Joad (the Second Jehoiada) only those prophetic utterances that are to be found in the Bible. Nevertheless, he takes advantage of a verse in II Chronicles XXIV attributing the gift of prophecy to Joad's son Zacharie (Zechariah ben Jehoiada) in order to suppose that the father (whom the Bible does not describe as a prophet) likewise had prophetic powers. And thinking a child of seven – the age of Joas (Jehoash of Judah) in the Second Book of Kings – too young to have the part given him in Athalie, Racine makes him into a boy of nine or ten on the evidence of the Septuagint version of II Chronicles XXIII 1.

In the secular plays, he takes far greater liberties. The frequently conflicting sources of Greek and Roman mythology enable him to fashion the plot he thinks suitable to his characters and, above all, to present the old stories in a modern light. Whereas Euripides, in his Iphigenia in Aulis, averts the heroine's death only by causing Artemis to spirit her away to Tauris, putting a heart in her place on the sacrificial altar. Racine, determined to avoid the miraculous, borrows from a minor Greek writer, the geographer Pausanias, the character of Ériphile. The disclosure that Iphigénie's treacherous rival was herself called Iphigeneia at birth and should be sacrificed in the heroine's place prevents a tragic outcome.

In creating Andromaque, Racine believes he must ""[se] conformer à l'idée que nous avons maintenant de cette princesse"". Astyanax, whom Euripides describes (in The Trojan Women and the Andromache) as having been thrown from the walls of Troy and killed, and whose death is foreshadowed in book 24 of the Iliad, is made to survive the capture of Troy and the extinction of his dynasty. In another respect also, Racine departs from the lines laid down by the Andromache, for whereas in the earlier play the heroine fears that the son she has had by Pyrrhus may suffer death if she refuses to marry the father, the later heroine fears for the life of a legitimate son. The reason for these changes in the Homeric and Euripidean traditions is obvious: if Andromaque had been Pyrrhus's mistress (as in Euripides), why should she refuse to marry him? Racine, like Homer, conceives her as sublimely faithful to Hector; yet the tension (III 8) between maternal love and a reluctance to marry Pyrrhus must (as in Euripides) be paramount. And so Astyanax is brought back to life.

Phèdre differs from Euripides's Hippolytus and Seneca the Younger's Phædra in the very important respect that, taking the character of Aricie from Virgil, Racine introduces the jealousy motive. Despite the fact that Hippolyte, ""ce fils chaste et respectueux"", is indifferent to her, Phèdre will not consent to Œnone's suggesting to Thésée that the son has made improper advances to the stepmother – until (IV 5) she discovers that he has loved Aricie all along.

Criticism
Racine's works have evoked in audiences and critics a wide range of responses, ranging from reverence to revulsion. In his book Racine: A Study (1974), Philip Butler of the University of Wisconsin broke the main criticisms of Racine down by century to show the almost constantly shifting perception of the playwright and his works.

17th century
In his own time, Racine found himself compared constantly with his contemporaries, especially the great Pierre Corneille. In his own plays, Racine sought to abandon the ornate and almost otherworldly intricacy that Corneille so favored. Audiences and critics were divided over the worth of Racine as an up-and-coming playwright. Audiences admired his return to simplicity and their ability to relate to his more human characters, while critics insisted on judging him according to the traditional standards of Aristotle and his Italian commentators from which he tended to stray. Attitudes shifted, however, as Racine began to eclipse Corneille. In 1674, the highly respected poet and critic Boileau published his Art Poétique which deemed Racine's model of tragedy superior to that of Corneille. This erased all doubts as to Racine's abilities as a dramatist and established him as one of the period's great literary minds.

Butler describes this period as Racine's ""apotheosis,"" his highest point of admiration. Racine's ascent to literary fame coincided with other prodigious cultural and political events in French history. This period saw the rise of literary giants like Molière, Jean de La Fontaine, Boileau, and François de La Rochefoucauld, as well as Louis Le Vau's historic expansion of the Palace of Versailles, Jean-Baptiste Lully's revolution in Baroque music, and most importantly, the ascension of Louis XIV to the throne of France.

During Louis XIV's reign, France rose up from a long period of civil discord (see the Fronde) to new heights of international prominence. Political achievement coincided with cultural and gave birth to an evolution of France's national identity, known as l'esprit français. This new self-perception acknowledged the superiority of all things French; the French believed France was home to the greatest king, the greatest armies, the greatest people, and, subsequently, the greatest culture. In this new national mindset, Racine and his work were practically deified, established as the perfect model of dramatic tragedy by which all other plays would be judged. Butler blames the consequential ""withering"" of French drama on Racine's idolized image, saying that such rigid adherence to one model eventually made all new French drama a stale imitation.

19th century
The French installation of Racine into the dramatic and literary pantheon evoked harsh criticism from many sources who argued against his 'perfection.' Germans like Friedrich Schiller and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe dismissed Racine as höfisches Drama, or ""courtly drama"" too restricted by the étiquette and conventions of a royal court for the true expression of human passion. French critics, too, revolted. Racine came to be dismissed as merely ""an historical document"" that painted a picture only of 17th century French society and nothing else; there could be nothing new to say about him. However, as writers like Charles Baudelaire and Gustave Flaubert came onto the scene to soundly shake the foundations of French literature, conservative readers retreated to Racine for the nostalgia of his simplicity.

As Racine returned to prominence at home, his critics abroad remained hostile due mainly, Butler argues, to Francophobia. The British were especially damning, preferring Shakespeare and Sir Walter Scott to Racine, whom they dismissed as ""didactic"" and ""commonplace."" This did not trouble the French, however, as ""Racine, La Fontaine, or generally speaking the chefs-d'œuvre de l'esprit humain could not be understood by foreigners.""

20th century
The 20th century saw a renewed effort to rescue Racine and his works from the chiefly historical perspective to which he had been consigned. Critics called attention to the fact that plays such as Phèdre could be interpreted as realist drama, containing characters that were universal and that could appear in any time period. Other critics cast new light upon the underlying themes of violence and scandal that seem to pervade the plays, creating a new angle from which they could be examined. In general, people agreed that Racine would only be fully understood when removed from the context of the 18th century. Marcel Proust developed a fondness for Racine at an early age, ""whom he considered a brother and someone very much like himself..."" – Marcel Proust: A Life, by Jean-Yves Tadié, 1996.

In his essay, The Theatre and Cruelty, Antonin Artaud claimed that 'the misdeeds of the psychological theater descended from Racine have made us unaccustomed to that immediate and violent action which the theater should possess' (p. 84).

21st century

At present, Racine is still widely considered a literary genius of revolutionary proportions. His work is still widely read and frequently performed. Racine's influence can be seen in A.S. Byatt's tetralogy (The Virgin in the Garden 1978, Still Life 1985, Babel Tower 1997 and A Whistling Woman 2002). Byatt tells the story of Frederica Potter, an English young woman in the early 1950s (when she is first introduced), who is very appreciative of Racine, and specifically of Phedre.

Translations

The linguistic effects of Racine's poetry are widely considered to be untranslatable, although many eminent poets have attempted to translate Racine's work into English, including Lowell, Richard Wilbur, Ted Hughes, Tony Harrison, and Derek Mahon, and Friedrich Schiller into German.

Racine's plays have been translated into English by Robert David MacDonald, Alan Hollinghurst (Berenice, Bajazet), by RADA director Edward Kemp (Andromache), Neil Bartlett, and poet Geoffrey Alan Argent, who earned a 2011 American Book Award for the translating The Complete Plays of Jean Racine.

In 2003, Razon moved to ABS-CBN's rival network GMA-7, where he became one of the hosts of Unang Hirit and anchor of Unang Balita, the show's news segment. He left GMA in 2005.

On June 16, 2005, it was reported by the Manila Bulletin that Razon was forced to resign from GMA for the network ""to maintain its neutrality in the midst of the ongoing bitter conflict between the Iglesia ni Cristo (Church of Christ; INC) and the Members Church of God International (MCGI). At that time, Razon was the Vice Presiding Minister of MCGI, and the network had been receiving text messages from both INC and MCGI members, each accusing the other of wrongdoing. GMA ""felt being placed in the middle of such conflict will not serve its best interest and decided to let go of Razon."" The source of INC's complaint stemmed from Razon's pronouncement in MCGI's doctrinal activity in which he said ""You can see demons in Net 25 (a network owned by the INC's affiliate Eagle Broadcasting Corporation)."" Razon was quoted in the MCGI website as saying ""I'd rather lose everything than to lose God"" in reaction to the conflict he was facing regarding his job in Unang Hirit and in Ang Dating Daan (The Old Path).

In July 2005, Razon transferred its present home to UNTV, a UHF television network owned by the Progressive Broadcasting Corporation majority owned by Alfredo ""Atom"" Henares for the launching of his own morning program on UNTV, Pilipinas, Gising Ka Na Ba?!, later on July 23, 2007, the program was changed to Good Morning Kuya (lit. Good Morning Brother).

Charities
Daniel, through his morning talk show Good Morning Kuya and public service program Serbisyong Bayanihan, started many public service projects such as free medical/dental check-ups and medicines for the indigent. Razon's regular free medical missions are achieved through his Mobile Clinic Bus, which can reach even far-flung towns in the Philippines.

On January 15, 2008, Razon's morning TV show Good Morning Kuya was cited by then-DOTC Secretary Leandro Mendoza for establishing a public service program Alay Kay Nanay at Tatay Project for senior citizens riding the MRT3. Over 5,000 senior citizens were served by the program and provided free travel aboard the MRT3.

In February 2009, Razon and Soriano together with the Kamanggagawa Foundation Inc., launched the Isang Araw Lang (Just One Day) advocacy. The advocacy aims to educate people to and help the needy for just one day. The campaign aims to inspire talented people to commit their talents, skills and resources for the less fortunate, also for just one day.

He led the construction and currently serves as the president of a free school for tertiary students located in Apalit, Pampanga and Caloocan. With this program, Daniel Razon makes sure that every scholars of this program will enjoy zero tuition fees and many other benefits including free food, lodging & transportation.

In 2011, the Polytechnic University of the Philippines awarded Razon the title of ""Doctor of Humanities – Honoris Causa"" for his public services and charitable works.

Razon conceptualized the original charity basketball league in the Philippines, the UNTV Cup, which started in 2013. Its goal is to promote camaraderie between government agencies through the most unifying sport in the Philippines, while delivering public service towards marginalized sectors of our society. The regular season runs from August/September up to March of the following year. The awarding of prizes to the agencies' chosen beneficiaries coincide with the UNTV Cup championship games. From Season 1 to Season 6, including the three off season tournaments, UNTV Cup has given a total of ₱35 million to the beneficiaries of the participating teams.

Controversies
Razon was declared a persona non grata by the Municipal Government of Apalit, Pampanga, the same town where the Philippine headquarters of Members Church of God International is located for stating unsavory remarks against the Mayor of Apalit, who once aggrieved Soriano. The Municipal Council approved the declaration through Resolution 28, series of 2008. The resolution further stated that ""Razon's pronouncement in the Good Morning Kuya TV-charity program has misinformed and misled the public and is meant to malign the wisdom of its officials and put them in a bad light.""

Career as a Musician
Razón is also a singer and songwriter. Some of his compositions are Unang Pag-ibig (First Love), Dala Kong Nakalimbag and Pangarap ng Puso (My Heart's Wish). His maiden album ""In My Eyes"" reached platinum record status. His latest album ""All My Life"" was released in September 2008, which was awarded a gold record on the day of its release and earned him the People's Choice Favorite New Male Artist award in the 21st Awit Awards on November 26, 2008.

6259,"['disagree we do where , Sir , Now ?']","A clinical officer (CO) is a gazetted officer who is qualified and licensed to practice medicine.

In her books, ""Beyond the State: The Colonial Medical Service in British Africa"" and ""Indian Doctors in Kenya, 1895 - 1940: The Forgotten History"", the author Anna Greenwood notes that before 1923 there were twice as many Indian doctors as there were European doctors working in the Colonial Medical Service. The Indian doctors had migrated to British Africa along with the coolies who came to work on the Uganda Railway. The Indian doctors faced discrimination and were not appointed to nor paid at the same rank as medical officers (European doctors). Instead, they were designated as Assistant or Sub-assistant surgeons despite having attended similar 3 - 4 year Indian medical schools that were recognized by the General Medical Council in the UK and performing clinical and administrative duties that were largely identical to those of the European doctors. From the mid-1920s the Indians were removed from the colonial service as they were not deemed to be the proper face of the imperial services in Africa. The Indian Assistant and Sub-Assistant Surgeons were thus replaced with similarly qualified Africans who came to be known as clinical officers when the authorizing legislation was passed in 1988 abolishing the Assistant and Sub-Assistant Surgeon and similar positions.

In Kenya, the origin of the clinical officer can be traced back to around 1888 when Sir William Mackinnon, 1st Baronet founded the Imperial British East Africa Company. The company was granted royal charter by Queen Victoria and was used by the Government of the United Kingdom to establish its influence in the East Africa Protectorate (present day Kenya). As the influence grew a healthcare system developed to meet the medical needs of the colony. In 1901 Kenyatta National Hospital was established as the Native Civil Hospital and later renamed the King George VI Hospital after King George VI of the United Kingdom. In 1958 the European Hospital (present-day Nairobi Hospital) was established in the same area to serve the European settlers. The need for qualified medical staff who would provide preventive, promotive, curative and rehabilitative services in hospitals and communities led to the establishment of the first formal training programme for clinical officers at Kenyatta National Hospital in 1928. The programme initially admitted experienced nurses and took them through a one-year certificate course which prepared them for advanced practice. The nursing pathway was discontinued and new students had to study clinical medicine and surgery and sit and pass continuous assessment tests and final qualifying examinations for three years which covered basic medical sciences, medicine, surgery, paediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology, community health, rural health and health service management before admission into a compulsory one-year hospital internship programme and completion of a further three-year period of clinical supervision..

The training expanded after Kenya's independence in 1962 through to 1970 when the newly created University of Nairobi started its own medical school and also used Kenyatta National Hospital as its teaching hospital. Legislation to regulate medical practice by clinical officers was passed in 1988 thus creating the Clinical Officers Council in 1989. In 1990 the Kenya Medical Training College was established by the government with campuses in all major towns and in 1996 the Roman Catholic Diocese of Kakamega established St. Mary's School of Clinical Medicine at St. Mary's Hospital in Mumias which become the second and third institutions to offer the training in Kenya. By this time clinical officers had to complete an accredited four-year programme of study, practicals and internship in clinical medicine and surgery and have their names entered in the clinical officers register which was cleaned annually and taken to the government printer to be published in the Kenya Gazette. Private practice by clinical officers who had left government service after working for a minimum of 10 years was now allowed.

Professional degrees in clinical medicine and surgery were first offered by Egerton University and other universities as from 2006 and in 2012 the Commission for University Education Act No. 42 of 2012 removed the accreditation role from all regulatory bodies such as the Clinical Officers Council (COC) and the Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentists Council (KMPDC) making the Commission for University Education (CUE) the only authorized accrediting body for all university degrees in Kenya including the degree in clinical medicine. In 2017 the old legislation was repealed and the Clinical Officers Council reconstituted by the Clinical Officers (Training, Registration and Licensing) Act No. 20 of 2017 which requires each clinical officer, clinic or medical centre to be registered by the council and to maintain a current practice license and a current practising certificate in order to operate legally within the scope of medicine, dentistry, orthopedics or health work. A clinical officer may, with respect to patients - examine, diagnose, order laboratory and imaging investigations, prescribe treatment and perform procedures as per their scope of training. Clinical officers are members of the Kenya Clinical Officers Association and the Kenya Union of Clinical Officers. In June 2020 the Public Service Commission approved the Revised Scheme of Service for Clinical Personnel which was issued by the State Department for Public Service to define the clinical officer's career structure, job description, standards for recruitment, training and advancement, and career planning and succession management within the civil service. The scheme is administered by the Ministry of Health through the Cabinet Secretary and the Principal Secretary in conjunction with the Public Service Commission and the County Chief Officer for Health in each of the 47 Counties of Kenya.

Clinical officer is a professional designation established by the government through the Clinical Officers Council (COC) which has jurisdiction and responsibility for the clinical officer's training, registration and licensing and each officer must (1) study clinical medicine and surgery or clinical medicine and community health for three or four years (2) graduate from a government-accredited medical training college (3) sit and pass a government licensing examination (4) complete an internship year at a teaching hospital (5) be registered as a clinical officer (6) have a medical practice licence (7) complete a three-year period of clinical supervision under a senior clinical officer or a senior medical officer (8) have a practising certificate if they have a private practice which allows one to provide general medical services on their own directly to the public (9) undergo one or two additional years of specialized training (optional) and (10) become a trainer. Clinical Officer (CO) is a protected professional title and its use by unregistered persons is prohibited by law and punishable by up to five years in jail with or without a fine. Globally, the title may not have legal restrictions and can refer to a job grade rather than a medical qualification such as junior assistive clinical staff (e.g. in Zambia and Tanzania), licensed medical professionals (e.g. in Kenya and Malawi) or high-level corporate officers, directors, and managers (e.g. Chief Clinical Officers in Europe and the United States).

A clinical officer observes, interviews and examines sick and healthy individuals in all specialties to determine and document their health status and applies relevant pathological, radiological, psychiatric and community health techniques, procedures and findings needed to classify diseases and related health problems and to establish a provisional or final diagnosis upon which to prescribe, initiate, carry out or terminate treatment or therapy based on their specialized knowledge, skills and experience in clinical pharmacology, use of clinical guidelines, best practices and disease patterns as well as individual patient and community characteristics while being actively pharmacovigilant to prevent, identify, minimize and manage drug reactions, drug errors, side effects and poisoning, overdiagnosis, overscreening, overtreatment and futile care. A clinical officer performs general and specialized medical duties such as diagnosis and treatment of disease and injury, ordering and interpreting medical tests, performing routine medical and surgical procedures, referring patients to other practitioners and managing health departments, institutions, projects and systems.

Clinical officers, medical officers and medical practitioners are the only officers who are gazetted and licensed to practice medicine in Kenya. They work under oath and generate credible health data and information within communities and health institutions and cascade the same to the county and national governments, government agencies and third parties through standard recording and reporting tools from the Ministry of Health which are used to capture data on disease outbreaks, physical injuries and deformities, mental illness, drug resistance, disability, nutritional disorders, births and deaths among others.

Overview
To practice medicine and surgery or dentistry as a clinical officer one requires at least four years of full-time medical training, supervised clinical practice and internship at an accredited medical training institution and hospitals and registration with the relevant medical board in their country. After a prescribed number of years in active practice, one may complete a further one or two-year residency programme in order to specialize in any approved branch of clinical medicine and surgery such as anesthesia or pediatrics, or get an advanced medical qualification from the university. There are no pathways (post-basic or post-graduate entry-level conversion programs) for nurses and other health workers hence it takes at least eight years of specialised medical training and experience for a clinical officer to graduate with a post-basic qualification. ""Clinical officer"" in some countries such as Tanzania and Zambia refers to a different cadre of health workers, comparable to ""medical assistants"" in Malawi, who have less than three years of training but who may upgrade to a similar level by becoming Assistant Medical Officers (AMOs) or Medical Licentiates (MLs).""medical assistants/Sub Assistant Community Medical Officer"" in Bangladesh, a Four Year medical diploma course conducting state medical faculty of Bangladesh under ministry of Health and family welfare.

A clinician can specialize in any other field that is deemed appropriate by them and not just clinical medicine. China also has masters of clinical medicine. In countries like Tanzania, UK, and other countries, clinical medicine is regarded as a medical course and graduates are allowed to apply to masters of medicine specialties.

No significant difference has been demonstrated in studies comparing treatment decisions, patient outcomes, quality of care provided and level of knowledge about diseases between a clinical officer and a medical officer (a non-specialist physician) except in countries where nurses were mistakenly assessed as clinical officers. However, because of the nature of practice, populations served and resources at ones disposal, a clinical officer is less likely to administer expensive treatment, prescribe expensive (but not necessarily better) drugs or engage in futile care.

The success of HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment initiatives in Africa is mostly attributed to use of clinical officers to diagnose the disease and provide comprehensive medical care. Access to emergency obstetric care through greater deployment of the clinical officer is one way of attaining the Millennium Development Goals 4 (reducing child mortality) and 5 (improving maternal health).

Worldwide, patients are seen by many other practitioners other than the traditional doctor such as:
Osteopathic physicians, Podiatrists, Optometrists and Anesthesiologist assistants in the United States
Emergency and Clinical Officer Pakistan
Physician Assistants in the United States, United Kingdom, Netherlands, Liberia and Ghana
Assistant Doctors in China,
Surgical Care and Emergency Care Practitioners in the UK,
Assistant Physicians in Saudi Arabia,
Health Extension Officers in Papua New Guinea
medical assistants/Sub Assistant Community Medical Officer in Bangladesh
Medical Assistants in Fiji
Assistant Medical Officers in Malaysia
Surgical Technologists in Mozambique
Clinical Associates in South Africa.

Scope of practice
A clinical officer takes the Hippocratic oath and, depending on jurisdiction, may be registered by the same statutory board as physicians (in the southern countries such as Zambia and Malawi) or a separate board (in the eastern countries such as Kenya and Uganda). The broad nature of medical training prepares one to work at all levels of the health care system. Most work in primary care health centres and clinics, and casualty departments in hospitals where one will diagnose and treat all common diseases, including serious and life-threatening ones, in all age groups; and stabilise then admit, discharge or refer emergency cases. In smaller hospitals one may work as a hospitalist and one who has specialized in a clinical field provides advanced medical and surgical care and treatment such as administering anesthesia, performing general or specialised surgery, supervising other health workers and other administrative duties.

A clinical officer's scope of practice depends on one's training and experience, jurisdiction and workplace policies. In Malawi, for instance, a clinical officer performs all routine surgical and obstetric operations such as exploratory laparatomy, emergency orthopaedics and Caesarean section. However, in Kenya, Tanzania and Mozambique one has to undergo further specialized training in order to perform such major operations safely.

In rural and small urban health facilities a clinical officer is usually the highest medical care provider and works with minimal resources, relying on the traditional medical history and physical examination, often with little or no laboratory facilities, to make a diagnosis and provide treatment. In bigger and better equipped facilities a clinical officer generally acquires superior knowledge, experience and skills and provides high quality and a wider range of services in district, provincial and national hospitals, universities and colleges, research institutions and private medical facilities.

A clinical officer is usually the lowest entry-level cadre in the medical hierarchy but with years of experience and/or further training one can rise to the same or a higher grade than a physician. In most countries, however, wages are usually low compared to training and responsibilities and career progression is usually restricted by awarding terminal degrees and diplomas, training students who have not attained the minimum university entry grade and, in some countries, not awarding any degree or recognition for advanced training. In such countries, this usually results in a demotivated and low quality workforce and resulting poor health indicators.

The United States' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other international health and research institutions make extensive use of COs in their projects in Africa and clinical officers have been the backbone of HIV care and treatment enabling the rollout of ARVS to even the most rural hard to reach areas in Africa.

Research done by the University of Birmingham and published in the British Medical Journal concluded that the effectiveness and safety of caeserian sections carried out by clinical officers did not differ significantly compared with doctors. Better health outcomes including lower maternal mortality rates were observed where COs had completed further specialised training particularly in anaesthesia.

In the multi-country study, poor outcomes were observed in Burkina Faso and Zaire - the only countries where the procedure was performed by trained nurses. Higher rates of wound infection and Wound dehiscence in these countries was thought to be due to the nurses' poor surgical technique and need for enhanced training.

Kenya
Kenya has a comprehensive framework of parallel laws and regulations that govern the medical practice of medical officers and clinical officers. The supreme health policy and medical authorities in the republic are the cabinet secretary of health and the director of medical services who oversee the registration and licensing of medical institutions and the training, registration and licensing of medical practitioners through the Medical Practitioners and Dentists Board and the Clinical Officers Council.

As a British colony in 1928, Kenya started training a select group of natives to practice medicine and care for the local population who were increasingly accepting and seeking western medicine. After independence from Britain in 1963, medical training in Kenya initially adopted the four-year medical school system used in the US rather than the six-year UK model. This was heavily influenced by the Kennedy Airlift which followed initial funding by the African-American Students Foundation (AASF) in 1959 and led to hundreds of young Kenyan students getting scholarships to study in American institutions: These students came back to Kenya after their studies and joined the civil service in the early post-independence Kenya. It was also around this time that the first DOs were accepted as medical officers by the US civil service and by 1967 the structure and duration of medical training in Kenya was similar to the US MD training. When the University of Nairobi split from the University of East Africa and became the first university in Kenya in 1970, it continued to teach the six-year British degree which led to the creation of two statutory bodies: the Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentists Board in 1978 which had jurisdiction over medical officers and physicians, and the Clinical Officers Council in 1989 which had jurisdiction over clinical officers. Instead of residency for the clinical officer, the higher diploma in paediatrics, ophthalmology and other specializations was introduced in the late 1970s as a post-basic course for those who had worked for three or more years and, after ten years of service, one became a Senior Clinical Officer and qualified for a licence to practice under his own name as a private medical practitioner. The BSc. Clinical Medicine and Surgery degree was later introduced in 2006.

Clinical officers play a central role in Kenya's medical sector today. There were 8,600 clinical officers on the register in 2010 compared to 7,100 medical officers. They are trained by the universities, the Kenya Medical Training College (KMTC), St. Mary's School of Clinical Medicine and other private institutions. The Ministry of Health, through the Clinical Officers Council (COC) regulates their training and practice, accredits training institutions, and approves the syllabi of the universities and colleges. The Kenya Medical Training College (KMTC), also under the Ministry of Health, has campuses in regional teaching hospitals and trains the majority of clinical officers. St. Mary's School of Clinical Medicine and St. Mary's Mission Hospital in Mumias, owned by the Roman Catholic diocese of Kakamega, was the first private institution to train clinical officers. It admits students who got the minimum university entry grade in high school and have passed a written examination and oral interview. The students sit the same examination as their counterparts at the KMTC and are examined by consultants from the public service.

On 28 October 1981 lawmakers addressed the National Assembly as follows:
Mr. Orengo: On a point of order Mr. Deputy Speaker Sir. Is it really in order for the hon. Member for Butere to impute that this house does not know that clinical officers are not allowed to practice. I think the motion is just after legalizing the position and not saying that they are not allowed to practice.
Mr. Shikuku: Mr. Deputy Speaker, we heard Dr. Chibule saying that he is going to give us a list of 20 clinical officers who are being refused permission to practice and forced to go back to government practice and this is the thing I am trying to reply to. The hon. Member was in the house when Dr. Chibule said this but I do not know why he did not hear him say so, but nevertheless, let me continue. Mr. Deputy speaker, Sir, the clinical officers helped the government during the recent doctors' strike in the country when we virtually depended on them. Now, Sir, part (a) of this motion is not the responsibility of the Ministry of Health because if anybody wants to pursue higher education, even from this house, it is upon him first to make sure he has the prerequisite qualifications to pursue higher studies. So, with that, the ministry is not concerned. Part (b) of the motion is the most important. We are requiring the enactment of a law to cover our present clinical officers to allow them to practice and be covered by the law as the doctors are covered. This is the point and the assistant minister for health has produced a paper which is going to be presented before the cabinet after which it will come to the house. Now, Sir, where do we disagree? There is no place where we disagree. What we are trying to say is that the government is already doing what it is being asked to do, and that is why we are saying that this matter has more or less been overtaken by events. Therefore, we are not going to be asked to do what we are already doing.
Mr. Orengo: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir.
Mr. Shikuku: You can have as many points of order as you like!

The dual diploma in clinical medicine and surgery plus an internship year is the standard qualification for clinical officers which is awarded on completion of a four-year training programme which started as various programmes that were used to train medical practitioners in the East Africa Protectorate in the 1920s and which now resembles the North American four-year MD and DO medical school programmes (including being structured in 9 trimesters over 3 years to meet the minimum 130 weeks of instruction recommended by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education) instead of the more recent six-year MBChB programme that was introduced in the 1970s and is more common in European and Commonwealth countries:

Medical Officers training:
 Is a six-year professional degree programme accredited by the Medical Practitioners and Dentists Board involving
 Two years of pre-clinical training in medical sciences followed by
 Four years of training in clinical medicine, surgery and community health including a mandatory one-year internship and
 Registration, licensing and gazettment by the Medical Practitioners and Dentists Board giving
 Unlimited practice rights with
 Specialisation and private practice allowed and eligible for full professional membership of the Kenya Medical Association (KMA)

Clinical Officers training:
 Is a four or five-year professional diploma or degree programme accredited by the Clinical Officers Council involving 
 One year of pre-clinical training in medical sciences followed by
 Three or four years of training in clinical medicine, surgery and community health including a mandatory one-year internship and
 Registration, licensing and gazettment by the Clinical Officers Council giving
Unlimited practice rights with
 Specialisation and private practice allowed and eligible for full professional membership of the Kenya Clinical Officers Association (KCOA)

The current training follows international guidelines and the two qualifications are awarded jointly on successful completion of a comprehensive nine trimester programme of full-time study, practicals and examinations which are covered over three years leading to a fourth mandatory year of internship in a teaching hospital. A fifth and sixth residency specialisation years are undertaken after registration by the Clinical Officers Council and three years of work experience in general medicine which leads to the award of a general degree in clinical medicine or a specialist diploma in pediatrics, orthopedics, psychiatry, anaesthesia, reproductive health and other specialties.

A clinical officer is therefore able to graduate and join the workforce in a minimum of four calendar years and provides medical services within the full scope of family and emergency medicine or within a narrower scope depending on their area of specialisation.

Registration by the Clinical Officers Council (COC) entitles one to render medical services in any public or private medical institution or to practice medicine independently as a private practitioner. Registration also qualifies one to join and participate in the affairs of the Kenya Clinical Officers Association (KCOA), including its annual KCOA Scientific Conference, and the Kenya Union of Clinical Officers (KUCO). As per the government's Revised Scheme of Service for Clinical Personnel (2014) a clinical officer works at any of 8 grades depending on ones seniority.

As gazetted officers all registered clinical officers are legally authorized to prepare, sign, issue and keep safe custody of official state documents such as medical examination reports, sick notes, postmortem examination reports and death certificates and to appear in courts of law as expert witnesses. For this reason, a clinical officer is the officer in-charge of a health center or a district hospital and is part of the medical team in bigger hospitals where one may head a department or work under a senior clinical officer or a physician.

Clinical officers are direct healthcare providers who manage and administer health institutions, medical schemes and projects in primary healthcare (PHC) settings and are frontline stakeholders in Universal Health Coverage in Kenya which is one of the key pillars of the government's 5-year development plan under President Uhuru Kenyatta. The four pillars of the 5-year development plan are 1. Manufacturing 2. Affordable housing 3. Universal Health Coverage and 4. Food security.

Legal status
In Kenya's public health system, a clinical officer is an alternative practitioner who is trained and authorized by law to perform any technical, administrative or legal duties that require a medical doctor. However, due to the shorter training period when compared to medical officers (i.e. 4 years instead of 6 years), a clinical officer joins the public service at a lower grade and gains seniority through experience, additional training or further education.

Like the term medical officer, the term clinical officer is a protected title whose use without the authority of the Clinical Officers Council is prohibited and a punishable offense under Kenyan laws. Court rulings uphold that a registration certificate or a licence issued by the council automatically confers the status of a medical officer or a qualified medical practitioner to a clinician and the titles are used interchangeably in medico-legal documents because a qualified clinical officer has a recognized medical qualification and is eligible for registration as a medical practitioner under Section 11(1) of the Medical Practitioners and Dentists Act in addition to being expressly authorized to practice medicine, surgery or dentistry by Section 7(4) of the Clinical Officers ActCriminal Appeal 198 of 2008 - Kenya LawCriminal Case 6 of 2004 - Kenya LawCAP. 249

From the Anatomy Act, the legal definition of a medical officer is any public officer who is entitled to be registered as a medical practitioner if he applied under any law in the country: Section 14(1) of the Medical Practitioners and Dentists Act and Section 7(4) of the Clinical Officers Act are the only two laws that can authorize one to practice medicine and render medical or dental services in the public sector if they hold a registration certificate or in the private sector if they hold a current licence as well. The Public Health Act further defines a medical officer of health as a public officer who is responsible for health nationally (the Director of Medical Services and the Director clinical services) or regionally (the county or sub-county Medical Officer of Health and the county or sub-county Clinical Officer).

Like his counterparts in the public service, a clinical officer in the private sector has the same practice rights and privileges as a medical officer and both are authorized to work independently and specialize in any approved branch of general or specialised medicine. The Competition Act No.12 of 2010 directly prohibits and addresses multi-sectoral abuse of dominance, consumer welfare, exemptions, cartels and unwarranted concentration of economic power among practitioners.

A register of active clinical officers and medical institutions is available online on the Clinical Officers Council and Ministry of Health websites.

The Clinical Officers (Training, Registration and Licensing) Act No. 20 of 2017

The Clinical Officers (Training, Registration and Licensing) Act No.20 of 2017 is the law that governs the medical practice of a clinical Officer. It establishes the Clinical Officers Council whose functions are to:
advise the government on policy matters relating to clinical medicine practice
prescribe the minimum educational entry requirements for persons wishing to be trained as clinical officers
approve institutions other than those established or accredited under the Universities Act, 2012 for the training of clinical officers
establish, approve and accredit programs for continuing professional educational programs
register and license clinical officers for the purposes of this Act
maintain a register and records of all clinical officers registered under this Act
cause to be published in the Kenya Gazette every calendar year the names of all registered clinical officers
promote development and adoption of codes of practice
regulate the professional conduct and ensure the maintenance and improvement of the standards of practice of clinical medicine
collaborate with other medical professional associations, organisations and other relevant bodies, in the furtherance of the functions of the council and those bodies
consider and deal with any other matter pertaining to clinical officers including prescribing badges, insignias or uniforms to be worn by clinical officers and
carry out other functions related to the implementation of this Act.

Training

Although training programmes existed as early as 1928, the first university to train clinical officers was Egerton University in 1999. Programs also exist at Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology, Kenya Methodist University (KEMU) Mt Kenya University. and Presbyterian university of East Africa (PUEA)., and Meru University of Science and Technology (MUST). The diploma in Clinical Medicine and Surgery is completed in nine 15-week trimesters over three calendar years (or 135 weeks which, notably, exceeds the minimum 130 weeks of instruction required to complete US MD programs). The BSc. Clinical Medicine and Surgery is completed over 4 years.

Students study the biomedical and clinical sciences such as anatomy, physiology and pathology in the first year followed by the clinical subjects (medicine, surgery, pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology) in the second year. The third and fourth year involves supervised clinical practice and internship in teaching hospitals where they rotate in all the departments, receive beside lectures, attend consultants' ward rounds, clerk patients and present medical histories, perform deliveries and first-assist in major surgery. They also attend clinical meetings and write prescriptions which at this stage must be counter-signed by a supervising clinician.

There is special emphasis on primary care with modules on community health taught throughout the course. Before starting their internship after the third year, clinical officers spend at least one month in a Provincial Rural Health Training Centre where they immunize children, examine pregnant women and offer family planning services in mother and child health clinics. They also treat in-patients and out-patients under the guidance of qualified Clinical officers and organise outreach services where they venture into remote rural villages, seeing patients and immunising children. During this time they complete a project in community diagnosis.

They also learn Health Service Management which prepares them for their management and leadership roles in health centers and other institutions.

Internship and registration

All clinical officers must work as full-time interns for one year without pay or any form of motivation at an approved public or mission hospital before getting a licence to practice medicine, a situation that has resulted to major strikes by clinical officers in the past leading to operation standstills in public hospitals when these strikes occur. On passing the final qualifying examination, they take the hippocratic oath then apply for provisional registration by the Clinical Officers Council, the statutory body that regulates the practice of clinical officers in the country. The internship involves supervised rotations in the major clinical departments namely casualty, medicine, paediatrics, surgery, obstetrics and gynecology. They are supervised by consultants in the respective fields. The consultants ensure that they can practice clinical medicine safely before signing them off for registration. An internship booklet signed by the consultants is required for registration. After registration one is required to apply for a licence from the COC which allows them to practice medicine, surgery and dentistry legally in the country. This licence is renewable every two years. Renewal requires evidence of having attained 60 Continuous Professional Development (CPD) points in the CPD diary by further training, research and publications, attending conferences and Continuing Medical Education (CME) sessions or major ward rounds and outreach activities.

Careers Progression

An experienced clinical officer usually holds a senior clinical, administrative or teaching position within their organisation or establishes and manages his/her own private practice. One who holds the Diploma in Clinical Medicine and Surgery can upgrade his/her qualification to the BSc. Clinical Medicine and Surgery or undertake postgraduate training at the university. One may also enroll for the Higher Diploma programme at the Kenya Medical Training College.

The Higher Diploma in Clinical Medicine and Surgery requires at least three years of working experience and lasts twelve to eighteen months leading to a specialised qualification and re-designation as a specialised clinical officer in one of the medical specialties such as paediatrics, reproductive health, anaesthesia, ENT, ophthalmology and cataract surgery, orthopaedics, psychiatry/clinical psychology, skin and chest diseases, epidemiology, pathology and Community medicine. A specialised clinical officer provides advanced medical and surgical care including invasive procedures in their specialty such as caeserian section, cataract surgery, tonsillectomy, psychotherapy and administration of anaesthesia.

Malawi
Medical care is generally provided by clinical officers who are even capable of providing surgical care. Clinical Officers are trained for 4 years, (3+1 year of clinical internship at designated teaching hospitals). One meta-analysis documented that the provision of caesarean section by clinical officers does not result in a significant increase in maternal or perinatal mortality. In other, words there was no difference whether the operation was done by clinical officers or medical doctor

Sudan
Southern Sudan separated from the Arab North (Sudan) in July 2011 after years of civil war that left much of the southern part in ruins. The healthcare system is almost non-existent. AMREF started training clinical officers by setting up the Maridi National Health Training Institute, name=""AMREF""/>

The graduates supplement the efforts of COs trained in neighboring countries, e.g. Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania, most of whom work for international humanitarian agencies.
Since 2014, Juba institute of Health Sciences and Ayii University 2021 have now joined in production of competent cadres in the Health in the Republic of South Sudan.

Tanzania
In Tanzania, training is under the Ministry of Health. There are numerous clinical officer training schools and programs last three years. Internship is not required for registration.

Experienced clinical officers may enrol for an advanced diploma in clinical medicine which takes two years to complete. This qualification is regarded as equivalent to a first degree in medicine by universities and the Ministry of Health in the country. The graduates are known as Assistant Medical Officers which no longer exist since 2017 so a clinical officer can upgrade by studying a bachelor's degree in clinical medicine in any East African country for three years or study it in Tanzania for four years and graduate as a doctor equivalent to an MD graduate even in salary and job opportunities or can study the Medical Doctor(MD) which is a 5-year course plus 1 internship year making 6 years and can add 1 year to be Medical bachelor and Bachelor in Surgery (MBBS) if interested.

 A further two years training from the Clinical Officer level leads to a specialist qualification in anaesthesia, medicine, surgery and radiology etc.

Kampala International University has opened a campus in Dar es Salaam where it is now offering its Bachelor of Clinical Medicine and Community Health.

Uganda
By 1918, Uganda was training clinical officers who were called medical assistants at the time. The training is under the Ministry of Education and takes place in clinical officer training schools. Postsecondary programs last three years, focusing on medicine and hospice care, followed by a two-year internship.

Kampala International University offers a Bachelor of Clinical Medicine and Community Health. High school graduates take four-and-a-half years to complete this degree while practicing clinical officers take three years.

Zambia
In Zambia, clinical officers who complete a three-year diploma of Science in Clinical Medicine course are called CLINICAL OFFICER -GENERAL (COG). Those who complete a three-year diploma in clinical psychiatry are called CLINICAL OFFICER -PSYCHIATRY (COP). Currently the upgrade of this diploma is a Bachelor of Science and holders are called medical licentiates. Medical licentiates have advanced skills in medicine and surgery and may be deployed interchangeably with physicians. Medical licentiates outnumber general physicians (with university degree) across all regions, with the ratio ranging from 3.8 COs per physician in Lusaka to 19.3 in the Northwestern provinces. They perform routine surgical and obstetric operations as well as providing clinical care in hospitals. The College of Surgeons of East, Central and Southern Africa (COSECSA) is involved in their training to increase their surgical skills through the Clinical Officers Surgical Training (COST) programme.

Burkina Faso
In Burkina Faso, as elsewhere in sub-Saharan Africa, the use of non-physician clinicians began as a temporary measure while more doctors were trained, but has become a permanent strategy in the face of a crisis in health human resources. Different training alternatives have been used. Two-year advanced training programs in surgery were developed for registered nurses. Clinical officers (known as attachés de santé en chirurgie) were district medical officers trained with an additional six-month curriculum in emergency surgery.

Many studies show that trained COs provide quality medical and surgical care with outcomes similar to physicians' providing similar care in the same setting. However, nurses re-trained to become COs have been associated with more adverse outcomes as shown in a study using 2004-2005 hospital data from six regions of Burkina Faso, which associated them with higher maternal and neonatal mortality when they performed caesarian sections. The observed higher fatality rate pointed to a need for refresher courses and closer supervision of the nurses.

Ethiopia
The first medical school in Ethiopia was initially a ""health officer"" training institution. The training of health officers started at Gonder University in 1954. Health officers training programs across Ethiopia require that students have some of the highest scores in National University Entrance Examination to be admitted. Health officers hold bachelor's degrees and undergo a three-year training program plus one-year internship. Those who complete a 2–3 years master's degree programs provide advanced care (e.g. emergency surgery).

Ghana
In Ghana, Medical Assistants (MAs) have traditionally been experienced nurses who have undergone an 18-month post-basic course to become MAs. High school graduates can now attend a three-year diploma course to become MAs. In Ghana, from 2012, the nomenclature Medical Assistant had been changed to Physician Assistant.. The new name Physician Assistant is not known among most Ghanaians The term Physician Assistant (PA) refers to three distinct groups of health professionals trained on the medical model to practise medicine and dentistry. They are the PA-Medical, PA-Dental and also known as Community Oral Health Officers and PA-Anaesthesia (also known as Nurse Anesthetists). These groups of mid-level health providers were trained exclusively in the past by Health Training Institutions (HTIs) under the Ministry of Health with the aim of extending care to the populace where physician numbers were scanty or not present. Currently, there are eight universities in Ghana offering a 4-year Bachelor of Science degree in Physician Assistantship. The objective of the Bachelor of Physician Assistantship programme is to train graduates who will possess the ability to evaluate the health status of an individual, diagnose and treat acute illness as well as life saving interventions, manage chronic diseases, deliver preventive care and counsel individuals on psychosocial problems in independently or in collaboration with a physician.

In 2016, the PA-Anaesthesia group broke away and became certified registered anaesthetist (CRA) according to the Health Professions Regulatory Acts 857 which addressed them as certified registered anaesthetist. PAs are qualified by graduation from the PA educational programme and certification by the Ghana Medical and Dental Council. Newly qualified PAs who are successful in their licentiate examinations by the MDC are issued with provisional registrations to enable them undertake one-year internship in an accredited institution, a prerequisite for permanent registration which would also serve as national service but without pay for the twelve months.

PA students in all PA training schools belong to the Physician Assistant Association of Ghana (PASAG). In order to foster unity, camaraderie and bond among members of the association, and to promote excellence in the discharge of their professional mandate, quiz competitions are held every year. The maiden edition was won by the Presbyterian University College, Ghana. After permanent certification, among other things, PAs diagnose and treat illnesses, conduct physical examinations, counsel individuals on preventative health issues, and order and interpret laboratory tests. In addition, PAs are first or second assistants in major surgery, and provide pre- and post-operative care, and for that matter are trained and well versed in surgical skills. Thus, PAs play roles in preventive Medicine, as well as in educational, research, and administrative activities. The physician assistant is part of the medical team and is placed above the nurse but below the medical officer They perform tasks originally performed by doctors. Some call PAs as ""village doctors"" or ""chiefs."" To the patient, a PA is a doctor, since the PA practises medicine just as a doctor

The Ghana Physician Assistant Association-Medical at their last annual delegate congress, voted for a name change from the current name Physician Assistant to Clinical Officer. The members of the association believes that the Assistant attached to their name is limitation to what the PA actually does. The PA is not an assistant but an independent medical professional trained and licensed to practise medicine and dentistry. The association has therefore presented a new job description and the new name clinical officer to the Ministry of Health. The meeting which was chaired by the chief director of the ministry of health Dr. Afisah Zakariah who promised to address the grievances of the PAs soon to be known as Clinical Officers

Liberia
In Liberia, the Tubman National Institute of Medical Arts (TNIMA) was established in 1945. In 1965, the physician assistant (PA) programme was established as a joint venture between the Liberian government, WHO and UNICEF. Initially it was a one-year course, but currently it is a three-year diploma course accredited by the Liberia National Physician Assistant Association (LINPAA) and the Liberia Medical and Dental Association Board. In order to legally practice medicine as a PA one must sit and pass a state exam administered by the medical board.

Mozambique

In Mozambique, tecnicos de cirurgia, or surgical technologists, are experienced Clinical Officers who undergo further residential training in surgery under the supervision of senior surgeons lasting two years at Maputo Central Hospital, and a one-year internship at a provincial hospital. They are trained to carry out emergency surgery, obstetrics and traumatology and are deployed to the district hospitals where they are usually the sole surgical care providers.

South Africa

South Africa trains clinical associates for three years and awards them the Bachelor of Clinical Medical Practice degree. The first program was launched by the late Health Minister Tshabalala Msimang on 18 August 2008 at the Walter Sisulu University in Mthatha. The first class graduated in December 2010. Programs also exist at the University of Pretoria and the University of the Witwatersrand.

International
The specialised nature of medical training in the developed world has created a shortage of general practitioners and runaway expenditure on healthcare by governments. primary care is increasingly being provided by non-physician providers such as physician assistants.

United States

Physician assistants in the United States train for at least two years at the postsecondary level and can hold an associate, bachelors or master's degree. Most PAs have earned a master's degree. Some institutions offer a Doctor of Science degree in the same. The profession is represented by the American Academy of Physician Assistants.

United Kingdom
The United Kingdom has in recent years employed physician assistants from the United States on a trial basis as it plans to introduce this cadre into their health care system. Several UK universities are already offering a post-graduate diploma in Physician Assistant studies. The PAs of the UK are represented by the Association of UK PAs.

Australia

The University of Queensland offers a one-and-a-half-year Master of Physician Assistant Studies to those with a bachelor's degree. Those with a post-secondary healthcare qualification such as registered nurses and paramedics can access the programme via a Graduate Certificate in Physician Assistant Studies; as long as they have at least five years full-time working experience. It has been announced that PAs will be allowed to work in Queensland as fully licensed practitioners in 2014.

China
China has about 880,000 Rural Doctors and 110,000 assistant doctors who provide primary care to rural populations where they are also known as barefoot doctors. They typically have about one year of training; those who sit and pass government examinations qualify to be rural doctors. Those who fail become community health workers. However, there is a government move to have all rural doctors complete three years training.

Fiji
Africa and the rest of the world are perhaps following a well trode path. In 1879, a group of Indians arrived in Fiji by ship having survived cholera and smallpox en route. During a period of crew quarantine, a small group was trained in vaccination. The experience was considered so successful that a few years later, in 1885, a group of young Fijian men started a three-year training program at the Suva Medical School, now known as the Fiji School of Medicine. The title given to the professional practice has had many names over the years, including Native Medical Practitioner, Assistant Medical Practitioner, Assistant Medical Officer, and Primary Care Practitioner (PCP). By 1987, the PCPs were training for three years before going back to their communities to serve one-year internship, followed by another two years of study after which they were awarded a MBBS degree.

India
Under British rule, India trained licentiate doctors for three years. They were then registered with the General Medical Council of Britain. Most of them worked among the rural population providing medical care.

After independence, and on the recommendation of the bhore committee in 1946, the training of licentiate doctors was stopped and their qualifications converted to MBBS degrees. They were then grandfathered into the Medical Council of India.

The plan was to train enough doctors who would serve the whole country. However, the plan has not borne fruit and doctors generally leave their rural posts after their internship for more lucrative and glamorous careers in the big cities.

As of 2009, the Indian government plans to introduce a three-and-a-half-year Bachelor of Rural Medicine and Surgery (BRMS) degree to train doctors who will work in remote Indian villages. On graduation they will undergo a one-year internship period at a regional hospital before being licensed. Those with five years' experience will qualify for post-graduate studies on equal standing with their MBBS counterparts.

In India, the Madras Medical Mission in Chennai, collaborating with Birla Institute of Technology and Frontier Lifeline has since 1992 offered a Bachelor of Science degree in Physician Assistant studies. The program duration is four years, comprising three years classroom and laboratory coursework then one year compulsory internship. Several other universities offer similar courses in partnership with US universities. PAs in India can pursue masters and doctor of science degrees.

Usha Researcher ?']","Usha C. V. Haley is an American author and academic, currently W. Frank Barton Distinguished Chair of International Business and Professor of Management at the W. Frank Barton School of Business at Wichita State University in the U.S. state of Kansas.  She is also Director of the Center for International Business Advancement at Wichita State University and elected Chair of the independent World Trade Council of Wichita. Prior to this, she was at other universities including West Virginia University, Massey University in New Zealand and at Harvard Kennedy School, Harvard University. Haley is credited with providing the intellectual foundations on understanding subsidies to Chinese industry with her book of the same name and testimonies, used as a basis for the current trade wars. See http://ushahaley.academia.edu. Born in Mumbai, India, she received a bachelor's degree in Politics at Elphinstone College, Mumbai and then went on to get graduate degrees from various American universities including a Master's from University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign in Political Science, and New York University, where she received Master's and PhD degrees in International Business and Strategy from the Stern School of Business. Besides the US, Dr. Haley has lived and worked in Mexico, Singapore, Australia, China, India, Vietnam, Thailand, Italy, Finland, Russia, New Zealand and several other countries.

Research
An expert on Asian and Emerging Markets, Dr. Haley's extensive research includes over 350 articles and presentations and 8 books that explore companies and business environments in India, China, Southeast Asia and Mexico as well as the societal impacts of business schools and their research. Her research on Subsidies to Chinese Industry has supported trade regulation in the United States and the European Union. She has also studied the effects of sanctions and trade barriers such as subsidies on the behaviors of companies and nations. Her research on boycotts, divestitures and regulations published in Multinational Corporations in Political Environments concluded that most sanctions had no effect on US corporate behaviors in South Africa. Her book, The Chinese Tao of Business highlighted the Chinese business environment and how companies operate there to enhance their profits. Her book New Asian Emperors analyzed business information for strategic decisions in Southeast Asia and the influence of networks. Her latest book is Impact and the Management Researcher which looks at how scholarly research is valued in academia and by society.

She is a frequent public speaker and expert on the talk and press circuit. Her research has been regularly profiled in the major media including the Wall Street Journal, (""U.S. Researcher Usha C.V. Haley's Study on Chinese Subsidies to its Glass Industry"", Aug 30, 2010) The Economist (""Survey of Asian Business"", April 7–13, 2001), CNN (""Special Report: Eye on China,"" May 18–19, 2005), Bloomberg News (""China Steel Makers get $27 Billion Subsidy,"" January 8, 2008), Barron's Magazine (""Foreign Carmakers keep up the Pressure on Detroit,"" October 22, 2001), USA Today (""Tech Start-Ups Don't Grow on Trees Outside USA"", June 28, 2006) the Wall Street Journal (""Could the Asian Crises Repeat?"", July 3, 2007), The New York Times, (""With New Urgency US and South Korea Seek Free Trade Deal"", January 16, 2007)  and BusinessWeek  (""The Art of Chinese Relationships"", January 6, 2006).

Activities
In August 2012, Usha Haley received the Academy of Management's Practice Impact Award for influential research with impact. The Academy of Management is the largest and oldest scholarly association in Management in the world.  In September 2011, Usha Haley delivered a Thought Leader presentation on business and government relations in China at the Economist's flagship High Growth Market Summit in London. Dr. Haley has received a life-time award from academic publisher Emerald for her contributions to the understanding of Business in the Asia-Pacific and serves on several corporate and governmental boards as well as academic journal editorial boards.

Haley has also testified numerous times before US Congress on her research on China, subsidies, emerging and transitional economies.  Included in these testimonies, in July 2013 Haley served as witness in the United States Senate hearing on Smithfield and beyond: Examining foreign purchases of American food companies. Citing food-safety violations, senior managers' connections to the Chinese Communist Party, Chinese government competitive stances, Chinese subsidies and research on Chinese strategy, Haley advocated against the takeover of Virginia-based Smithfield Foods by Chinese company Shuanghui on national-security grounds. In April 2006 she testified before the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission on the effects of Chinese government subsidies on US business operations in China. In March 2007, she testified before the United States House Committee on Ways and Means in support of the ground-breaking, US federal trade legislation, The Nonmarket Economy Trade Remedy Act of 2007. She has also presented her research on China before the U.S. International Trade Commission, the United States Trade Representative and the United States Department of Commerce.

Dr. Haley's research on Chinese subsidies to its domestic industry and China's business environment has provided support for US federal investigations and legislation on emerging markets as well as in anti-dumping litigation in the European Union and the USA. Her work on Chinese steel subsidies has been used in trade regulation in the European Union and Germany.

Responding to her research findings and to other testimony from business, on June 20, 2008, U.S. steel pipe manufacturers, who have been battling a surge in imports from China, won a major victory when the International Trade Commission cleared the way for the imposition of stiff penalty tariffs for the next five years. The commission voted 5-0 that the U.S. industry was being harmed by the import of circular steel pipe from China. The decision marked the first time a U.S. industry has won a decision to impose tariffs on a Chinese product based on the argument that the Chinese government was unfairly subsidizing a Chinese industry. The ruling means penalty tariffs ranging from 99 percent to 701 percent will be imposed on Chinese imports of circular welded pipe. For more than two decades, the U.S. government had refused to consider subsidy cases against the Chinese government because China was classified as a non-market economy.  However, the Bush administration, facing increasing anger over soaring trade deficits with China, reversed course in late 2007 and announced it would treat China in the same way as other countries in disputes involving government subsidies (""US Steel Industry Wins Trade Case against China"", Associated Press, June 20, 2008).

In October 2009, at the request of 8 U.S. senators from Pennsylvania, New York, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and Louisiana, her research on subsidies to China's industry was used by the US government to question Chinese trade and production practices in the US-China Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade (JCCT), th major venue for business and trade negotiations between the two countries. In addition to Senator Casey, the letter requesting the inclusion of her research in the US-China negotiations was also signed by Senator Charles Schumer (NY), Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (NY), Senator Arlen Specter (PA), Senator Sherrod Brown (OH), Senator Debbie Stabenow (MI), Senator Evan Bayh (IN) and Senator Mary Landrieu (LA).

In July 2010, drawing on her research on China's paper industry, 104 U.S. senators and Representatives wrote a bi-partisan letter to President Obama recommending action on China trade.

In January 2012, her research on subsidies to Chinese auto parts became part of a congressional effort to demand an inquiry into Chinese auto-parts production and effects on US jobs.  The bi-partisan effort is led by Senator Sherrod Brown (Ohio), Senator Debbie Stabenow (Michigan), industry groups and think tanks.

In 2012, her research on the evolution of the global energy industry has supported the Obama administration's and industry groups' successful levying of tariffs on Chinese solar panel imports into the USA.

In the last decade, her research has been incorporated in over 40 pieces of trade regulation in the USA, Europe and Asia

6340,['Heir Missing a You Are and Heirs Missing of Board The titles the by went also It ?'],"The Court of Missing Heirs is an American old-time radio human interest drama. It was broadcast on CBS October 11, 1937 - September 29, 1942 and on ABC March 31, 1946 - April 6, 1947. It also went by the titles The Board of Missing Heirs and Are You a Missing Heir?

Format
Each episode of The Court of Missing Heirs featured two dramatizations of real-life situations involving people who died leaving estates that had been unclaimed.

After having handled probate cases that involved unclaimed estates, attorney James Waters originally planned to use the concept of finding missing heirs in a book. When publishing companies rejected his manuscript, he adapted the idea to radio. Waters and Alfred Shebel used actual court records to conduct the research for each episode. In 1942, the program reached the $1 million mark in helping people collect legacies that had been unclaimed.

The program originated at WBBM in Chicago, Illinois, and was sponsored by Sterling Products.

Personnel
The program had no continuing characters. Actors frequently heard on it included Walter Kinsella, Kenny Delmar, Jeanette Nolan, Everett Sloane, and Carl Frank. The narrator was James Marshall.

Everard Wilson Meade and Alfred Shebel were producers. Directors were John Loveton, Charles Harrell, and Rodney Erickson. Ira Marion was the writer, and Rosa Rio provided the music.

6356,"['Home Coming "" of author , Grigoleit Grit ?']","The Hmong people are a major ethnic group in the Minneapolis–Saint Paul area. As of 2000 there were 40,707 ethnic Hmong in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area. The 2010 U.S. Census stated there were 66,000 ethnic Hmong in Minneapolis-St. Paul, giving it the largest urban Hmong population in the world. Grit Grigoleit, author of ""Coming Home? The Integration of Hmong Refugees from Wat Tham Krabok, Thailand, into American Society,"" wrote that the Minneapolis-St. Paul area ""acted as the cultural and socio-political center of Hmong life in the U.S.""

History

The Hmong, who were refugees, settled in Minnesota due to the actions of voluntary agencies (VOLAGS). Minnesota had many active VOLAGS who helped Hmong people when they arrived.

The University of Minnesota Agricultural Extension Services and the Lao Family Community established farming programs for Hmong in the early 1980s. The programs ended in 1985.

In 2004 Randy Kelly, the mayor of St. Paul, traveled to Thailand with a delegation of professionals and educators, most of them Hmong, to assess a community of Hmong refugees.

As of 2006, the Minneapolis-St. Paul area was expected to receive Hmong refugees from Wat Tham Krabok in Thailand.

Demographics
Data has shown a positive trend of Hmong-Americans gradually reducing the number of Hmong-American households that are considered to be living in poverty. In 2015, data from the Pew Research Center stated that 28.3% of all Hmong-American households lived in poverty. This trend is also reflected on Minnesotan Hmong communities. The 2011 American Community Survey report stated that 31% of Hmong in the state of Minnesota were considered to be in poverty. According to the 2000 U.S. Census data, 33% of Hmong people in Minnesota were considered to be in poverty. According to the 1990 U.S. Census data, 65% of Hmong people in Minnesota were considered to be in poverty.

Sometime during 2013, Mai M. Na Lee, the author of an encyclopedia article titled ""Hmong of Minnesota and California,"" wrote that despite a lack of official statistics, “there are reputedly many Hmong millionaires in the Twin Cities.”

As of 2013, over 50% of Hmong in the Minneapolis area owned their own houses.

Commerce
As of around 2013, the Hmong businesses in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area had revenues of over $100 million total.

As of 2011, several Hmong-owned businesses are located along West University Avenue in St. Paul.

Hmong Village, a complex with 250 merchant stalls and 20 restaurants, opened in 2009. Nine businesspeople had developed the complex.

In 2012, McDonald's introduced its first Hmong language advertising in the United States at a restaurant in  Minneapolis. However, it was unintelligible to Hmong speakers.

Institutions

By 2013, there were about ten Hmong nonprofit organizations in St. Paul.

The largest Hmong nonprofit group in the State of Minnesota is the Hmong American Partnership (HAP), headquartered in St. Paul. Founded in 1990, HAP is led by a board of up to 10 members. However, over the past few years, the group has experienced continual problems with financial oversight, which “appears to be both widespread and symptomatic of larger management struggles within HAP.” The problems were uncovered in a 2018 audit, and included issues such as:  persistent mismanagement of employee retirement accounts, failures to “provide services laid out in grant descriptions,” undisclosed revenue sources on submitted IRS forms, and “less than forthright financial practices.” Bao Vang, HAP's president and CEO who earned a base salary of $243,000 in 2017, defended her organization's practices—despite the budgetary controversies.

The Lao Family Community, headquartered in St. Paul, is the most established and oldest Hmong organization. Younger leaders began to leave the organization in the 1990s as a result of political disagreements. Mai M. Na Lee wrote that the organization “continues to monopolize festival events like the New Year's Festival and the Fourth of July Soccer Tournament.” She added that it is “not without scandal.”

The Center for Hmong Arts and Talents (CHAT), based in St. Paul, develops Hmong art and literature.

The Hmong Cultural Center is also in St. Paul.

Politics
When Choua Lee began serving as a member of the board of education of Saint Paul Public Schools in 1991, she became the first Hmong-American elected to public office in the area. The second official, Neal Thao, took Choua Lee's position in 1995. Neal Thao remained in this seat for seven years.

In 2000, Dr. Aly Xiong, a human rights activist and school principal, was the first Hmong-American to run for a Minnesota State Legislative seat, District 67B.  He lost to State Representative Sheldon Johnson, who served the east side of St. Paul for 20 years.

The Hmong Veterans' Naturalization Act of 2000 increased the number of Hmong eligible to vote, giving them more political power. In 2002, Cy Thao was elected to the Minnesota House of Representatives for District 65A and Mee Moua was elected to the Minnesota Senate for District 67.

The third Hmong-American to be elected to the St. Paul school board, Kazoua Kong-Thao, elected in 2003. Mee Moua's sister, Vallay Moua Varro, was elected to the St. Paul school board in 2009. This was the first time that two Hmong officials served concurrently on the St. Paul school board, since Kong-Thao was still in office. In 2013 Dai Thao defeated Kazoua Kong-Thao and six other candidates in a special election to become the first St. Paul City Councilmember of Hmong descent.

Mai M. Na Lee wrote circa 2013 that the Hmong have a significant political influence in St. Paul due to the size of the population. Beginning around 2000 Minnesotans campaigning for office have visited Hmong events to get the Hmong vote.

Media
The Hmong Today and Hmong Times, two Hmong newspapers, are headquartered in the Twin Cities area.

Education

As of 2000, statistics showed that 24% of Minnesotan Hmong had attained a high school diploma or its equivalent, 8% had a bachelor's degree and/or an associate degree, and 1% had a master's degree or further education. A reported 53% of Hmong in Minnesota had never received an education.

According to recorded enrollment data, the State of Minnesota had 22,000 students of Hmong origins. Minneapolis Public Schools and St. Paul Public Schools have large concentrations of Hmong students.

Minneapolis Public Schools operates the Hmong International Academy, a PreK–8 school catering to the Hmong community. There are additional Hmong-centric schools, such as the Hmong College Prep Academy, a K–12 charter school in Saint Paul. There is also the Hope Community Academy, a K–8 school located in Saint Paul that is open to all students, but has a focus on Hmong language and culture.

By 2011, increasing numbers of Hmong were attending universities and colleges. Many Hmong student associations have been formed within area universities and college campuses.

Culture and recreation
The Hmong New Year is celebrated in the metropolitan area. The 38th annual Hmong New Year in St. Paul was held in 2013.

The 41st Annual Minnesota Hmong New Year will be celebrated through the dates of November 30, 2020 to December 1, 2020 at the River Center in Saint Paul, Minnesota.

Due to the farming programs established in the 1980s, many Minnesotan Hmong had gained an interest in farming and agriculture.

Pom Siab Hmoob (Gazing into the Heart of the Hmong) Theatre, which is reportedly the world's first Hmong theater group, was formed in 1990. It is based in the Twin Cities. It is now known as the Center for Hmong Arts and Talent (CHAT).

The film Gran Torino by Clint Eastwood, though filmed in Michigan, stars five Minnesotan Hmong Americans, and the original story was based on a neighborhood in Minneapolis. It was the first mainstream U.S. film to feature Hmong Americans.

6409,['from Where include paintings his of Some ?'],"Wenzel August Hablik, also known as Wenceslav Hablik and Wilhelm August Hablik (4 August 1881 – 23 March 1934), was a painter, graphic artist, architect, designer, and craftsman of the early twentieth century, associated with German Expressionism.

Some of his paintings include Where from? Where to?, Starry Sky, Attempt, and Utopian Buildings.

Early life and education
Hablik was born in Brüx, Bohemia (now the city of Most in the Czech Republic). In later life he recalled that at the age of six, he found a specimen of crystal, and saw in it ""magical castles and mountains"" that would later appear in his art.

More pragmatically, he trained as a master cabinetmaker in bums. Teplitz, Vienna, and Prague.

Career 
He settled in Itzehoe, Germany in 1907, where he pursued architectural and interior design projects. Hablik produced designs for furniture, textiles, tapestries, jewelry, cutlery, and wallpapers. In 1917, he married German weaver and textile designer, Elisabeth Lindemann (1879–1960); they shared a workshop and studio in Itzehoe.

Hablik, a member of the Deutscher Künstlerbund, became best known, however, for his etchings and paintings and his links with major German Expressionist figures and movements, including the Arbeitsrat für Kunst (English: Workers Council for Art) and the Glass Chain movement. Hablik maintained a strong lifelong interest in crystals and geological forms generally. His visual art is notable for its highly imaginative and fanciful aspects; he created depictions of temples, flying cities, and crystal chasms.

In 1909, Hablik published his Creative Forces (""Schaffende Kräfte""), ""a portfolio of twenty etchings portraying a voyage through an imaginary universe of crystalline structures"" that ""represents the most significant accomplishment of his career."" Hablik also published other portfolios of his etchings, The Sea (""Das Meer"", 1918) and Architectural Cycle — Utopia (""Cyklus Architektur — Utopie,"" 1925). Some of Hablik's designs, particularly of lamps and small sculptures, relate to and express the ""utopian crystalline"" forms of his etchings.

A catalogue in the artist's autograph lists some 600 artworks; about 250 oil paintings by Hablik are known at present. He produced portraits, landscapes, nude figures, and pictures showing Symbolist influences. A tour of South America in 1925 to 1926 inspired him to create paintings of cactuses and flowers.

Hablik died at Itzehoe in 1934. The Wenzel Hablik Museum was established in the city of Itzehoe in 1995. The museum contains much of his art, as well as his collections of crystals and minerals, seashells and snails.

6486,"['modernity is What and consciousness leader On essays his , repatriation After ?', 'modernity is What In ?', 'modernity is What ?']","was a Japanese Sinologist.

Biography 
Yoshimi Takeuchi was a Sinologist, a cultural critic and translator. He studied Chinese author Lu Xun and translated Lu’s works into Japanese. His book-length study, Lu Xun (1944) ignited a significant reaction in the world of Japanese thought during and after the Pacific War. Takeuchi formed a highly successful Chinese literature study group with Taijun Takeda in 1934 and this is regarded as the beginning of modern Sinology in Japan. He was a professor at Tokyo Metropolitan University from 1953 to 1960 when he resigned in protest. He was known as a distinguished critic of Sino-Japanese issues and his complete works (vols. 17) were published by Chikuma Shobo during 1980-82.

In 1931, Takeuchi graduated from high school and entered the faculty of letters at Tokyo Imperial University, where he met his lifelong friend, Taijun Takeda. Together they formed the Chinese Literature Research Society (Chugoku Bungaku Kenkyukai) and in 1935, they published an official organ for the group, Chugoku Bungaku Geppo in order to open up the study of contemporary Chinese literature as opposed to the ""old-style"" Japanese Sinology. During 1937 to 1939 he studied abroad in Beijing where he became depressed due to the  geo-political situation and drank a lot. In 1940, he changed the title of the official organ from Chugoku Bungaku Geppo to Chugoku Bungaku in which he published a controversial article, ""The Greater East Asia War and our resolve"" in January 1942. In January 1943, he broke up the Chinese Literature Research Society and decided to discontinue the publication of Chugoku Bungaku despite the group becoming quite successful. In December, he was called up for the Chinese front and stayed there until 1946. This encounter what he saw as the real living China and Chinese people, as opposed to the abstract China of his studies, made a deep impression on him. He threw himself into a study of the modern colloquial language and during this time, his maiden work was published, the book-length study Lu Xun (1944).

After repatriation, his essays On leader consciousness and What is modernity? became the focus of public attention in 1948 during the Japanese occupation. It is from such essays that his status as an important postwar critic was gradually acknowledged. After 1949, he was greatly moved by the foundation of the People's Republic of China (PRC) and he continued to refer to the PRC in his articles and books. In 1953, he became a full professor at Tokyo Metropolitan University, a post he eventually resigned from in protest after Prime Minister Kishi Nobusuke rammed the revised U.S.-Japan Security Treaty through the National Diet with only members of his own party present in May 1960 despite the massive Anpo Protests expressing popular opposition to the new treaty. During the anti-treaty struggle, Takeuchi played a leading role as one of the foremost intellectuals in postwar Japan under the slogan he coined: ""democracy or dictatorship?"" From 1963, he argued in favor of Mao Zedong and the Chinese Cultural Revolution in his magazine Chugoku published by Chugoku no Kai until the diplomatic normalization between Japan and the PRC (1972). He was particularly interested in Mao's ""Philosophy of base/ground"" (konkyochi tetsugaku) which involves the principle of making one's enemy one's own. For Takeuchi, this was similar to Lu Xun's notion of cheng-cha, or endurance/resistance. In his later years, Takeuchi devoted himself to doing a new translation of Lu Xun's works.

Yu Dafu
In his graduation thesis, Takeuchi discussed Yu Dafu. He concluded:

Yu Dafu—he was an agonal poet. He pursued self-agony with a sincere manner and brought abnormal influence in the Chinese literary world by coming to light in bold expression. Because his agony sums up his young contemporaries' agony.

""Not <politics> (accommodating oneself to external authority) but <literature> (digging down self-agony). Yu Dafu did not reign over the people but was connected with others' agony. Takeuchi described his style as 'art of the strength that devoting oneself solely to weakness'.""

Japan as a humiliation

Shina and Chugoku
Takeuchi felt guilty about the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937. At that time, Tokyo called China as not ""Shina"" but ""Chugoku"" for directing friendship between Japan and the Wang Jingwei regime. In Japanese, ""Shina"" is a discriminatory word for China. Takeuchi attempted to culturally resist such a manner in a period of a total war.

However, as he knew the Greater East Asia War was also to some extent intended and characterized as a war to liberate East and Southeast Asian nations, Takeuchi pathetically declared his resolve (1942) for what he saw as a war of justice, which is generally interpreted as his cooperation with the war effort. After defeat in 1945, however, he knew that the declared aims of the war were deceptive and he tried to explain its aporias of both the liberation of colonies and anti-imperialism.

Overcoming modernity
""Overcoming modernity"" was one of the catchwords that took hold of Japanese intellectuals during the war. Or perhaps it was one of the magic words. ""Overcoming modernity"" served as a symbol that was associated with the ""Greater East Asian War"". 

In denouncing the intelligentsia for their wartime collaboration, it is common to lump these two symposiums together. 

Rather my task is to distinguish among the symbolization of the symposiums, its ideas, and those who exploited these ideas. 

It is difficult if not virtually impossible to strip the ideology from ideas, or to extract the ideas from ideology. But we must recognize the relative independence of ideas from the systems or institutions that exploit them, we must risk the difficulty of distinguishing the actual ideas. Otherwise it would be impossible to draw forth the energy buried within them. In other words, it would be impossible to form tradition. 

After the defeat of 1945, Japanese journalism was full of discussion surrounding the issue of war responsibility, particularly that intellectuals and a famous wartime symposium entitled ""Overcoming Modernity"" which involved literary critic, Kobayashi Hideo and Kyoto-school philosopher, Nishida Kitaro. Wartime intellectuals were classified into three groups: Literary World, the ""Japanese Romantics"" (such as Yasuda Yojiro) and the Kyoto School. The ""Overcoming Modernity"" symposium was held in wartime Japan in (1942) and sought to interpret Japanese imperialism’s Asian mission in a positive historical light, as not any kind of simple fawning on Fascism, but rather ultimately, a step in the proper direction of Japan's destiny as an integral part of Asia. This was only a step, however, as, according to Takeuchi, while highlighting the aporias of modernity, the ""Overcoming Modernity"" debates failed to make those aporias themselves the subject of thought.

Critic Odagiri Hideo criticized the symposium as an ""ideological campaign consisting in the defense and theorization of the militaristic tennō state and the submission to its war system"". His view was accepted widely in post-war Japan. However, Takeuchi strongly opposed this easy pseudo-leftist formula.

The Pacific War's dual aspects of colonial invasion and anti-imperialism were united, and it was by this time impossible to separate these aspects. 

For the Kyoto School, it was dogma that was important; they were indifferent to reality. I don't even think that they represented a ""defense of the fait accompli that might makes right."" These philosophers disregarded the facts. 

Yasuda was at one and the same time a ""born demagogue"" and a ""spiritual treasure""; he could not have been a spiritual treasure were he not also a demagogue. This is the Japanese spirit itself. Yasuda represents something illimitable, he is an extreme type of Japanese universalist from which there is no escape. ... The intellectual role played by Yasuda was that of eradicating thought through the destruction of all categories. ... This may be the voice of heaven or earth, but it is not human language. It must be a revelation of the ""souls of our Imperial ancestors."" There is not even any usage of the ""imperial we."" This is a medium. And the role that everyone had ""eagerly anticipated"" was that of the medium itself, who appears at the end as the ""lead actor in a great farce."" Yasuda played this role brilliantly. By destroying all values and categories of thought, he relieved the thinking subject of all responsibility. 

Kobayashi Hideo was able to divest all meaning from facts, but he could not go beyond this. Literary World could only wait for the ""medium"" that was Yasuda to come and announce the disarmament of ideas. 

In sum, the ""Overcoming Modernity"" symposium marked the final attempt at forming thought, an attempt that, however, failed. Such formation of thought would at least take as its point of departure the aim of transforming the logic of total war. It failed in that it ended in the destruction of thought. 

In wartime 1942, Takeuchi declared a resolve on the war without fanatical chauvinism. In the postwar, Takeuchi's discussion was centred on the dual aspects of the Greater East Asia War. He attempted to resist war characteristics by using his own logic. However, for him, the wartime symposiums failed in the end. ""Overcoming Modernity"" resulted in scholastic chaos. Kobayashi Hideo of Literary World, who beat ""World-Historical Standpoint"" of the Kyoto School, was unworthy at this time. On behalf of such Kobayashi, Yasuda Yojuro of the Japanese Romantics showed only contempt.

National literature criticism
During 1951 to 1953, Takeuchi argued with literary critic, Sei Itō over the nature of a national literature (cf. Treaty of San Francisco). In 1954, Takeuchi published Kokumin Bungaku-ron [Theory of a national literature]. He criticized Japanese modernism for avoiding the problem of the ""nation"". Takeuchi envisaged national literature as needing to address the aporia of the nation as a cultural practice.

Foresight and mistakes
In 1960, the Japanese government rammed a revised version of the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security through the House of Representatives. Takeuchi saw it undemocratic and he decided to resign as professor of Tokyo Metropolitan University. Takeuchi attempted to generalize war experiences of the Japanese people to establish Japanese democratic subjectivity. As a result, he failed to accomplish his goal. Takeuchi said, ""Now, I think the Japanese nation will die out. Maybe, there is a possibility to be restored to life in the future. However, Japan is stateless in the present.""

""Asia as method""

Lu Xun
""According to Takeuchi, the core part of Lu Xun 'is awareness of the literature which was acquired through a confrontation with politics'. Literature in itself is directly powerless. However, as a result, literature could be involved in politics by devoting literature to literature. A writer could be powerful if he would dig down mental ""darkness"" and realize self-denial and self-innovation without dependence. Lu Xun was aware of this, so Takeuchi calls it ""reform"" ('eshin').

Chinese modernity and Japanese modernity
For Takeuchi, Japanese society was authoritarian and discriminatory. Takeuchi criticized Japanese modernists and modernization theorists who adopted a stopgap measure and recognized Japan as superior to Asia aiming at though revolutions. Takeuchi argued that Chinese modernity qualitatively surpassed the Japanese model. However, those modernists looked down on Asia and concluded Japan was not Asian. Generally speaking, the Japanese Meiji modernists had a tendency to interpret Asia as backward.

For Takeuchi, Japan and his greatest ""darkness"" were nothing but the issue of war responsibility. In What is modernity? (1948), Takeuchi stated:

""Ultranationalism and Japanism were once fashionable. These were to have banished Europe; they were not to have banished the slave structure that accommodates Europe. Now modernism is fashionable as a reaction against these ideologies, but the structure that accommodates modernity is still not problematized. Japan, in other words, attempts to replace the master; it does not seek independence. This is equivalent to treating Tojo Hideki as a backward student, so that other honor students remain in power in order to preserve the honor student culture itself.  It is impossible to negate Tojo by opposing him: one must go beyond him. To accomplish this, however, one must even utilize him.""

""<Class-A war criminals> and <Non-class-A war criminals> are supplement relations. It is meaningless to declare 'Japanism' to oppose with the West. Likewise, it is meaningless to declare Western modernism to oppose with 'Japanism'. In order to deny <Tojo>, you must not oppose with <Tojo> and must surpass <Tojo> by facing up to your image of <Tojo>. And it was equal to war-time Takeuchi himself who adopted <December 8> and criticized the Greater East Asia Writers' Congress.

Japanese Asianism
Takeuchi admitted modern Japanese Asianism ended with an empty official slogan ""Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere"" and Japanese defeat of 1945 after all. In post-war Japan, the Greater East Asia War thoroughly denied at all. Takeuchi questioned Japanese pacifism which led to lose the attitudes and responsibilities towards Asia as an Asian nation. Takeuchi depressed such a situation. He set to reviewing Japanese modern history through Asianism.

Takeuchi edited an anthology of Asianism in which he commented that Asianism is not an ideology but a trend and that it is impossible to distinguish between ""invasion"" and ""solidarity"" in Japanese Asianism. He explained that ""Asianism"" originated from Tokichi Tarui and Yukichi Fukuzawa in the 1880s. The former Tarui argued for unionizing Japan and Korea equally to strengthen Greater East Asian security. Takeuchi appreciated Tarui's work as an unprecedented masterpiece. The latter Fukuzawa argued for Japan casting off Asia who was barbarian and vulgar company. Takeuchi appreciated Fukuzawa's article as a stronger appeal to the public than Tarui's. The victories of the First Sino-Japanese War and the Russo-Japanese War made Japanese solidarity with Asia further and further. After the victories of the above wars, Japan inclined to build a ""new order"" in East Asia. Japan could not be a hope of Asia. Takeuchi indicated Japanese structural defect derived from wrong honours. He interpreted Japanese Asianism as Ko-A (raising Asia) taken over Datsu-A (casting off Asia).

For Takeuchi, Asia is not a geographical concept but a concept against ""modern Europe"", and so, Japan is non-Asian. When the Japanese accomplish to overcome modernity, they can be Asian. By ""modern Europe"", it is feudal class society full of discrimination and authoritarianism. ""Asia"" could be liberation from imperialism, which cut off a relationship between dominant and subject. Perhaps, his views were non-realist and progressive in a sense.

Takeuchi wished Japan to be Asianized. The concept of Asia is nothing but an ideal for him. He said: ""In a political dimension, post-war Bandung conference made an idea of Asianness in history"". Referring to Rabindranath Tagore and Lu Xun, Takeuchi addressed:

Rather the Orient must re-embrace the West, it must change the West itself in order to realize the latter's outstanding cultural values on a greater scale. Such a rollback of culture or values would create universality. The Orient must change the West in order to further elevate those universal values that the West itself produced. This is the main problem facing East-West relations today, and it is at once a political and cultural issue.

The origin of peace
After 1945, Takeuchi has called upon the normalization between China and Japan. In 1972, the Joint Communiqué of the Government of Japan and the Government of the People's Republic of China was concluded. Takeuchi criticized the Japanese attitudes towards the past. The issues of history have been a big concern in the Sino-Japanese relations.

6573,['( Șerban II Constantin ?'],"Constantin II Șerban (? – 1682) was Prince of Wallachia  between 1654 and 1658, illegitimate son to Radu Şerban. According to custom, being born out of wedlock did not disqualify Constantin from becoming prince.

Reign

His rule saw the rebellion of the seimeni mercenaries (1655). In order to deal with the issue, Constantin Şerban allied himself with the Transylvanian Prince George II Rákóczi, including himself in the latter's plans for emancipation from Ottoman rule.

In 1657, the Porte deposed him; Constantin Şerban went on to fight alongside Rákóczi, managing to upset Ottoman presence in Moldavia and briefly occupying the throne in Iaşi, at two different moments (in 1659 and 1661). Paul of Aleppo documents the derelict state of Wallachia during the Ottoman intervention, including an account of the rural population fleeing for the Transylvanian Alps (""where the Wallachians were accustomed to take refuge in time of need"").

In 1656, the Prince ordered the building of the Bucharest Metropolitan Cathedral (today: Patriarchal), partly modeled on the Curtea de Argeş Monastery – but larger and more austere. In his honour, the church was given the patronage of Eastern Orthodox Saints Constantine (his namesake) and Helena. In 1658, he set fire to the city, trying to prevent his adversary Mihnea III from making use of its facilities.

Federal Triangle is occupied by 10 large city and federal office buildings, all of which are part of the Pennsylvania Avenue National Historic Site. Seven of the buildings in Federal Triangle were built by the U.S. federal government in the early and mid-1930s as part of a coordinated construction plan that has been called ""one of the greatest building projects ever undertaken"" and all seven buildings are now designated as architecturally historic. The Federal Triangle Washington Metro station serves Federal Triangle and the surrounding area.

Name
The name ""Federal Triangle"" appears to have been a journalistic invention.  The press made reference to a ""Pennsylvania Avenue Triangle"" as early as November 18, 1926, and use of this name continued as late as June 1929, but it was more common for the news media to refer to the area as ""the Triangle"" by 1927. This name was in use by 1928, even by government officials, and still used as of late 1934.

The Associated Press first used the term ""Federal Triangle"" (with both words capitalized) in 1935. The New York Times first used the term in 1936, although the paper's capitalization of both words did not become standardized until 1939. Definitions of the area also varied at first.  Early news reports believed the eastern apex of Federal Triangle extended as far east and south as the Ulysses S. Grant Memorial in front of the United States Capitol. But almost all reports referred to Pennsylvania Avenue NW and 15th Street NW as the Triangle's northern and western boundaries.

Genesis and design

Plan

The Senate Park Commission (also known as the ""McMillan Commission"") was formed by the United States Congress in 1900 to reconcile competing visions for the development of Washington, D.C. and especially the National Mall and nearby areas. The Commission's plan for development, the McMillan Plan, proposed the razing of all residences and other buildings on Lafayette Square and building tall, Neoclassical government office buildings with facades of white marble around the park to house executive branch offices. While the demolition of some nearby buildings occurred (notably the Hay-Adams Houses, Corcoran House, and a portion of the Decatur House grounds), the rapid expansion in the size and number of executive branch agencies in the 1910s, 1920s, and 1930s made the McMillan Plan's development of Lafayette Square impractical.

Congressional and local support for the redevelopment of Lafayette Square waned significantly. Over the next few years, the President and Congress established several new agencies to supervise the approval, design, and construction of new buildings in the District of Columbia: The Commission of Fine Arts in 1910 (to approve the design of new structures), the Public Buildings Commission in 1916 (to make recommendations regarding the housing of federal agencies and offices), and the National Capital Parks and Planning Commission in 1924 (to oversee planning for the District). In the mid-1910s, Congress appropriated and the government spent $7 million to acquire land on Pennsylvania Avenue NW between 14th and 15th Streets NW and several blocks south. No demolition or construction took place during that period, and the government merely collected rent from the tenants in the area. In 1924, the Public Buildings Commission recommended that a new series of federal office buildings be built near the White House. The plan called for a complex of buildings to be built at Murder Bay—a muddy, flood-prone, malaria-ridden, poverty-stricken region lacking in paved roads, sewer system, and running water and almost exclusively home to numerous brothels and an extensive criminal underclass.

1926
Federal Triangle (as the area would be renamed) had its genesis in 1926.  An attempt to provide $50 million to fund, among other things, a national archives building and develop federal offices along Pennsylvania Avenue NW was proposed in 1925. The effort saw success in 1926 with the passage by the United States Congress of the Public Buildings Act, which authorized the construction not only of the Federal Triangle complex of buildings but also a new U.S. Supreme Court building opposite the United States Capitol, a major extension of the U.S. Government Printing Office building on North Capitol Street, and significant widening of B Street NW on the north side of the National Mall (eventually renamed Constitution Avenue). However, appropriations were to be made annually, leaving control of the project firmly in Congressional hands. Congress appropriated $50 million ($10 million a year for five years) for construction of these projects in 1927, with half the funds to be spent solely on Federal Triangle. A second appropriation bill provided $25 million for buying up all additional privately held land in Federal Triangle. On June 5, 1926, the Treasury Department, which had been given authority over the implementation of the building program, announced the Federal Triangle projects (among others) which would move forward and their anticipated cost:
A National Archives building, with total cost of land and construction to be $6.9 million ($1 million appropriated in fiscal 1927).
A new Internal Revenue Bureau building, with total cost of land and construction to be $7.95 million ($1.7 million appropriated in fiscal 1927).
A new Department of Commerce building, with total cost of construction to be $10 million ($600,000 appropriated in fiscal 1927).
Treasury officials said the Archives building was their top priority, followed by the Internal Revenue building, two Department of Agriculture projects, and the Commerce building last. At that time, no provision was made to construct a new building for the Department of Justice and no sites were named for construction of the three announced buildings. Preliminary plans for the Commerce building were presented to the Commission on Fine Arts and Public Building Commission in mid-June. On July 7, the Treasury Department and Commission of Fine Arts announced sites and sizes for the three previously announced structures.  The Department of Commerce building would contain 1 million square feet (93,000 square metres) of office space and be sited on the south side of B Street NW (now Constitution Avenue NW) on the National Mall. The Internal Revenue building would contain 650,000 square feet (60,450 square metres) of office space and take up two whole city blocks between 10th and 12th Streets NW and B and C Streets NW (cutting off 11th Street NW). The National Archives would contain 2.3 million square feet (213,900 square metres) of office space, and take up one city block between 12th and 13th Streets NW and B and C Streets NW (cutting off the last block of Ohio Avenue NW). The government owned three of the four plots needed for the Internal Revenue site, but none of the land beneath the proposed Archives building. Purchasing both sites, officials estimated, would cost $700,000 each.  Treasury officials also proposed at this time adding a Justice building on Pennsylvania Avenue between 14th and 15th Streets NW, and a Labor building (facing 15th Street) between 14th and 15th Streets NW and D Street NW and Ohio Avenue NW. Preliminary plans for these buildings were expected to be presented in three months.

The purchase of land delayed the construction program considerably over the next several years. Center Market, designed by architect Adolf Cluss and built in 1872, was the largest of the District of Columbia's markets, serving tens of thousands of people a day at a time when general stores and greengrocers were uncommon in the city. It was also a hub for transportation in the District of Columbia, as the city's trolley lines converged there. At the time it was built, it was the largest food market in the United States—with space for more than a thousand vendors, the city's first cold-storage vaults, its own ice storage facility, and its own artesian well. Center Market, however, occupied two blocks between 7th and 9th Streets NW on the north side of B Street NW. As early as August 1926, planners recognized that relocating Center Market and purchasing land from owners eagerly seeking inflated prices from the federal government would delay the Federal Triangle project significantly. Early negotiations with private landowners in the area collapsed early on when owners demanded exorbitant prices for their properties, and the city and federal government began condemnation proceedings in late August 1926 against owners on B Street NW between 10th and 13th Streets. Federal legislation authorizing expanded, faster condemnation powers for the Federal Triangle areas was sought in November 1926, and passed a month later. Condemnation (under the old eminent domain law) of the final block necessary for the Internal Revenue building began in January 1927. The Commission of Fine Arts placed a ban on all non-federal construction in the area in February 1927. The relocation of Center Market began in July 1927. The final lot for the Internal Revenue site was not condemned and purchased until October 1927. Negotiations for the privately owned land at the Archives site began in late November 1927. Funds were furnished in February 1928 to buy the Southern Railway building at the southwest corner of 13th Street NW and Pennsvylania Avenue NW, which already housed a number of federal agencies (it was purchased in 1929). After six months, D.C. city officials finally began to consider a new location for Center Market. The new 1926 federal condemnation law was first used in October 1929 to condemn a set of parcels on the south side of D Street NW between 13th and 13½ Streets NW. A second set of parcels (Pennsylvania Avenue NW and B, 12th, and 13th Streets NW) was condemned under the new law in December 1930. The first land for the National Archives (later the Justice Department) building site was not acquired until July 1930 even though the site had been selected for development in November 1926. Center Market was not relocated until early 1931, more than four years after the process began. Additional land for the Justice and Post Office buildings was condemned in March and December 1931. Another major effort had to be made to condemn and remove railroad tracks from Federal Triangle, which had converged on the Center Market site.  Although the Treasury Department had ordered the tracks lifted by April 1, 1931, this effort did not begin in earnest until early 1931. Negotiations over the price of the land and equipment broke down in February 1931, and the tracks had still not been removed by January 1932. Delay occurred in obtaining the Post Office land as well. Several parcels of land were not condemned until July 1, 1931—a single day before demolition on adjacent parcels of land began. The land for the Apex Building site was finally obtained through condemnation in July 1931.

The initial Federal Triangle building plan was significantly revised by the Public Buildings Commission in November 1926. President Calvin Coolidge refused in September to permit the Commerce building to be placed on the Mall. A few weeks later, the Commission of Fine Arts decided that the Commerce building should be relocated to 14th and 15th Streets NW, extending from D Street NW to B Street NW (cutting off Ohio Avenue NW and C Street NW). The National Capital Parks and Planning Commission established a committee (composed of William Adams Delano, Milton Bennett Medary, and Frederick Law Olmsted Jr.) to study the street plan in the Federal Triangle area and recommend appropriate closures or alterations (if any). While the Public Buildings Commission studied the Commerce site (and even considered halving the size of the building so that two structures could be built along 15th Street), plans for the Archives building were approved and a contract signed for razing of the Internal Revenue site. After these deliberations, the Public Buildings Commission announced on November 17, 1926, that several new buildings would be added and new sites for proposed buildings announced, including:
A new Department of Justice building, to be located between Pennsylvania Avenue NW and D Street NW, and 14th and 15th Streets NW.
A new ""General Supply"" building, to be located between 14th and 13th Streets NW between D and C Streets NW.
A new Independent Offices building, to be located between 12th and 13th Streets NW and B and C Streets NW (cutting off the last block of Ohio Avenue NW; this was the original proposed site of the National Archives in June 1926).
A new Department of Labor building, to be located between 13th and 14th Streets NW and B and C Streets NW.
A new General Accounting Office building, to be located between 9th and 10th Streets NW and B and C Streets NW.
Moving the Department of Commerce site from the National Mall to between 14th and 15th Streets NW between C and B Streets NW.
Moving the National Archives site northward to between 12th and 13th Streets NW and Pennsylvania Avenue NW and C Streets NW (cutting off D Street NW).
Retaining the previously announced site of the Internal Revenue building.
The Public Buildings Commission also announced it would build an 1,800-car parking lot next to the Department of Commerce building, and would proceed with construction of the Commerce and Archives first (as they were the top priority). Three months later, the estimates for construction of the Commerce building was increased to $16 million from $10 million and for the Internal Revenue building to $10.5 million from $2.5 million. Work on the Commerce building site was expected to begin by March 31, 1927. Government officials, other experts, and the press believed that the demolition of the District Building and Old Post Office Pavilion and the closure of many streets in the area would occur.

1927

Work on all buildings was postponed in May 1927. On May 6, an ad hoc committee composed of Olmsted; Medary; Charles Moore, chair of the Commission on Fine Arts; and Louis E. Simon, Supervising Architect of the U.S. Treasury, recommended relocating the Justice building from 15th Street NW to a lot further east so that traffic congestion at 15th and Pennsylvania might be alleviated. This ad hoc committee met again three days later to not only consider the Justice building relocation but also to consider a plan to create a single building ringing Federal Triangle rather than six to eight individual structures. The Public Buildings Commission considered the same plan on May 16. The Commission on Fine Arts approved relocating the Justice building the following day. However, disagreements among the three planning bodies proved so fundamental that a new Board of Architectural Consultants was created on May 19, 1927, to advise the groups on the development of Federal Triangle. The Board consisted of the Supervising Architect of the U.S. Treasury (Louis E. Simon) and six private architects, including Louis Ayres, Edward H. Bennett, Arthur Brown, Jr., William Adams Delano, Milton Bennett Medary, and John Russell Pope. The Board of Architectural Consultants first met on May 23, at which time it considered a plan to create a single building ringing Federal Triangle rather than six to eight individual structures. As the Board of Architectural Consultants began its deliberations, the Commission on Fine Arts approved a plan to locate the Justice building on the north side of B Street NW between 7th and 9th Streets NW (where Center Market stood). About two weeks later, the Public Buildings Commission approved the single structure plan. This plan envisioned a central plaza (defined by 13th, 14th, B, and D Streets NW) surrounded by a traffic circle, with the buildings lining the exterior of the traffic circle. Few streets would be closed; rather, arches would connect each building to its neighbors (with only 12th Street NW remaining unbridged).

The final design of Federal Triangle began to come together in June 1927. The Board of Architectural Consultants approved the construction of the Commerce and Internal Revenue structures as stand-alone buildings on the sites last proposed in late June. In July, the Board proposed eight buildings, sited as follows:
Archives (surrounded by Interstate Commerce on the north, east, and south)
Commerce (west side of 15th Street NW between B and D Streets NW)
General Accounting (13th, 14th, B, and C Streets NW)
Independent Offices (6th, 7th, and B Streets NW and Pennsylvania Avenue NW)
Internal Revenue (B, 10th, 12th, and C Streets NW)
Interstate Commerce (9th, 10th, and B Streets NW and Pennsylvania Avenue NW)
Justice (7th, 9th, and B Streets NW and Pennsylvania Avenue NW)
Labor (B, 13th, 14th, and C Streets NW)
The Board did not address the future of the District Building, Old Post Office Pavilion, or Southern Railway Building, but had tentatively agreed to continue with the ""Louvre plan"" of a ring of buildings joined by arches.

The first design contract for any of the buildings in Federal Triangle was statutorily required by Congress in 1926 as part of the Public Buildings Act. A new headquarters for the Department of Commerce had been proposed in 1912 and a contract for the design work awarded to the architectural firm of York and Sawyer. Although this building was never built, Congress honored the contract and named the firm again as the Commerce building's designer. By March 1927, government officials had already decided that the Commerce building should be 1,000 feet (305 metres) long—making it the then-largest building in the District of Columbia.  The May 1927 work moratorium, however, put these plans on hold. In September 1927, the design of the Internal Revenue building was handed over to Louis Simon at the Treasury Department, and the Commission of Fine Arts met to discuss proposed plans for both the Commerce and Internal Revenue buildings. At the same time, the Commission received bids on demolition of existing structures in the Triangle.

After review by the Board of Architectural Consultants, the Public Buildings Commission gave final design approval on November 1, 1927, to the Commerce and Internal Revenue buildings. The previous sizes of both buildings was reaffirmed, as was the ""Louvre plan"" for a unified ring of buildings surrounding a traffic circle and plaza. The Commission on Fine Arts adopted a requirement that the planned Federal Triangle buildings have a ""uniform appearance"" and height (six stories), limiting the Board's deliberations. Secretary Mellon imposed a requirement that all the buildings be built in the Neoclassical architectural style. By mid-December 1927, the design of the Archives building had been approved, and the Board of Architectural Consultants was meeting again to study once more the general layout of the Federal Triangle.

1928
By March 1928, newspapers had reported that the Commerce and Internal Revenue buildings would be constructed first, followed by the Archives, then Justice, and then a newly added Post Office building. Plans continued for the demolition of the District Building and Southern Railway headquarters (although the latter would be the last to be razed, as it would be used as temporary office space for displaced federal workers). Although the Commerce building plans (a -long building with  of office space, the largest office building in the world) had stabilized by March 1928, some designers suggested that both 15th and 14th Streets NW be submerged in tunnels beneath the structure. About the same time, the Internal Revenue building's square footage was reduced by almost a quarter to 500,000 square feet (46,500 square metres). In July, Congress appropriated $210,000 for design work for the Independent Offices, Interstate Commerce, Justice, and Labor buildings, and Secretary Mellon altered the work schedule yet again to focus on these structures. The Board of Architectural Consultants met to consider ways in which the construction program might be sped up, and devised plans to have four approved buildings (Commerce, Internal Revenue, Justice and Labor) completed by 1932. By October 1928, the Board of Architectural Consultants had agreed with prior decisions that no office building should be constructed on the National Mall, and that this space should be reserved for museums.

Plans for the eastern apex of Federal Triangle, however, were complicated by an ongoing effort to create a George Washington Memorial.  A George Washington Memorial Association was organized in 1898 to establish in the District of Columbia a university bearing Washington's name. Efforts to do so were unsuccessful, but in 1904 the Association signed an agreement with D.C.-based Columbian University to change its name to George Washington University and build a large memorial hall on the university's campus. Plans for the memorial hall did not move forward, however, so the Association joined with the Smithsonian Institution to build a similar structure on the former site of the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad's Pennsylvania Station. A design competition was held in 1914, and architects chosen. The cornerstone was laid in 1921, and some of the foundation and a marble stairway built on a plot of land across B Street NW (where the National Gallery of Art sits today) in 1924. In 1929, even as the Federal Triangle project was moving forward, the George Washington Memorial Association was conducting fund-raising for the construction of the building at the proposed National Archives site. Press reports, however, indicated that the building had already been displaced from the Apex building site. The fund-raising effort eventually failed, and the foundation and stairs were razed in 1937 to make way for the National Gallery of Art.

1929–31
Architectural models of the proposed Federal Triangle development were unveiled in late April 1929. Design work on the Independent Offices, Justice, and Labor buildings also began at that time. After these models were unveiled, however, the Board once more made changes to the Federal Triangle construction plan to reflect the March and April changes made by Hoover and Mellon. Now only seven large structures were planned, and assigned to the following Board members for design:
Apex Building (formerly the Independent Offices building, and now assigned to house the United States Coast Guard) - Bennett
Commerce Department building - Ayers (of the firm York and Sawyer)
Internal Revenue Service building - Simon
Justice Department building - Medary
Labor Department/Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) building, and Departmental Auditorium - Brown
National Archives building - Pope
Post Office Department building - Delano

Two major changes to the complex came in early 1930. The Board and other planning groups had long agreed to site the Justice Department building on the block bounded by 7th, 9th, and B Streets NW and Pennsylvania Avenue NW. But this plan changed in March 1930. Architect John Russell Pope made a proposal to have the Justice and Archives switch sites so that the Justice building would have more space. Although the change would entail major design alterations in both buildings, Secretary Mellon favored the idea.  The Commission on Fine Arts approved the plan, and Mellon met with the Board of Architectural Consultants in late March 1930 to discuss the idea. Although this initial meeting left the issue unresolved, the Board later agreed to Mellon's wishes in April and the two buildings switched plots. At the end of April, President Hoover asked Congress to appropriate $10.3 million (the most yet) to build a new Post Office Department building between 12th and 13th Streets NW, from Pennsylvania Avenue NW south to C Street NW.

Parking and traffic issues proved immensely vexing for the planners of Federal Triangle. The original L'Enfant Plan setting out the streets of Washington, D.C., still existed in the Federal Triangle area. Both C Street NW and D Street NW still ran from 15th Street NW to 15th Street NE.  Ohio Avenue NW ran in a northwest–southeast line from the intersection of D and 15th Streets NW to the intersection of B and 12th Streets NW (soon to be renamed as Constitution Avenue NW and 12th Street NW). Louisiana Avenue NW still ran in a southwest–northeast direction from 10th and B Streets NW to 7th and D Streets NW (along what is currently the diagonal portion Indiana Avenue NW). The McMillan Plan was developed before the widespread use of the automobile, and now the Board of Architectural Consultants had to decide how to accommodate the ""horseless carriage"" while also making Federal Triangle pedestrian-friendly. The Board began studying traffic issues in late 1927. A major study of parking needs and solutions was conducted in 1931, and traffic and parking patterns assessed again after the Department of Commerce building opened in early 1932. To achieve some of the traffic and parking goals, the east–west streets and diagonal avenues were eliminated, leaving only the north–south streets through the area, and 12th and 9th Streets NW were submerged in tunnels beneath the National Mall. In the first major change to the Board's ""final"" plans, the Grand Plaza was abandoned in favor of a parking lot. The Board considered a number of other solutions to the need to accommodate the more than 7,500 cars expected to arrive every day (including an underground bus terminal and underground parking garage under the Grand Plaza), but in the end only approved a small number of underground parking spaces beneath the Apex Building.

Design influences

The design of Federal Triangle was significantly influenced by the Louvre-Tuileries Palace complex in France and the concentration of government buildings in Whitehall in the United Kingdom. But planning for the complex was also deeply influenced by the City Beautiful movement and the idea of creating a civic center to achieve efficiency in administration as well as reinforce the public's perception of government as authoritative and permanent. For the architectural style of the buildings, the Board relied heavily on the McMillan Plan's recommendation of the Neoclassical style. Both the Board and Treasury Secretary Andrew W. Mellon rejected the Modern style then heavily in vogue. Rather than a mass of tall, imposing buildings, two unifying open spaces (intended for ceremonial use, and under discussion by the Board at least by March 1928) would be utilized. The first would be a Circular Plaza (inspired by the Place Vendôme) bisected by 12th Street NW, and which would require the demolition of the Old Post Office Pavilion. The second would be a rectangular Grand Plaza on the east side of 14th Street NW between the proposed Department of Commerce building (west side of 14th Street NW) and the proposed Post Office Department building (east side of 13th Street NW). The construction of the Grand Plaza would have required the demolition of the District Building.

The Board received significant input from the Commission of Fine Arts (which strongly advocated implementation of the McMillan Plan), National Capital Parks and Planning Commission, and the Washington Board of Trade. One guiding principle for the project was that office space for at least 25,000 federal workers must be included. Another was that, although the buildings would be modern steel frame structures, they would each be the same height and faced with limestone. The National Capital Parks and Planning Commission had the least influence over the overall design of the project, primarily because it had only recently been formed.

Although the Board unveiled its proposed design for the project in 1929, the design still lacked a unifying architectural look. Subsequently, John Russell Pope was asked in September 1929 to bring a more uniform style to the buildings. Nonetheless, within this more uniform approach, a variety of styles could be used, and were: Italian Renaissance for the Department of Commerce building, Corinthian for the National Archives building, and Ionic for the Post Office Department. Meanwhile, the Board worked with sculptors, painters, and others to design more than 100 statues, fountains, bronze doors, murals, plaques, and panels (both interior and exterior) throughout the complex. Modern architectural styles were not completely ignored in the design effort, however; most of the doors and grillwork throughout the Federal Triangle complex were Art Deco in style.

Construction of original seven buildings

Beginning: Hoover administration

The Treasury Department signed a contract for razing of existing buildings at the Internal Revenue site in October 1926. The size of the Commerce building was set at  long in March 1927, and survey work at the site began on March 31, 1927 (even though final plans for the project were still unclear). Work on all buildings was postponed in May 1927. Work began again in September 1927 when demolition work on the Commerce and Internal Revenue sites began again. Excavation of both sites began on November 21, 1927. Additional demolition contracts were awarded for both sites in April 1928, and foundation work for the Internal Revenue building began in June 1928. Due to the soft nature of the ground, 8,000 pilings were driven into the earth to support the foundation. Work on Internal Revenue's superstructure began on March 8.

The cornerstone of the first building to be constructed, the Internal Revenue building, was laid by Treasury Secretary Andrew W. Mellon on May 25, 1929. While digging its foundation, workers uncovered a dock which was at least 100 years old. Indiana Limestone was used for the facing, and Tennessee marble for the columns. The sites of all the Triangle buildings had been established in their revised positions by May 1929, with two exceptions: The positions of the Justice and Archives buildings remained as originally planned (with Justice in the east), and the apex space remained unallotted. President (and former Commerce Secretary) Herbert Hoover laid the cornerstone of the Commerce building on June 10, 1929, using the same trowel President George Washington had used to lay the cornerstone of the U.S. Capitol. The construction contract for the Commerce building (set at $13.567 million) had been signed in March, and the contract for its limestone facade—according to at least one newspaper account, the largest stone contract in world history—was awarded in April. By then, the cost of the Commerce building had risen to $17.5 million. Due to the formerly marshy condition of the soil and several submerged streams nearby, more than 18,000 pilings had to be set to construct the Commerce building. Water pressure from the submerged Tiber Creek made it too difficult to drive the piles, so a deep-sea diver descended into the underground Tiber Creek and drilled a hole 20 feet (6.1 metres) deep into the earth. A hose was inserted into the hole, and water pumped from the earth until the water table dropped and the driving of the piles could be accomplished. The October 1929 stock market crash and subsequent Great Depression led newly elected President Herbert Hoover to increase spending on existing public works as a means of stimulating the economy. No funds had been authorized yet for the Archives, Independent Offices, Justice, or Labor buildings, and Hoover secured an additional $2.5 million a year for 10 years from Congress for this purpose.<ref>""Archives Building Bill Before House.""

December 29, 1929.</ref> Work on the Justice and Independent Offices/Labor buildings now proceeded.

Treasury officials hoped to have the Post Office building under construction and ground broken for the Justice building by December 1930. But a major design change and funding choices were made in 1930. Pope convinced the Commission on Fine Arts to switch the positions of the Department of Justice and National Archives, giving the Justice building more space. Congress also amended the Public Buildings Act to permit private (not just federally employed) architects to bid on design contracts, and agreed to fund the construction of the Justice, Labor/ICC, National Archives, and Post Office buildings.For a time, the design of the Archives and Post Office buildings included the diversion of cool water from Tiber Creek to cool the buildings. See: ""River Use to Cool Building Weighed."" Washington Post. July 29, 1931; ""Home of Federal Records Will Bring Dignity to Seventh St."" Washington Post. December 22, 1933.

1931 saw much of the Federal Triangle project near completion. In March 1931, Congress appropriated $3 million to begin construction of the Apex Building, the last structure to be funded. Demolition began on the site the following November. The Internal Revenue building was completed and occupied in June.""Internal Revenue Building Finished."" Washington Post. June 1, 1930. It was finished a year ahead of schedule, and contained more than 672,000 square feet (62,500 square meters) of office space (3.4 percent more than originally planned). But work had yet to begin on the Justice, Labor, or Post Office buildings. Work on the ICC building finally began in April 1931 when the two blocks for the site began to be razed, and 13th Street NW was permanently blocked off at that time. The first work on the Post Office site began in July with demolition as well. Demolition of existing structures on the Archives site ended in August 1931, and ground was finally broken on September 5.""Archives Building Site to Be Broken In Ceremony Today."" Washington Post. September 5, 1931. Meanwhile, razing of the ICC/Labor site was also completed by the first of September, and excavation work began shortly thereafter.

In 1932, the Commerce building opened and construction began on three additional buildings at Federal Triangle. The Department of Commerce building opened on January 4, 1932. The finished building had 1,605,066 square feet (148,271.1 square metres) of office space (more than 60 percent larger than originally planned), and its foundation was more than three feet thick in places in order to withstand the hydraulic pressure put on it by the submerged Tiber Creek. Water from the Tiber was utilized as an air conditioning system, to cool the building. July saw the construction contract for the $7.67 million Justice Department building signed. Although some funds for Federal Triangle projects had not been appropriated yet, work still went ahead using funds from other projects which were behind schedule. On September 26, 1932, the 143rd anniversary of the founding of the U.S. Postal Service, President Hoover laid the cornerstone of the Post Office Department building (although the foundation had already been laid, and the steel superstructure of the building was already three stories high).""Capital Post Office Named for Franklin.""

August 28, 1932; ""Hoover to Preside In New Postoffice Corner Stone Rite."" Washington Post. September 26, 1932. Once again, Hoover used the trowel which George Washington had used to lay the Capitol's cornerstone.""Washington's Trowel Is Used; Service Personnel Gets Executive Praise."" Washington Post. September 27, 1932. Congress had appropriated $10.3 million for the new structure, which was designed to accommodate more than 3,000 workers. Its eight stories would be laid on a granite foundation and the sides clad in limestone. On December 1, 1932, the contract for construction of the limestone National Archives building (whose estimated construction cost was $5.284 million) was awarded to the George A. Fuller Company (which had constructed the New York Times Building and the Flatiron Building). Hoover laid two cornerstones on December 15 for the Labor/ICC building, the third building to begin construction that year.""New Labor Building Dedication Is Today."" Washington Post. December 15, 1932. Workers who were Freemasons assisted the President in laying the cornerstones. Hoover personally oversaw the dedication of the cornerstone at the Labor end of the building. His words were broadcast over loudspeaker to the workers at the ICC end of the structure, who placed the ICC cornerstone simultaneously at the President's instruction (becoming the first time in Washington history that a single person dedicated two cornerstones at the same time). William Green, President of the American Federation of Labor, attended the laying of the cornerstone for the Labor building. Once more, Hoover used the trowel used by Washington to lay the cornerstone of the Capitol. Two weeks later, on December 30, the concrete foundation of the Archives building was poured.

Two days before George Washington's birthday, President Hoover laid the cornerstone of the National Archives building on February 20, 1933. The structure's cost was set at $8.75 million. Just three days later, he laid the cornerstone of the Department of Justice building with a trowel made from wood and cooper nails from the USS Constitution.""Hoover Lays Stone of Justice Building."" Washington Post. February 24, 1933. Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes, Associate Justice Harlan Fiske Stone, Associate Justice Owen Roberts, Associate Justice James Clark McReynolds, Solicitor General Thomas D. Thacher, and Attorney General William D. Mitchell all attended the ceremony. Five months later, a small fire at the Post Office construction site was extinguished by a security guard before it could do any damage. Late in 1933, the northern addition to the Internal Revenue building (the land had been condemned in December 1930) began to rise.

Completion: Roosevelt administration
Only one building remained to be constructed under the new administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. By December 1933, the President was preparing his proposal to Congress for full funding of the Apex Building construction project. But the Apex Building itself almost was not built, as Pope and others argued that it tended to hide the planned National Archives building.""Protests on Apex Building Probed."" Washington Post. December 14, 1933; ""Apex Building Site Discussed."" Washington Post. December 16, 1933.""D.C. Planning Before Three Bodies Today."" Washington Post. January 18, 1934. Still others thought the site should be used for the proposed Jefferson Memorial.""Boylan Asks A Memorial On Apex Site."" Washington Post. December 24, 1933. Through Roosevelt's personal intervention, the building was saved—but nearly all its external ornamentation was stripped, and plans for a terraced fountain nearby eliminated (although a small fountain was built in what eventually became known as Patrick Henry Park). Construction of the building was re-approved on January 18, 1934. The building's final cost was estimated at just over $12 million.

In 1934, one building began construction and another finished. The Apex Building site began to be cleared in April. The Post Office building was occupied on May 6, and Postmaster General James Farley dedicated the Post Office Department building on June 11, 1934.""Oratory Stirs Throng at U.S. Building Rites."" Washington Post. June 12, 1934. Its final cost was $10.83 million, about half a million dollars over budget. Construction in the rest of the Triangle, however, seemed stalled.  Although some structures had been razed on the site, no appropriation had been made for the Apex Building. The government had also cleared land northeast of the Internal Revenue building (as planners considered adding yet another building to the Triangle), but Congress was increasingly opposed to demolishing either the Old Post Office or the District Building. City officials considered selling the District Building to the federal government as a means of raising cash to build a new city hall, but federal officials balked at the idea. President Roosevelt dedicated the newly opened Department of Justice building on October 25, 1934.""Roof Finished, Justice Building Dedication Set, Rain or Shine."" Washington Post. September 27, 1934; ""President Attends Dedication of Classic Hall of Justice."" Washington Post. October 26, 1934. Chief Justice Hughes, all the Associate Justices of the Supreme Court, Attorney General Homer Stille Cummings, and a large number of foreign ambassadors also attended the dedication. The $11 million structure had more than 550,000 square feet (51,200 square meters) of office space. By November 1934, the addition to the Internal Revenue building was nearing completion, and government officials were contemplating the razing of the District Building, Old Post Office Pavilion, and Southern Railway Building.

The Labor/ICC and Archives buildings were opened in 1935. Numerous strikes (see below) had delayed the opening of the building for almost a year. In April 1934, Secretary of Labor Frances Perkins asked for additional (if minor) design changes. Pressing needs for office space meant that a portion of the ICC building was occupied before the structure was finished. Minor alterations were made to the Labor building (such as creating a private rather than shared bathroom for the female Secretary) in January 1935. Secretary of Labor Frances Perkins dedicated the two buildings at a ceremony in the Departmental Auditorium on February 26, 1935, attended by AFL President William Green.""Capital Dedicates New Labor Edifice."" New York Times. February 26, 1935. The Labor building's final cost was $4.5 million and the ICC portion of the structure cost $4.45 million. The two buildings were connected by the 2,000-seat Departmental Auditorium (renamed the Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium in 1987).The ICC was not the only agency to take up space in the building.  Due to the proliferation of New Deal government agencies and the lack of office space in the city, the ICC was forced to share office space for several years with the Federal Radio Commission, the Subsistence Homesteads Division of the Department of the Interior, the Tennessee Valley Authority, and the Soil Erosion Service of the Department of the Interior. See: ""I.C.C. to Share Its Building."" Washington Post. May 26, 1934. Meanwhile, construction forged ahead on the Archives building. Already considered too small to hold all the materials in its possession, a proposal had been made to add another story to the building. This proposal was rejected in March 1935. The National Archives building was occupied in November 1935, but had no formal dedication. Although the Archives structure had been one of the top priorities of almost all planners, it was one of the last buildings to be opened. Archives staff began moving into the building in November 1935, and the exhibition rotunda was opened to the public in November 1936. Records were not transferred in large numbers to the building until April 1937.

The Apex Building was the last to be constructed and dedicated. A major impetus for the building's construction came in June 1935, when the Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) headquarters at C Street NW and 21st Street NW was razed to make way for the Federal Reserve Board Building. The FTC petitioned the Commission on Fine Arts to permit it to occupy the Apex Building. Testing for the foundation began in September 1936, and was completed shortly thereafter. With design work long completed and President Roosevelt expressing his wish that the structure be built, a $3.1 million contract for the building was signed on December 29, 1936. Using the George Washington trowel, President Roosevelt laid the cornerstone for the building on July 12, 1937.""FTC Building Dedication Rite Set for Today."" Washington Post. July 12, 1937. The building's $3.665 million cost was paid for out of Public Works Administration funds, and officials estimated it would be ready for occupation by January 1, 1938. Demolition of the old foundation for the unbuilt Washington Memorial occurred in July 1937, and much of the Apex Building's steel superstructure was rising by then as well. The great depth of the building's foundation meant that the crane operator lifting the steel beams into place was out of sight in the basement, and a series of telephone links from observers on the street relayed instructions to him. By December 1937, the building was two months ahead of schedule.

One of the most important aspects of the new building was the group of massive sculptures to be installed on either side of the structure.  A jury of four nationally known sculptors (Paul Manship, Adolph Alexander Weinman, Lee Lawrie, and William E. Parsons) selected the artist in January 1938.""Notables Inspect Sculptured Models Offered In Competition for Apex Building Adornment.""

The winner was Michael Lantz, an award-winning instructor in sculpting then employed by the Works Progress Administration.""PA Teacher Wins Sculpture Award."" New York Times. January 27, 1938. The Apex Building had no dedication. The Commission and staff moved into the 125,000 square foot (11,625 square metres) building on April 21, 1938.Bailey, Judith and Hamill, James.

Artwork, exterior details, landscaping, and other finishing touches on the construction of Federal Triangle occupied the period from 1938 to 1947. Landscaping issues of the Grand Plaza and Circular Plaza were considered in January 1934. To protect the Federal Triangle from flooding by the Potomac River (as had happened in 1871), the north and west grounds of the Washington Monument were raised in the summer of 1938 by about six feet (two metres) in order to form a dike against any future floodwaters. The final art installation in the complex was the Oscar Straus Memorial Fountain, designs for which were first considered in December 1933. Plans for the memorial were brought before President Roosevelt for his approval the same month. Discussion continued into 1934. The Federal Triangle project was considered complete with the installation of the Straus Memorial in 1947.

But the Great Plaza was never built. Instead, the area was turned into a parking lot.

Federal Triangle and the Bonus Army
In June 1932, thousands of homeless World War I veterans, their families, and their supporters occupied the recently condemned assemblage of buildings at the Federal Triangle site as part of the Bonus March on the capital to win better veterans' benefits.The main Bonus Army camp was actually across the 11th Street Bridges in the Anacostia neighborhood of D.C., more than three miles away.

On July 28, 1932, President Hoover ordered General Douglas MacArthur to remove the ""Bonus Army"" from the site. At 4:45 p.m., MacArthur led 1,200 infantry, 1,200 cavalry, and six battle tanks (commanded by Major George S. Patton) to Federal Triangle to remove the Bonus Army. More than 20,000 civil service workers (leaving their offices for the day) watched as the U.S. Army attacked its own veterans. Patton personally led a cavalry charge (with sabers drawn) into the mass of homeless people, and several hundred rounds of vomit gas were launched at the marchers. A Bonus marcher was killed on the site of the Apex Building. The Federal Triangle site was cleared and these members of the Bonus Army marched to Anacostia—where, at 10:14 p.m., MacArthur led a second attack on the 43,000 protesters and burned their camp to the ground.

Labor issues during 1930s construction

Labor-management troubles occurred throughout construction of the initial seven buildings in the Federal Triangle complex in the 1920s and 1930s. Much of Washington, D.C.'s, construction workforce was unionized many years before the project began. All the building contractors employed by the federal government signed three-year contracts with the major labor unions representing their workers in September 1929, in the hope that this would eliminate any disruptions during the building program. But this hope proved false.

The first problem occurred in July 1930, when the lathers union struck to win a $2 per day (16.7 percent) pay increase, halting work for a short period of time on the Archives, Interstate Commerce, Justice, Labor, and Post Office sites. A second strike occurred in late summer 1931 over a new federal wage law. The Davis-Bacon Act was passed by Congress and signed into law by President Hoover on March 3, 1931. On August 4, 1931, painters working on the Internal Revenue building struck, arguing that out-of-town workers were being imported into the city to work on the building and being paid $5-to-$7 a day rather than the prevailing local wage rate of $11 a day. Both the Treasury and Labor Departments stepped in to arbitrate the strike. The dispute was settled a few days later when the Labor Department found that the contractor had paid the correct wages, and that no workers were being paid overtime.During the Great Depression, the federal government and labor unions discouraged businesses from asking existing employees to work overtime.  With unemployment skyrocketing, businesses instead were encouraged to hire temporary workers, so that more people might work and thus feed and shelter themselves (as well as stay off public assistance rolls). See: Schlesinger, Arthur M. The Age of Roosevelt: The Crisis of the Old Order, 1919–1933. Paperback ed. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Co., 1957. 

The construction project's labor troubles worsened in 1933. With the Depression deepening, contractors were pressing for a 27.3 percent wage cut with their unions, particularly the carpenters' union. On January 6, 1933, a fire swept through the upper floors of the unfinished ICC building. The fire was ruled arson and a ""disgruntled carpenter"" was suspected. Two weeks later, the operating engineers and steamfitters unions engaged in a jurisdictional strike against one another, stopping work at the Post Office construction site, but the AFL intervened and arbitrated a solution to the dispute. The earlier wage dispute, however, had not been resolved, and by February a general strike among all unionized workers at the Federal Triangle complex seemed likely. Employers said they would fire all unionized workers if a strike occurred and replace them with strikebreakers. The two sides agreed to let the Treasury Department arbitrate their dispute, and on February 13 the government ruled in favor of the unions—averting a job action. The employers went to court, and in April 1933 the carpenters agreed to the 27.3 percent wage cut.

The second major wage dispute of 1933 broke out in May. On May 26, more than 500 members of the plasterers' union struck to prevent a $2 (14.3 percent) pay cut, halting all work on the seven active Federal Triangle constructions sites. The employers and the American Institute of Architects both argued that the higher wage would inhibit economic recovery in the construction industry. To prove their point, the employers locked out the workers; the strike collapsed, and plasterers went back to work on July 22.

August 1933 saw the eruption of a series of labor-management disputes and inter-union squabbles that put construction of the Federal Triangle complex on hold for several months. The first event was when the Journeyman Stonecutters Association of North America walked out on a jurisdictional strike against the iron workers' union on August 21, idling 225 men working on the Post Office building. The dispute was over which union would ride with crane operators to coordinate the movement of loads with workers on the ground. The strike lasted at least until September 7, with both sides seeking a decision from the American Federation of Labor. Then on September 1, 75 carpenters walked off the job in a jurisdictional dispute with the iron worker's union. This dispute, which occurred at the Labor/ICC building, was over which workers would be permitted to install decorative enclosures around radiators. With work on the Labor/ICC buildings already two months behind schedule due to the earlier labor disputes, the employers threatened to stop all work if the carpenters' union struck and throw another 1,000 men out of work. The employers shut down on September 15. Twenty security guards were stationed at the Labor/ICC building to prevent vandalism. On September 18, a third jurisdictional strike occurred when the boilermakers' union walked off the job at the Federal Triangle central heating plant to protest the use of iron workers in the erection of smokestacks for the facility. Construction of the smokestacks continued, but construction of the boilers was halted. A fourth jurisdictional strike erupted on September 20, when 80 members of the bricklayers' union walked off the job at the heating plant to protest the use of laborers to caulk windows, stone, and roof tiles. Although the bricklayers remained on the job for the moment, government officials feared that sympathy strikes would occur, stopping work at all seven construction sites.""U.S. Officials Fearing Spread Of Labor Row."" Washington Post. September 24, 1933. The carpenters rejected a call for the government to arbitrate the strike, and the employers asked for Senator Robert F. Wagner (a proponent of organized labor) to help settle the disputes. On September 26, the AFL ruled that the smokestack work properly belonged to the iron workers, and ordered the boilermakers back to work. But the carpenters' union initiated a new protest, arguing that the installation of pulley linings in elevators belonged to them and not to the elevator constructors' union. And the Washington Building and Construction Trades Council threatened to call a general strike of all construction workers if the bricklayers were not pulled off the job installing boiler insulation and the asbestos workers' union allowed to do the job instead. Senator Wagner also said on Sept. 28 that he believed a resolution to the carpenters/iron workers dispute (which had led to the layoff of 1,000 workers at the Labor/ICC building) could be reached. But the boilermakers did not return to work, leaving 450 workers laid off. Meanwhile, government officials said that the caulking, insulation, and pulley work disputes would be resolved soon, and would not in any case cause further disruptions at construction sites. Another major work disruption threatened the Federal Triangle complex when the iron workers' union demanded that contractors initiate two four-hour shifts per day rather than one eight-hour shift per day in order to spread work among more men. When contractors balked, the union struck at the Post Office and Justice building sites. That strike lasted two days before about half of the employers capitulated. But it continued for the remaining employers at the Justice and Post Office buildings. Finally, on October 11, 1933, frustrated and angry Labor Department officials said that unless the jurisdictional disputes were ended quickly, the government would seek authorization from Congress in January to force the unions back to work and resolve the disputes itself. The threat worked:  On October 13, all parties to all jurisdictional disputes agreed to return to work while continuing to seek resolution to their problems via other channels. Federal officials excoriated the carpenters' union for holding up a $40,000-a-week payroll for four weeks over an $800 job. Eleven days later, the iron workers' union agreed to return to the eight-hour shift.

The labor peace was short-lived. Four unions refused to do work on the Post Office conveyor belt system in mid-November, and the dispute over elevators spread to the Labor/ICC building in February 1934 (delaying the building's opening indefinitely). On February 14, 1934, 225 carpenters engaged in a jurisdictional strike against the cement finishers' union at the Labor/ICC building over the installation of tile flooring. The dispute was elevated to AFL President William Green, Green awarded the job to the cement finishers on March 17. But just three weeks later, the plasterers' union led a jurisdictional strike against the stonecutters' union at the Labor/ICC building because the stonecutters were installing acoustical marble columns. Contractors, angry at the repeated inter-union squabbles, announced they would no longer employ reduced-hour shifts or give pay raises. The carpenters' union called for a general strike of all unions at the Labor/ICC building on May 25, a strike which spread to the city's ice cream plants. That secondary strike ended June 4. But the general construction strike began to spread to other federal projects throughout the city, leading to an increasing number of calls for the strike to be settled by arbitration. As the work stoppage spread, the carpenters' union's contract with the construction companies expired on May 30. The employers declared on June 12 that they would no longer adhere to any closed shop agreements with the carpenters, and instead would impose the open shop and employ any carpenter (union or non-union) in order to finish the work on existing construction projects. The construction unions declared they would pull every worker off every job if non-union construction laborers were hired, and the D.C Metropolitan Police Department made preparations to patrol streets and job sites to prevent any violence from erupting. Non-union workers were hired, and the carpenters' union struck all job sites throughout the city amidst fears that the carpenters might strike all federal construction projects nationwide. Three union members were injured on June 13 as picketers clashed with security guards hired by the employers. But the strike did not spread to the other unions, and the Washington Building and Construction Trades Council and D.C. Commissioner George E. Allen attempted to mediate an end to the strike. The carpenters rejected the arbitration attempt, and bands of roving picketers moving among construction sites led to traffic tie-ups, frightened citizens, and rumors of violence. The ""open shop strike"" ended on June 20, 1934, when the carpenters agreed to a new contract providing for a five-day, 40-hour work week and $1.25 an hour in pay. But no agreement was made regarding the open shop. The plasterers' union ended their strike in June 1934, and went to local district court to resolve the jurisdictional dispute.

The final labor dispute to affect the Federal Triangle complex construction was a jurisdictional strike over the installation of library shelving at the National Archives building in November 1935.

Federal Triangle's first half-century
The continuing existence of the District Building, Old Post Office Pavilion, and Southern Railway building as well as parking issues became points of contention during Federal Triangle's first 50 years. District of Columbia officials said in 1958 that they were willing to have the District Building torn down and Federal Triangle ""finished"" (if the city was properly compensated), but a lack of federal funds defeated the move. In 1995, the D.C. and federal governments signed an agreement in which the federal government would construct a new top floor and renovate the building (at a cost of $47 million) in return for a 20-year lease on 130,000 square feet (12,090 square metres) of space in the structure. Plans were developed in 1970 to demolish most of the Old Post Office Pavilion (leaving only the bell tower). But opposition to the plan emerged, and the following year plans were made to restore the building instead. In 1973, the General Services Administration (GSA) developed a plan save the Old Post Office Pavilion, and the National Capitol Planning Commission agreed to the project. An $18 million renovation began in 1977. The renovation was completed in 1983 to highly positive reviews. In the late 1980s, plans were laid to double the size of the Old Post Office Pavilion's retail space to 75,000 square feet (6,975 square metres) in order to attract more shoppers to the building. Utilizing the provisions of the Public Buildings Cooperative Use Act of 1976, the retail space expansion was financed and completed in 1992. Despite the federal government's intention to demolish the Southern Railway Building and construct a federal office building on the site to complete the Federal Triangle complex, the building stood until 1971. It was demolished in that year, and turned into a parking lot.

As many critics had anticipated during Federal Triangle's construction in the 1930s, parking issues grew much worse due to the development's existence. In the late 1950s, a proposal was made to build a commuter and long-distance bus terminal at Federal Triangle as well as a large office building on the space of the parking lot, but the $60 million it would take to build the terminal was never provided. The parking issue became so vexing that the Eisenhower administration ordered its own parking study in 1959. There were several attempts to remove the parking lot in the interior of Federal Triangle and build the long-planned Great Plaza. The first such move came in 1955, when the Commission of Fine Arts asked the federal government to build the plaza, but nothing came of the proposal. A second effort was made in 1972, with the goal of building the Great Plaza in time for the national bicentennial in 1976, but the required $36.7 million in federal funds were not forthcoming. The parking lot was leased to a private company in 1979.

Several other outstanding issues regarding Federal Triangle's development were also raised, and occasionally resolved, in the next half-century. The closure and elimination of Ohio and Louisiana Avenues NW led each state's representatives to seek to rename other streets in the District of Columbia after those states. Ohio Drive NW came into existence in 1949, after Congress passed legislation authorizing the name change of the drive along the Tidal Basin. Another issue remaining from Federal Triangle's development regarded the condemnation of railway tracks in the area.  The Mount Vernon, Alexandria and Washington Railway argued that it had not been properly compensated for the loss of its tracks in the area, and in 1943 sought federal relief.

Some improvements were made to Federal Triangle, however.  In 1952, the Andrew W. Mellon Memorial Fountain was dedicated  within the eastern tip of the Triangle. A new cooling plant was built in 1960. Beginning in 1970, all the buildings were floodlit at night in order to reduce the level of crime in the area.

In 1972, the Federal Triangle Washington Metro station was approved at Federal Triangle, and the station on Metro's Blue and Orange lines opened on July 1, 1977. Major heating, cooling, and electrical upgrades were made to the Archives, ICC, and Labor buildings and the Departmental Auditorium in 1984.

After the terrorist bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City on April 19, 1995 (which killed 168 people), security at Federal Triangle was tightened measurably and many of the pedestrian areas and buildings restricted to federal employees or those with official business. A major renovation for the Labor, ICC, and Post Office buildings was conducted in 1998.

Ronald Reagan Building construction

Context
Even as parking and traffic issues continued to cause controversy at Federal Triangle in the 1960s and 1970s, efforts were under way to remove the parking lot and ""finish"" Federal Triangle by building a large office building on the site.  The first effort came in 1972, when the Nixon administration proposed building a $126 million office building on the lot in time for the national bicentennial in 1976. But this proposal was never seriously contemplated or funded. One outcome of the Nixon proposal, however, was ""the Weese Plan."" The Nixon administration commissioned the architecture planning firm of Harry Weese & Associates to come up with a master plan for the continued development of Federal Triangle. The Master Plan (which became known as ""the Weese Plan"") did not only propose a massive new federal office building on the parking lots of the Triangle.  It also proposed a new series of pedestrian paths throughout the complex, titled ""Federal Walk."" Federal Walk would not only be a network of sidewalks designed to showcase the architecture of Federal Triangle; it also included destinations such as spots for tourists to wait for tours of the interiors of each building, outdoor art, places for rest and contemplation, and even cafes and restaurants. Federal Walk was gradually implemented in piecemeal fashion over the next 15 years, although it still remained incomplete as of 1997. GSA held a competition in 1982 to select a design for a 10-story office building to replace the parking lot, but planning bodies refused to approve the plan.

Plans for construction of an office building on the Federal Triangle parking lot site found support in 1986. The Federal City Council, a private civic organization which had been promoting the construction of a $200 million international trade center in the District of Columbia, advocated construction of its proposed building at Federal Triangle. Reagan administration officials favored the plan, and in October 1986 the proposal received the backing of the General Services Administration. The idea received support from Democrats in Congress as well, especially from Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a former Kennedy administration aide who had long championed completion of the Federal Triangle. There was some opposition to the idea from planning officials and others, who were dismayed at the loss of parking in the downtown area and who feared that the trade center's proposed 1,300 to 2,600 underground parking slots would not be built due to poor soil conditions. A bill was passed (almost unanimously) by Congress on August 7, 1987, to provide $362 million for the construction of an ""International Cultural and Trade Center"" on the parking lot at Federal Triangle. The plan was to provide office space for both the Justice and State departments. The legislation also provided that although the U.S. government would finance the building, a private developer would construct it. The federal government would lease space from the private developer for 30 years, after which ownership of the building would revert to the government. The bill also required the building to be financially self-supporting within two years of its completion. The rental prices throughout the lease's term would remain stable. It was only the fifth time the government had signed a ""lease-to-own"" agreement. With 1.4 million square feet (130,200 square metres) of office space and 500,000 square feet (46,500 square metres) of space for trade center activities, the planned trade center would be larger than any other federally owned building except for The Pentagon. The bill also required that the trade center be ""designed in harmony with historical and government buildings in the vicinity, ... reflect the symbolic importance and historic character of Pennsylvania Avenue and the Nation's Capital, and ... represent the dignity and stability of the Federal Government."" A nine-member panel was established to approve any plans, and included the Secretaries of State, Agriculture, and Commerce; the Mayor of the District of Columbia; and five members of the public. The building was expected to be completed in 1992. President Ronald Reagan signed the Federal Triangle Development Act into law on August 22, 1987.

Design and construction

Preliminary design specifications required that the final building be no taller than the existing Federal Triangle structures, be constructed of similar materials, emphasize pedestrian traffic, and have a ""sympathetic"" architectural style. An architectural model by the firms of Notter Finegold & Alexander, Mariani & Associates, and Bryant & Bryant depicted a building with a long, uninterrupted facade along 14th Street NW and two colonnaded hemicycles on the east side (matching the Post Office Department building's hemicycle). The preliminary design specs were criticized for not more clearly specifying the architectural style, for bringing another 10,000 new workers to Federal Triangle each day, and for reducing the required number of parking spaces by 30 percent to just 1,300. The five public members of the design committee were named on April 6, 1988, and were former Senator Charles H. Percy, chair; Harry McPherson, president of the Federal City Council; Donald A. Brown, chair of the Federal City Council's International Center Task Force; Michael R. Garder, a member of the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation; and Judah C. Sommer, a local attorney. Groundbreaking on the now-$350 million building was scheduled for 1989, and completion in 1993. Disagreements broke out in mid-1988 over which federal agencies should take up residence in the structure, and whether they should be trade- or foreign-policy related. Seven designs were submitted in June 1989, each incorporating a base-middle-crown structure and enclosed in traditional materials (limestone facade, vertical glass windows, terra-cotta roof tiles). Each design incorporated a new home for the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars (a Smithsonian Institution entity), an outdoor memorial to President Woodrow Wilson, and exhibition and retail space.

Construction began in mid-1989. Contractors estimated the cost of the building at between $550 million and $800 million, far higher than the anticipated $350 million original price tag. The design committee picked the $738.3 million design submitted by Pei Cobb Freed & Partners in October 1989.Wheeler, Linda. ""Federal Triangle Developer Picked."" Washington Post. October 19, 1989. A consortium led by New York developer William Zeckendorf, Jr. was chosen to build and operate the building and lease it to the government. One of the firms which had lost this contract subsequently challenged the bidding process.

Cancellation, completion, and opening
Significant cost increases led to the project being mothballed by the George H. W. Bush administration. The General Services Administration refused to sign the draft lease, arguing that the building's rental costs were too high and would cost (rather than save) the government $18 million to $24 million a year. Although Pei Cobb Freed agreed to investigate design changes to make the project less costly, at least one member of Congress declared the project dead. In September 1990, the architectural team made changes which cut $82 million from the cost of the building (including the elimination of two theaters, scaling down the reception hall, using plaster rather than stone, substituting aluminum for bronze in the trim, and reducing the size of interior doors), reducing the price tag to $656 million. Delta Partnership, a development consortium led by New York developer William Zeckendorf, Jr., was chosen to operate the building and lease it to the government. Another design change came in January 1991, when the number of parking spaces rose by 12.6 percent to 2,500 spaces. But the changes did not resolve the controversies enveloping the project. Design committee member Donald A. Brown quit the committee in late 1991, complaining that the Bush administration was meddling in the project's design. Two days later, Eleanor Holmes Norton, D.C.'s delegate to Congress, repeated these charges. On January 19, 1992, even as the foundation for the trade center was being dug, the GSA said the building would not achieve financial self-sufficiency. A separate report commissioned by the Bush administration reached similar conclusions. On January 25, 1992, the Bush administration cancelled the international trade center construction project. Days later, a United States district court ruled that Delta Partnership had been chosen in violation of federal contracting guidelines, although the court also refused to overturn the award after finding no bias in the award process. Construction experts decried the decision, saying that the building's costs could balloon to more than $1.2 billion if construction were resumed at a later time.

The decision to cancel the building was reversed on December 2, 1993, by the Clinton administration. Although the building was originally designed to be a major tourist destination and provide a boost to economic development in the downtown area, the building was repurposed to be a simple office building. Rather than a mix of federal and private renters, federal agencies were now scheduled to occupy 80 percent of the office space. By January 1995, the structure was two years behind schedule. By September 1995, a tentative occupancy date of December 1996 had been set. The building was named for former President Ronald Reagan in October 1995. There were still occasional design glitches.  For example, the GSA approved two major sculptures for the Woodrow Wilson Plaza in 1994, abruptly ordered a halt to work on the sculptures in June 1996, and then ordered work to proceed again in July 1996. Construction slipped further, and by January 1997 occupancy was scheduled for the following summer. Construction continued to fall behind schedule, with completion not expected until summer 1998. Nonetheless, federal officials planned to move more than 480 Environmental Protection Agency employees into the building in July 1997.Barr, Stephen. ""Grand Tour of Reagan Building Reinforces Facility's Grand Scale."" Washington Post. June 6, 1997. By this time, security concerns had led to several additional design changes (including a reduction in the number of parking spaces to just 1,900), and the cost of the structure had risen to $738 million.

The Ronald Reagan Building opened on May 5, 1998. President Bill Clinton and former First Lady Nancy Reagan dedicated the building. Three large pieces of artwork were included in the building. The first, by sculptor and D.C. native Stephen Robin, is a gigantic rose with stem and a lily, both made out of cast aluminum and lying on stone pedestals. The second, by African American D.C. native Martin Puryear, is a Minimalist tower of brown welded metal titled ""Bearing Witness"" which stands in Woodrow Wilson Plaza. The third, located inside the building's atrium, is a multi-story neon installation by Keith Sonnier titled ""Route Zenith."" The structure's final cost was $818 million.

Critical assessment
""Federal Triangle was the most important government construction project of the 1930s in Washington."" It was the largest construction project in the United States in the 1930s; only the construction of Rockefeller Center in New York City came close. It ""remains one of the most important design and construction projects"" in American history.

The original seven buildings won critical praise for their beauty from the news media when they first opened. The Washington Post said the Internal Revenue building was ""a credit to any city"" and declared the ""marble work to be among the most beautiful in the United States."" At its dedication, The New York Times called the Department of Justice building ""one of the most beautiful public buildings in the world"". But praise was most heavily lavished on the Commerce building. It was not only the largest office building in the world, but the ""greatest of office buildings"" and one which represented the aspirations of the nation. It had ""dignity without severity"", one report said, and was ""a magnificent architectural end"". It had the ""world's most extensive and impressive applications of bronze"", ""embellished with a wealth of detail, delicately modeled, carefully tooled, finely chased and exactingly finished."" Even the interior decorating scheme was highly noted for its ""fine architectural effect"".

But younger architects in the 1930s criticized the style and size of the buildings at Federal Triangle for being ""elitist, pretentious, and anachronistic"". Architecture critic William Harlan Hale strongly criticized the Neoclassical style for being unimaginative and anti-democratic:  ""New Deal indeed! What was there new, or modern, or imaginative, or efficient, or economical in trying to give modern Washington the character of Imperial Rome? What was there either aesthetic or intelligent in cloaking the offices of a modern democracy as the temple of a classic tyrant, the gallery of a Renaissance prince, or the palace of a French monarch? ...we have learned quite a lot about the principles of modern architecture, just as we have learned a lot about some other things; and today, after so short a time, it looks pretty much like a relic out of the dim past."" By the 1940s, some critics said the buildings were too reminiscent of Nazi and Soviet architecture.

Initial assessments of the Ronald Reagan Building's design were overwhelmingly positive.  Washington Post critic Benjamin Forgey highly praised the Pei Cobb Freed design when it was first made public. Forgey found the final building even more praiseworthy, finding it full of ""character and extraordinary potential,"" ""brilliant,"" ""vital,"" ""welcoming,"" ""clever"" and ""dynamic."" Forgey particularly praised the bold stroke of the building's diagonal structure (which extends from the rotunda at the north end of Woodrow Wilson Plaza to the juncture of 13th Street NW and Pennsylvania Avenue NW) and the conical atrium on the building's east side. Federal employees working in the building gave it ""rave reviews"" and at its dedication was one of the most sought-after places to work in the city. But six months later, another Washington Post'' reporter declared the Ronald Reagan building ""much too large,"" ""confusing"" to get around in, ""awkwardly configured,"" and with ""dismal views"". The facade, the critic felt, was ""relentlessly austere"" and represented ""a lost opportunity to lighten the Federal Triangle's imperial, ponderous architectural spirit.""

Current buildings

As of 2009, the Federal Triangle development contained two existing buildings and eight buildings built specifically for the development. The structures include:
Apex Building (which houses the Federal Trade Commission)
William Jefferson Clinton Federal Building (originally the Post Office Department Building, but renamed in 1982 for Ariel Rios and renamed again for Bill Clinton in 2013, houses the Environmental Protection Agency)
Department of Labor / Interstate Commerce Commission building, which now houses the Environmental Protection Agency; (originally the connecting Departmental Auditorium was renamed the Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium in 1987)
Herbert C. Hoover Building (Department of Commerce headquarters; it also houses the White House Visitor Center, and formerly the National Aquarium)
Internal Revenue Service Building
John A. Wilson Building (houses the offices and chambers of the Council, and the Mayor of the District of Columbia)
National Archives Building
Old Post Office Pavilion
Robert F. Kennedy Department of Justice Building (Department of Justice headquarters)
Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center (which houses both private-sector and government offices, including the United States Agency for International Development and U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency)
These buildings are contributing structures to the Pennsylvania Avenue National Historic Site.

6832,"['all them have I did , was thought first my Damp Rising of scripts the publish to decided I When "" : writes Chappell Eric , introduction his In ?']","Rising Damp is a British sitcom, written by Eric Chappell and produced by Yorkshire Television for ITV, which was originally broadcast from 2 September 1974 until 9 May 1978. Chappell adapted the story from his 1973 stage play The Banana Box. The programme ran for four series and a spin-off feature film of the same name was released in 1980. The series won the 1978 BAFTA for Best Situation Comedy. Rising Damp was the highest-ranking ITV sitcom in the BBC's 100 Best Sitcoms poll of 2004, coming in 27th overall.

Premise
Rising Damp starred Leonard Rossiter, Frances de la Tour, Richard Beckinsale and Don Warrington. Rossiter played Rupert Rigsby (originally Rooksby in the stage play), the miserly, seedy, and ludicrously self-regarding landlord of a run-down Victorian townhouse who rents out his shabby bedsits to a variety of tenants. Beckinsale played Alan Moore, a long-haired, naive, good-natured and amiable medical student who occupies the top room. Frances de la Tour played Ruth Jones, a fey, whimsical spinster and college administrator who rents another room, is approaching middle age, and with whom Rigsby is in love.

In the pilot episode, a new tenant arrives. Philip Smith (Don Warrington) is a planning student who claims to be the son of an African Chief. As a black man, he brings out the ill-informed fears and knee-jerk suspicions of Rigsby. However, the landlord quickly accepts his new tenant and henceforth regards him with a wary respect; wary because of Philip's intelligence and smooth manners, and especially because Miss Jones finds herself attracted to the handsome sophisticate.

Of these four principal actors, only Beckinsale was a new recruit – the others had all played their roles in the original stage play. Beckinsale stated that he had originally been approached to appear in the play but was unavailable, so when the part in the television series later came up, he ""jumped at the chance of playing Alan.""

In the first series, there was another tenant Spooner, a professional wrestler, played by Derek Newark. Rigsby gets on his bad side when he and Alan 'borrow' his clothes in the episode 'A Night Out'. Spooner made only two appearances but is mentioned in other episodes in Series 1. Other tenants occasionally move into the house but never became permanent residents, often appearing only in a single episode. Peter Bowles and Peter Jeffrey were among the actors portraying these tenants.

Frances de la Tour temporarily left the series in 1975, after appearing in four episodes of the second series, because of theatre commitments. She was ""replaced"" by Gabrielle Rose for three episodes as new tenant Brenda (she also appeared in la Tour's last episode of 1975 ""Moonlight and Roses""), whilst Henry McGee also stood in for one episode as new tenant and conman Seymour. Frances de la Tour returned for the final two series.

Richard Beckinsale did not appear in the fourth series due to West End theatre commitments. Eric Chappell wrote some lines into the intended first episode ""Fire and Brimstone"" to explain Alan's absence (he had passed his exams to become a doctor) but these were cut when it was decided to broadcast the second episode ""Hello Young Lovers"" as the first episode instead.

Eric Chappell defended Rigsby by saying he ""was not a racist or a bigot, but he was prejudiced and suspicious of strangers. But he accepted Philip and his only concern afterwards was that he didn't get a leg over Miss Jones."" Don Warrington stated: ""There were certain aspects of it that were politically incorrect. On the other, you can see how it held up a mirror to the way we were living.""

Setting
The setting is a rundown Victorian townhouse let out as bedsits in Yorkshire. The exact setting is not explicitly stated although it is implied to be Leeds, through references to Leeds United, Yorkshire Traction, the M62 and the Corn Exchange. The show was recorded entirely before a studio audience at The Leeds Studios of Yorkshire Television in Leeds, West Yorkshire and featured no scenes shot on location.
The film, however, is set in and was filmed in London.

Emphasis on personal failure
The programme depicts closely the failing lives of three of the four main characters. Rigsby is longtime separated from his wife and has since become a seedy, ignorant man who is suspicious of anyone different from himself. Miss Jones is an unhappy spinster who is shown to be desperate for male attention (even willing, in effect, to pay for it). Alan is a medical student with a somewhat plodding intellect, socially inept and who remains a virgin throughout much of the series, despite appearing to be in his mid 20s. Philip, by contrast, is a relatively learned and emotionally intelligent man, who responds to Rigsby's racist ignorance with a kind of ironic complicity, as expressed through lies reminiscing about his African life full of magic, violence and sexual promiscuity, often resulting in Rigsby making a fool of himself through his gullible willingness to believe these stories.

Characters

Rupert Rigsby
The landlord of the house, Rupert Rigsby (Leonard Rossiter) is dour, interfering and tight fisted. He has strong right wing views which are adopted without morals or reason. For example, in the film adaptation he states that hanging should be reinstated but this time in public. Rigsby is an old fashioned colonial type with prejudiced views. He is suspicious of anything beyond his parochial sphere of interest and, most particularly of Philip, who is suave, intelligent, well-spoken – and black.  He is also jealous of Philip because he is enigmatic, adroit, charismatic, and educated, all that Rigsby aspires to be but is not. Rigsby is an ardent patriot, believing himself to be an illegitimate member of the British royal family. He also makes exaggerated and romanticised references to his military service during World War II, frequently referring to 'a bit of trouble with the old shrapnel' and fighting at the Battle of Dunkirk ""I haven't seen fear like that since Dunkirk"". He also refers to seeing action at the Battle of Anzio, and being in Africa during World War Two. Rigsby is also a tremendous snob, obsessed with being perceived as middle class. He often affects an 'old school tie' attitude- another of his fantasies.  While Rigsby tries to flirt with the upper-classes, when they invariably reject him he distances himself, declaring himself to be a self-made man and calling the prospective Conservative candidate an 'upper-class twit' after he refers to Rigbsy's lodging house as the 'unacceptable face of capitalism' and accuses Rigsby of having cheated at billiards in the local conservative club. Rigsby is estranged from his wife, whom he still hates.

Seedy and furtive, Rigsby has poor interpersonal skills. His professed love of Miss Jones is mostly sexual. She rejects him due to him being married, until his marriage ends and Miss Jones accepts his proposal.

As he pries and spies upon his tenants, Rigsby often carries Vienna, his large, fluffy, long-haired, black-and-white tomcat. Rigsby's amiable pet, and confidant, is so named because – as Rigsby tells it – when he goes to put him out on a cold dark night, if there is another set of eyes out there, then it's Good Night, Vienna.

Ruth Jones
""Miss Jones"" (Frances de la Tour) is a middle-aged spinster. A college administrator and well-educated, she is a dauntless romantic: like Rigsby, Miss Jones has pretensions, believing herself to be a sophisticated  aesthete worthy of more satisfaction from her life. The comedy uses pathos to touch upon her frustration and disappointment: in one episode she gives money to a man she has romantic interest in, knowing full well he is conning her, but craving romantic attention to a point where she is willing to effectively pay him for it. The only male attention she has is from Rigsby to which she is intermittently susceptible, though mostly finding his approaches an annoyance, for besides being of sexual interest, Rigsby sees Miss Jones as an upper-middle-class sophisticate and any courtship would be a social as well as sexual conquest. However, Miss Jones openly desires Philip, frequently cooking for him and inviting his company in her room, much to the annoyance and frustration of Rigsby. Unfortunately for her, this interest is not reciprocated although she finds solace in Philip's superior intellect and good manners, and the two appear to be friends.

Alan Moore
Alan Guy Moore (Richard Beckinsale) is a likeable young medical student. Rigsby treats him with mistrust, mainly because of Alan's permissive, left wing views. Alan has little luck with girlfriends, but is content with his life. Alan hails from a middle-class family and appreciates music and arts. Although Alan is academically successful, socially he is somewhat inept, appearing to have few friends outside of the lodging house. Alan occasionally confides his problems in Rigsby, who is always unsympathetic. On one occasion however, Alan is defended by Rigsby, when the incandescent father of Sandra (one of his girlfriends) suspects the two of them have been having sex, Rigsby sends the man out of the house with a 'flea in his ear', defending Alan, apparently because Rigsby was offended the man assumed Rigsby to be Alan's father. Alan is immature and Rigsby does become something of a strange father figure for him.

Alan Moore did not appear in the last series (Series 4) of Rising Damp, Richard Beckinsale being busy with other acting work.

Philip Smith
Philip Smith (Don Warrington) is a second generation British African from Croydon, although for all of the series he claims to be an ""African Prince"" and the son of an African tribal chief. Philip's lies about his 'primitive' background seem most obviously an ironic response to Rigsby's ignorant remarks, and sometimes result in moments when Rigsby's gullibility and desperation lead to his belief in some aspect of Philip's lore: for example, the 'love wood' which fails to excite Miss Jones (in the ""Charisma"" episode, first broadcast 1974). Philip is an intelligent, educated man (more so than the moderately educated Alan and Miss Jones), he is sophisticated and suave; this makes Rigsby suspicious of him, particularly as Miss Jones openly fancies him. Philip does not reciprocate Miss Jones's romantic interest. Warrington told The Telegraph in 2013: ""The difficulty for Rigsby lies in observing somebody who is exactly who he would like to be – apart from the fact that he is black – and that’s very confusing for him.""

Croydon was not revealed to be the true birthplace of Philip until the film version of Rising Damp (1980). Warrington commented in Britain's 50 Best Sitcoms on Channel 4, that this fact was planned to be a plot development in the TV series, but the death of Richard Beckinsale meant this was not possible. In fact in the film when Phillip informed Rigsby of the fact that he was not an African Prince, Rigsby dismissed that cheerfully and said that there could have been royalty somewhere in his heritage.

Episodes

Film

A feature film version was released in 1980, reusing several storylines from the television series. As Richard Beckinsale had died the year before, Christopher Strauli was cast as a new character, art student John. The character of Alan is briefly referenced, as having left. The film's theme song features lyrics by Eric Chappell and was released as a 7"" single. The B-side features comedy dialogue between Rigsby and Miss Jones.

Philip is revealed not to be a chief's son from Africa, but from Croydon, adopting his false persona to start a new life and gain respect. When Rigsby finds out, he tells Philip that he believes he must have some royal ancestry and he does not tell the rest of the characters about his deception. This plotline is from the original stageplay The Banana Box.

Repeats, DVD and scripts
The series has been repeated frequently by ITV in the years since it was originally broadcast. It was repeated on Channel 4 between 1998 and 2004 until the digital channel ITV3 was launched. As of 2021, the series is still repeated on ITV3.

The series aired in the United States and Canada on A&E from 1991-1992. It also aired on the US version of the network prior to that, in the mid-1980s.

The complete series has been released on Region 2 DVD under the Granada Media, Cinema Club and ITV DVD labels; from 2006 to 2008, Acorn Media released it on region 1 DVD in North American markets. On screen episode titles have been added to the Region 2 DVD versions of series 1 & 2. The episode titles on series 3 & 4 are however original. Also, the Region 1 releases are the only ones to retain the Yorkshire Television Colour Production frontcaps/endboards, as well as the ""end of part one"" and ""part two"" ad-break captions. All of these presentation elements are edited out of the Region 2 releases.

During the 2016 Easter holiday, the entire series and film were shown on ITV3, accompanied by a brand new two-part documentary, Rising Damp Forever, featuring cast and crew recollections on the making of the show.

In November 2020, all four series of the show were made available for streaming in the U.K., U.S., and Canada via the online digital subscription service BritBox.

A guide to the show called Rising Damp: A Celebration was written by Richard Webber and published in 2001. The book features a history of the show's development, along with an episode guide, interviews, and profiles of the people who worked on the show.

The complete scripts for the series were published by Granada Media Group in the 2002 book Rising Damp: The Complete Scripts. This collection does not include the feature film version. In his introduction, Eric Chappell writes: ""When I decided to publish the scripts of Rising Damp my first thought was, did I have them all? What followed was a desperate search in the loft amongst piles of mildewed papers until I found them.… The scripts were written in feverish haste by someone who didn’t really know what he was doing, and who was finding things out as he went along. I didn’t admit this at the time, even to myself. I took the view that sitcom writers fell into two categories: the quick and the dead, and I didn’t intend to be one of the latter!""

In 2005, as part of ITV's 50th anniversary celebration, Rising Damp was one of six shows chosen to be represented on a Royal Mail postage stamp.

Meaning of the title

Rising damp is a condition caused by ground moisture rising up a masonry wall by capillary action. It often occurs where there is no damp-proof course (DPC) or where the DPC has been damaged or bridged. Older houses, such as depicted in the show, were built without damp-proof courses or with a barrier material that is liable to failure.

In the British climate, water infiltration of structures is a common problem, particularly in older houses without a basement or cellar and those constructed before the commonplace use of a damp course. Penetrating damp is visible as a darker patch on the plaster lining of the inner wall, usually starting at floor level on the ground floor and rising up from there, hence the term 'rising damp'. In extreme cases, salt leached out of the wall forms crystals on the surface of the plaster as the water evaporates. The appearance of rising damp in a house suggests a degree of neglect, age, decrepitude etc.

Home releases

This includes the film version, since Carlton had acquired the rights to the film, and through the mergers of the various ITV companies Granada Television subsequently acquired the rights to both the Carlton and Yorkshire Television archives.

The film is a dark comedy about a girl who wants to end it all, and a boy who will change her perception of life. The movie is a dark comedy about life and death. The film is a remake of successful Bengali language film, Hemlock Society, which starred Koel Mallick and Parambrata Chatterjee in lead roles.

Plot
Meera, a young media professional, finds herself cornered every step of the way, as she tries to live a normal life. She feels ignored by her father, betrayed by her fiancé, faces trouble at work. The only escape route she can think of, is taking her own life with a massive dose of sleeping pills.

Enters Anand Prabhu, who stops her at a crucial moment, although he has no plans of making her change her mind. His advice instead, is to go about it systematically. Anand is the founder of ‘Happy Ending Society’, an organization that believes that every person has a right to decide his, or her own fate. Anand gladly offers to make Meera an expert in various ways of ending her life by enrolling her in a 3-day suicide camp, organized by Happy Ending.

While Meera is busy making a choice between life and death surrounded by the like-minded students and over enthusiastic staff, Meera’s father Dr Rajwade leaves no stone unturned to find his estranged daughter.

What happens next? Will Meera finally succeed in carrying out her wish? Does Anand have an ulterior motive in keeping Meera at the Suicide camp? Will Meera reunite with her father? And what is the truth behind ‘Happy Ending Society’?

Walking a thin line between comedy and drama, Welcome Zindagi delivers a poignant message in the garb of entertainment.

7018,['property is investment an good How ?'],"The Omega ratio is a risk-return performance measure of an investment asset, portfolio, or strategy. It was devised by Con Keating and William F. Shadwick in 2002 and is defined as the probability weighted ratio of gains versus losses for some threshold return target. The ratio is an alternative for the widely used Sharpe ratio and is based on information the Sharpe ratio discards.

Omega is calculated by creating a partition in the cumulative return distribution in order to create an area of losses and an area for gains relative to this threshold.

The ratio is calculated as:

where  is the cumulative probability distribution function of the returns and  is the target return threshold defining what is considered a gain versus a loss. A larger ratio indicates that the asset provides more gains relative to losses for some threshold  and so would be preferred by an investor. When  is set to zero the gain-loss-ratio by Bernardo and Ledoit arises as a special case.

Comparisons can be made with the commonly used Sharpe ratio which considers the ratio of return versus volatility. The Sharpe ratio considers only the first two moments of the return distribution whereas the Omega ratio, by construction, considers all moments.

Optimization of the Omega ratio 

The standard form of the Omega ratio is a non-convex function, but it is possible to optimize a transformed version using linear programming. To begin with, Kapsos et al. show that the Omega ratio of a portfolio is:If we are interested in maximizing the Omega ratio, then the relevant optimization problem to solve is:The objective function is still non-convex, so we have to make several more modifications. First, note that the discrete analogue of the objective function is:For  sampled asset class returns, let  and . Then the discrete objective function becomes:With these substitutions, we have been able to transform the non-convex optimization problem into an instance of linear-fractional programming. Assuming that the feasible region is non-empty and bounded, it is possible to transform a linear-fractional program into a linear program. Conversion from a linear-fractional program to a linear program gives us the final form of the Omega ratio optimization problem:where  are the respective lower and upper bounds for the portfolio weights. To recover the portfolio weights, normalize the values of  so that their sum is equal to 1.

7045,"['majlis the to women sending by achieved progress Is ... wrongdoings such to object We ?', 'war waging from men prevents that religion a is Islam that mean that all Does ?']","Khomeinism refers to the religious and political ideas of the leader of the Iranian Revolution, Ruhollah Khomeini. Khomeinism also refers to the ruling clerical class of Iran after 1979. It can also be used to refer to the radicalization of segments of Shia populations of Iran, Iraq, and Lebanon, and the recruitment by the Iranian government of Shia minorities in Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia, and Africa. The word Khomeinist and Khomeinists, derived from Khomeinism, are also used to describe members of Iran's clerical rulers and differentiate them from regular Shia Muslim clerics.

Under Khomeini's leadership, Iran replaced its millennia-old monarchy with a theocratic republic. Khomeini brought about a major paradigm shift in Shia Islam.  He declared Islamic jurists the true holders of not only religious authority but political authority, who must be obeyed as ""an expression of obedience to God"", 
and whose rule has ""precedence over all secondary ordinances in Islam such as prayer, fasting, and pilgrimage.""

Since his death, politics in the Islamic Republic of Iran have been ""largely defined by attempts to claim Khomeini's legacy"", according to at least one scholar, and ""staying faithful to his ideology has been the litmus test for all political activity"" there.

According to Vali Nasr, outside of Iran, Khomeini's influence has been felt among the large Shia populations of Iraq and Lebanon.  In the non-Muslim world, Khomeini had an impact on the West and even Western popular culture where it is said he became ""the virtual face of Islam"" who ""inculcated fear and distrust towards Islam.""

Background

Ayatollah Khomeini was a senior Islamic jurist cleric of Shia (Twelvers) Islam.  Shia theology holds that Wilayah or Islamic leadership belongs to divinely-appointed line of Shia Imams descended from the Islamic prophet Muhammad, the last of which is the 12th Imam, Muhammad al-Mahdi. The God-given (Infallible) knowledge and sense of justice of the Imams makes them the definitive reference for (Shia) Muslims in every aspect of life, religious or otherwise, including governance. However, the twelfth Imam disappeared into what Shia believe is ""occultation"" (ghaybat) in 939 AD and so has not been present to rule over the Muslim community for over a thousand years.

In the absence of the Imam, Shia scholars/religious leaders accepted the idea of non-theocratic leaders (typically a hereditary monarch such as a sultan, king, or shah) managing political affairs, defending  Shia Muslims and their territory, but no consensus emerged among the scholars as to how Muslims should relate to those leaders. Shia jurists have tended to stick to one of three approaches to the state: cooperating with it, becoming active in politics to influence its policies, or most commonly, remaining aloof from it.

For some years, Khomeini opted for the second of these three,  believing Islam should encompass all aspects of life, especially the state, and disapproving of Iran's weak Qajar dynasty, the western concepts and language borrowed in the 1906 constitution, and especially the authoritarian secularism and modernization of the Pahlavi Shahs.  Precedents for this approach included the theory of ""co-working with the just sultan"" put forward by Sayyed Murtaza during the Buyid era in his work ""Al-Resala Al-Amal Ma'a Sultan"" about 1000 years ago, and his idea was developed further by Nasir al-Din al-Tusi. Clerical political influence was institutionalized during the Safavid Empire about 500 years ago. In modern times the Grand Ayatollah Mirza Shirazi intervened against Nasir al-Din Shah when that Qajar Shah gave a 50-year monopoly over the distribution and exportation of tobacco to a foreign non-Muslim. Shirazi issued the famous fatwa against the usage of tobacco as part of the Tobacco Protest.

In 1970 Khomeini broke from this tradition developing a fourth approach to the state, a revolutionary change in Shia Islam proclaiming that monarchy was inherently unjust, and religious legal scholars should not just become involved in politics but rule. During this phase, the Egyptian Jihadist ideologue Sayyid Qutb was an important source of influence to Khomeini and the 1979 Iranian Revolution. In 1984, the Islamic Republic of Iran under Khomeini honoured Qutb's ""martyrdom"" by issuing an iconic postage stamp showing him behind bars. Qutb's works were translated by Iranian Islamists into Persian and enjoyed remarkable popularity both before and after the revolution. Prominent figures such as current Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and his brother Muhammad Ali Khamenei, Aḥmad Aram, Hadi Khosroshahi, etc. translated Qutb's works into Persian.

Legacy

At least one scholar has argued that Khomeini's ""decrees, sermons, interviews, and political pronouncements"" have outlasted his theological works because it is the former and not the latter that the Islamic Republic of Iran ""constantly reprints."" Without the decrees, sermons, interviews, and political pronouncements ""there would have been no Khomeinism [ideology]. Without Khomeinism there would have been no revolution. And without the Islamic Revolution, Khomeini would have been no more than a footnote to Iranian history.""

Improvisational ability

Outside of his doctrinal beliefs, Khomeini has also been noted for being a ""brilliant tactician,"" with a great ""ability to improvise.""

Khomeini once protested the shah's enfranchisement of women, and then encouraged women to participate in his revolution and vote for his government when he needed their numbers. He once promised that clerics would hold only temporary positions in government and then allowed them to hold the most senior positions. He pledged to continue the war against Iraq until its defeat and then abruptly made peace. He once said that the fact that ""I have said something does not mean that I should be bound by my word."" Indeed, it is that suppleness, that ability to improvise that has outlived Khomeini and that continues to pervade the Islamic Republic, keeping it going.

At least one scholar has argued that Khomeini's ability to swing from one ""religiopolitical ... perspective to another"" has been exploited by followers to advance their various and competing agendas. In particular reformists such as Muhammad Khatami in search of more democracy and less theocracy.  Another argues that Khomeini's ""ideological adaptability"" belie the ""label of fundamentalist"" applied to him in both the West and in Iran.

Governance

Rulers
As to how jurists should influence governance, Ayatollah Khomeini's leadership changed direction over time as his views on governance evolved.  On who should rule and what should be the ultimate authority in governance: 
Khomeini originally accepted traditional Shia political theory, writing in ""Kashf-e Asrar"" that, ""We do not say that government must be in the hands of"" an Islamic jurist, ""rather we say that government must be run in accordance with God's law ... ""  suggesting a parliament of Shi'a jurists could choose a just king. ( امام خمينى، كشف الاسرار: ۱۸۷ – ص ۱۸۵)
Later he told his followers that ""Islam proclaims monarchy and hereditary succession wrong and invalid."" Only rule by a leading Islamic jurist (velayat-e faqih   ) would prevent ""innovation"" in Sharia or Islamic law and ensure it was properly followed. The need for this governance of the faqih was ""necessary and self-evident"" to good Muslims.

Once in power and recognizing the need for more flexibility, he finally insisted the ruling jurist need not be one of the most learned, that Sharia rule was subordinate to interests of Islam (Maslaha – `expedient interests` or `public welfare`), and the ""divine government"" as interpreted by the ruling jurists, who could overrule Sharia if necessary to serve those interests.   The Islamic ""government, which is a branch of the absolute governance of the Prophet of God, is among the primary ordinances of Islam, and has precedence over all secondary ordinances such as prayer (salat), fasting (sawm), and pilgrimage (hajj).""

Machinery of government
While Khomeini was keenly focused on the ulama's right to rule and the state's ""moral and ideological foundation"", he did not dwell on the state's actually functioning or the ""particulars"" of its management. According to some scholars (Gheissari and Nasr) Khomeini never ""put forward a systematic definition of the Islamic state and Islamic economics; ... never described its machinery of government, instruments of control, social function, economic processes, or guiding values and principles.""  In his plan for Islamic Government by Islamic Jurists he wrote: ""The entire system of government and administration, together with necessary laws, lies ready for you. If the administration of the country calls for taxes, Islam has made the necessary provision; and if laws are needed, Islam has established them all. ... Everything is ready and waiting. All that remains is to draw up ministerial programs ...""

Danger of conspiracies
Khomeini preached the danger of plots by foreigners and their Iranian agents throughout his political career.  His belief, common among all political persuasions in Iran, can be explained by the domination of Iran's politics for the past 200 years until the Islamic revolution, first by Russia and Britain, later the United States. Foreign agents were involved in all of Iran's three military coups: 1908 [Russian], 1921[British] and 1953 [UK and US].

In his series of speeches in which he argued for rule of the Muslim (and non-Muslim) world by Islamic jurists, Khomeini saw the need for theocratic rule to overcome the conspiracies of colonialists who were responsible for

the decline of Muslim civilization, the conservative `distortions` of Islam, and the divisions between nation-states, between Sunnis and Shiis, and between oppressors and oppressed. He argued that the colonial powers had for years sent Orientalists into the East to misinterpret Islam and the Koran and that the colonial powers had conspired to undermine Islam both with religious quietism and with secular ideologies, especially socialism, liberalism, monarchism, and nationalism. He claimed that Britain had instigated the 1905 Constitutional Revolution to subvert Islam: ""The Iranians who drafted the constitutional laws were receiving instructions directly from their British masters.`""

Khomeini also held the West responsible for a host of contemporary problems. He charged that colonial conspiracies kept the country poor and backward, exploited its resources, inflamed class antagonism, divided the clergy and alienated them from the masses, caused mischief among the tribes, infiltrated the universities, cultivated consumer instincts, and encouraged moral corruption, especially gambling, prostitution, drug addiction, and alcohol consumption.

At least one scholar (Ervand Abrahamian) sees ""far-reaching consequences"" in legacy of belief in ever-present conspiracy.  If conspiracy dominates political action then 
""those with view different from one's own were members of this or that foreign conspiracy. Thus political activists tended to equate competition with treason, ... One does not compromise and negotiate with spies and traitors; one locks them up or else shoots them. ... The result was detrimental for the development of political pluralism in Iran. ... Differences of opinion within organizations could not be accommodated; it was all too easy for leaders to expel dissidents as 'foreign agents'.

Abrahamian believes that what he calls this ""paranoid style"" paved the way for the mass executions of 1981–82, where ""never before in Iran had firing squads executed so many in so short a time over so flimsy an accusation.""

Populism
One scholar argues that Khomeini, ""his ideas, and his movement"" (an ideology he dubs ""Khomeinism"") bears a striking resemblance to populist movements in other countries, particularly those of South America such as Juan Perón and Getúlio Vargas. Like them Khomeini led a ""movement of the propertied middle class"" that  mobilized ""the lower classes, especially the urban poor""  in a ""radical but pragmatic"" protest movement ""against the established order."" It attacked ""the upper class and foreign powers,"" but not property rights, preaching ""a return to `native roots` and eradication of `cosmopolitan ideas.`  It claimed ""a noncapitalist, noncommunist `third way` towards development,""  but was intellectually ""flexible"", emphasizing  ""cultural, national, and political reconstruction,"" not economic and social revolution.""

Like those movements it celebrated the oppressed poor which it designated with a label (mostazafin by Khomeini, descamisados (coatless ones) by Peron,  trabalhadores by Vargas), while actual power flowed from its leader who was ""elevated ... into a demigod towering above the people and embodying their historical roots, future destiny, and revolutionary martyrs.""

Democracy

Whether Khomeini's ideas are compatible with democracy and whether he intended the Islamic Republic to be democratic is disputed. Notable Iranians who believe he did not include Mohammad Taghi Mesbah Yazdi (a senior cleric and main theorist of Iranian ultraconservatives who opposes democracy), Akbar Ganji (a pro-democracy activist and writer who is against Islamic government) and Abdolkarim Soroush (an Iranian philosopher in exile),  according to Reza Parsa writing in the state-run Aftab News. Other followers of Khomeini who believe he did support democracy and that the Islamic Republic is democratic include Ali Khamenei, Mohammad Khatami and Morteza Motahhari.

Khomeini preached for theocratic rule by jurists, but did not completely disavow ""democracy"", making statements at different times indicating both support and opposition to it.  For example, telling a huge crowd of Iranians a month after his return to Iran, ""Do not use this term, `democratic.` That is the Western style,`"" 

One explanation for this contradiction is what Khomeini meant by ""democracy."" According to scholar Shaul Bakhash, it's highly unlikely Khomeini defined the term to mean ""a Western parliamentary democracy"" when he told others he wanted Iran to be democratic. 
Khomeini believed that the huge turnout of Iranians in anti-Shah demonstrations during the revolution meant that Iranians had already voted in a `referendum` for an Islamic republic, and that in Muslim countries Islam and Islamic law,  
truly belong to the people. In contrast, in a republic or a constitutional monarchy, most of those claiming to be representatives of the majority of the people will approve anything they wish as law and then impose it on the entire population. 

In drawing up the constitution of his Islamic Republic, he and his supporters agreed to include Western-democratic elements, such as an elected parliament and president, but some argue he believed Islamic elements, not Western-style elected parliaments and presidents, should prevail in government.   After the ratifying of the Islamic constitution he told an interviewer that the constitution in no way contradicted democracy because the `people love the clergy, have faith in the clergy, and want to be guided by the clergy` and that it was right that Supreme Leader oversee the work of the non-clerical officials `to make sure they don't make mistakes or go against the law and the Quran.' 

As the revolution was consolidated terms like ""democracy"" and ""liberalism"" – considered praiseworthy in the West – became words of criticism, while ""revolution"" and ""revolutionary"" were terms of praise.
According to Khomeini, proponents of ""democracy"" as well as ""Islamic democracy"" are misguided. He stated in a 1980 interview:""But as for ‘democratic,’ we won’t accept it even if you put it next to ‘Islamic.’ Even apart from this, as I said in an earlier talk, to juxtapose “democratic” and “Islamic” is an insult to Islam.

Still another scholar, non-Iranian Daniel Brumberg, argues that Khomeini's statements on politics were simply not ""straightforward, coherent, or consistent,"" and that in particular he contradicted his writings and statements on the primacy of the rule of the jurist with repeated statements on the importance of the leading role of the parliament, such as `the Majlis heads all affairs`, and `the majlis is higher than all the positions which exist in the country.`  This, according to Brumberg, has created a legacy where his followers ""exploited these competing notions of authority"" to advance ""various agendas of their own."" Reformist seizing on his statements about the importance of majlis, and theocrats on those of rule by the clergy.

Over the decades since the revolution, Iran has not evolved towards a more liberal representative democratic system as some reformists and democrats had predicted, nor has theocratic rule of Islamic jurists spread to other countries as its founder had hoped.

Human rights
Before taking power Khomeini expressed support for the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  ""We would like to act according to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. We would like to be free. We would like independence,"" he stated. However once in power Khomeini took a firm line against dissent, warning opponents of theocracy for example: ""I repeat for the last time: abstain from holding meetings, from blathering, from publishing protests. Otherwise I will break your teeth."" Khomeini believed that since Islamic government was essential for Islam, what threatened the government threatened Islam.

 Since God Almighty has commanded us to follow the Messenger and the holders of authority, our obeying them is actually an expression of obedience to God.

Iran adopted an alternative human rights declaration, the Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam, in 1990 (one year after Khomeini's death), which differs from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, requiring law to be in accordance with Sharia, denying complete equality with men for women, and forbidding speech that violates the ""dignity of Prophets"", or ""undermines moral and ethical values.""

One observer, Iranian political historian Ervand Abrahamian, believes that some of the more well-known violations of international human rights initiated by Khomeini—the fatwa to kill British-citizen author Salman Rushdie and the mass executions of leftist political prisoners in 1988—can be explained best as a legacy for his followers.  Abrahamian argues Khomeini wanted to ""forge unity"" among ""his disparate followers"", ""raise formidable – if not insurmountable – obstacles in the way of any future leader hoping to initiate a detente with the West,"" and most importantly to ""weed out the half-hearted from the true believers"",  such as heir-designate Ayatollah Hussein-Ali Montazeri who protested the killings and was dismissed from his position.

Economics
In the realm of economics, Khomeini was known both for his lack of interest and conflicting views on the subject.

He famously replied to a question before the revolution about how the Islamic Republic would manage Iran's economy by saying economics was ""for donkeys"" (also translated as ""for fools""), and  expressed impatience with those who complained about the inflation and shortages following the revolution saying: ""I cannot believe that the purpose of all these sacrifices was to have less expensive melons."" His lack of attention has been described as ""possibly one factor explaining the inchoate performance of the Iranian economy since the 1979 revolution,"" (along with the mismanagement by clerics trained in Islamic law but not economic science).

Khomeini has also been described as being ""quite genuinely of two minds"", and of having ""ambiguous and contradictory attitudes"" on the role of the state in the economy. He agreed with conservative clerics and the bazaar (traditional merchant class) on the importance of strict sharia law and respect for the sanctity of private property, but also made populist promises such as free water and electricity and government-provided homes for the poor, which could only be provided, if at all, by massive government intervention in the economy in violation of traditional Shariah law. While Khomeini was alive the conflict attitudes were represented in the clash between the populists of the Parliament and the conservatives of the Guardian Council.

After his death until 1997, the ""bazaari side"" of the legacy predominated with the regime of President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani. Rafsanjani and Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, emphasized `reconstruction,` `realism,` `work discipline,` `managerial skills,` `modern technology,` `expertise and competence,` `individual self-reliance,` `entrepreneurship,` and `stability.`"" 

The populist side of Khomeini's economic legacy is said to be found in President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who allegedly ""mirrored"" Khomeini's disdain for the ""donkey"" science of economics, wearing ""his contempt for economic orthodoxy as a badge of honour"", and overseeing sluggish growth and rising inflation and unemployment under his administration.

Khomeini strongly opposed Marxism.  `Atheistic Marxists` were the one group he excluded from the broad coalition of anti-Shah groups he worked to rally behind his leadership. In his last will and testament, he urged future generations to respect property on the grounds that free enterprise turns the `wheels of the economy` and prosperity would produce `social justice` for all, including the poor. Islam differs sharply from communism. Whereas we respect private property, communism advocates the sharing of all things – including wives and homosexuals.  What one scholar has called the populist thrust of Khomeini can be found in the fact that after the revolution, revolutionary tribunals expropriated  ""agribusinesses, large factories, and luxury homes belonging to the former elite,"" but were careful to avoid ""challenging the concept of private property.""

On the other hand, Khomeini's revolutionary movement was influenced by Islamic leftist and thinker Ali Shariati, and the leftist currents of the 1960s and 1970s.  Khomeini proclaimed Islam on the side of the mustazafin and against exploiters and imperialists. In part for this reason, a large section of Iran's economy was nationalized during the revolution. At least as of 2003, Iran's public sector and government workforce remains very large. Despite complaints by free marketers, ""about 60% of the economy is directly controlled and centrally planned by the state, and another 10–20% is in the hands of five semi-governmental foundations, who control much of the non-oil economy and are accountable to no one except the supreme leader.""

Women in politics
Before the Revolution, Khomeini expressed the following:
In an Islamic order, women enjoy the same rights as men – rights to education, work, ownership, to vote in elections and to be voted in. Women are free, just like men to decide their own destinies and activities.

After the Revolution, Khomeini opposed allowing women to serve in parliament, likening it to prostitution. 
We are against this prostitution. We object to such wrongdoings ... Is progress achieved by sending women to the majlis? Sending women to these centers is nothing but corruption.

Religious philosophy, fiqh, teachings
Khomeini made a number of changes to Shia clerical system. Along with his January 1989 ruling that sharia was subordinate to the revolution, he affirmed against tradition that the fatwa pronounced by a grand ayatollah survived that ayatollah (such as the fatwa to kill Salman Rushdie), and defrocked Ayatollah Mohammad Kazem Shariatmadari, a political opponent.

Fiqh
In Fiqh, (Islamic jurisprudence) some scholars have argued Khomeini championed innovative reinterpretations of doctrine, prompted by the challenges of managing a country of 50 million plus.

Use of Maslaha, or maslahat (`expedient interests` or `public welfare`). This was a common concept among Sunni, but ""before the 1979 revolution most"" Shi'ite jurists had ""rejected maslahat as a dangerous innovation (Bid‘ah).""
Wider use of ""secondary ordinances"". Clerics had traditionally argued that the government could issue these ""when addressing a narrow range of contractual issues not directly addressed in the Qur'an."" Khomeini called for their use to deal with the deadlock between the Majles and the Council of Guardians
Ijtihad

Esmat
Esmat is perfection through faith. Khomeini believed not only that truly just and divine Islamic government need not wait for the return of the 12th Imam/Mahdi, but that ""divinely bestowed freedom from error and sin"" (esmat) was not the exclusive property of the prophets and imams. Esmat required ""nothing other than perfect faith"" and could be achieved by a Muslim who reaches that state. Hamid Dabashi argues Khomeini's theory of Esmat from faith helped ""to secure the all-important attribute of infallibility for himself as a member of the awlia' [friend of God] by eliminating the simultaneous theological and Imamological problems of violating the immanent expectation of the Mahdi."" Thus by ""securing"" this ""attribute of infallibility for himself"", Khomeini reassured Shia Muslims who might otherwise be hesitant about granting him the same ruling authority due the 12 Imams.

The Prophets
Khomeini believed the Prophets have not yet achieved their ""purpose"".   In November 1985 he told radio listeners, ""I should say that so far the purpose of the Prophets has seldom been realized. Very little."" Aware of the controversial nature of the statement he warned more conservative clerics that ""tomorrow court mullahs . . . [should] not say that Khomeini said that the Prophet is incapable of achieving his aims."" He also controversially stated that Fatimah, the daughter of Muhammad, was superior in status to the prophets of God.

Khomeini's authority and charismatic personality prevented less popular jurists from protesting these changes as un-Islamic Bid‘ah.

Istishhad

Iran–Iraq War
Perhaps the most significant legacy of Khomeini internationally is a broader definition of martyrdom to include Istishhad, or ""self-martyrdom"".  Khomeini believed martyrdom could come not only from ""inadvertent"" death but ""deliberate"" as well. While martyrdom has always been celebrated in Islam and martyrs promised a place in heaven, (Q3:169–171) the idea that opportunities for martyrdom were important has not always been so common. Khomeini not only praised the large numbers of young Shia Iranians who became ""shahids"" during the Iran–Iraq War  but asserted the war was ""God's hidden gift"", or as one scholar of Khomeini put it, ""a vital outlet through which Iran's young martyrs experienced mystical transcendence."" Khomeini explained:

""If the great martyr (Imam Husayn ibn Ali) ... confined himself to praying ... the great tragedy of Kabala would not have come about ... Among the contemporary ulema, if the great Ayatollah ... Shirazi ... thought like these people [who do not fight for Islam], a war would not have taken place in Iraq ... all those Muslims would not have been martyred.""

Death might seem like a tragedy to some but in reality ...

If you have any tie or link binding you to this world in love, try to sever it. This world, despite all its apparent splendor and charm, is too worthless to be loved

Khomeini never wavered from his faith in the war as God's will, and observers have related a number of examples of his impatience with those who tried to convince him to stop it. When the war seemed to become a stalemate with hundreds of thousands killed and civilian areas being attacked by missiles, Khomeini was approached by Ayatollah Mehdi Haeri Yazdi, a grand ayatollah and former student with family ties to Khomeini. He pleaded with Khomeini to find a way to stop the killing saying, ""it is not right for Muslims to kill Muslims."" Khomeini answered reproachfully, asking him, ""Do you also criticize God when he sends an earthquake?"" On another occasion a delegation of Muslim heads of state in Tehran to offer to mediate an end to the war were kept waiting for two hours and given no translator when Khomeini finally did talk to them.

Lebanon, Palestine, Iraq
While suicide bombings did not win the Iran–Iraq War for Iran, it did spread to Lebanon, where it won victories for the Iraqi Islamic Da'wa party, Shia 'allies' of the Islamic Revolution there.  The 1983 bombings against U.S. and French peacekeeping troops by Hizballah killed over 300 and drove the US and French from Lebanon. Another longer bombing campaign did likewise to the Israeli army.  Khomeini is credited by some with inspiring these ""suicide bombers"".

The power of suicide operations as a military tactic has been described by Shia Lebanese as an equalizer where faith and piety are used to counter superior military power of the Western unbeliever:
You look at it with a Western mentality. You regard it as barbaric and unjustified. We, on the other hand, see it as another means of war, but one which is also harmonious with our religion and beliefs. Take for example, an Israeli warplane or, better still, the American and British air power in the Gulf War. .... The goal of their mission and the outcome of their deeds was to kill and damage enemy positions just like us ... The only difference is that they had at their disposal state-of-the-art and top-of-the-range means and weaponry to achieve their aims. We have the minimum basics ... We ... do not seek material rewards, but heavenly one in the hereafter. 

The victory of Hezbollah is known to have inspired Hamas in Palestine, and al-Qaeda in its worldwide bombing campaign. In the years after Khomeini's death, ""Martyrdom operations"" or ""suicide bombing"" have spread beyond Shia Islam and beyond attacks on military and are now a major force in the Muslim world. According to one estimate, as of early 2008, 1,121 Muslim suicide bombers have blown themselves up in Iraq alone.

Ironically and tragically, in the last few years, thousands of Muslims, particularly Shia, have been victims, not just initiators, of martyrdom operations, with many civilians and even mosques and shrines being targeted, particularly in Iraq. Salafi Jihadi ideologue Abu Musab Al-Zarqawi declared ""all-out war"" on Shia Muslims in Iraq in response to a US-Iraqi offensive on the town of Tal Afar.  In 2007 some of the Shia ulema have responded by declaring suicide bombing haram:

""حتي كساني كه با انتحار مي‌آيند و مي‌زنند عده‌اي را مي‌كشند، آن هم به عنوان عمليات انتحاري، اينها در قعر جهنم هستند""""Even those who kill people with suicide bombing, these shall meet the flames of hell.""

Shia rituals
Khomeini showed little interest in the rituals of Shia Islam such as the Day of Ashura. Unlike earlier Iranian shahs or the Awadh's nawabs, he never presided over any Ashura observances, nor visited the enormously popular shrine of the eighth Imam in Mashad. This discouraging of popular Shia piety and Shia traditions by Khomeini and his core supporters has been explained by at least one observer as a product of their belief that Islam was first and foremost about Islamic law, and that the revolution itself was of ""equal significance"" to Battle of Karbala where the Imam Husayn was martyred.

This legacy is reflected in the surprise sometimes shown by foreign Shia hosts in Pakistan and elsewhere when visiting Iranian officials, such as Fawzah Rafsanjani, show their disdain for Shia shrines. And perhaps also in President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's May 2005 statement that ""the Iranian revolution was of the same `essence` as Imam Husayn's movement.""

Sternness and austerity
Companions and followers of the Ayatollah Khomeini have many stories of his disinterest in his personal wealth and comfort and concern for others.

While the Imam was sometimes flexible over doctrine, changing positions on divorce, music, birth control, he was much less accommodating with those he believed to be the enemies of Islam. Khomeini emphasized not only righteous militancy and rage but hatred,
And I am confident that the Iranian people, particularly our youth, will keep alive in their hearts anger and hatred for the criminal Soviet Union and the warmongering United States. This must be until the banner of Islam flies over every house in the world.

Salman Rushdie's apology for his book (following Khomeini's fatwa to kill the author) was rejected by Khomeini, who told Muslims: ""Even if Salman Rushdie repents and becomes the most pious man of all time, it is incumbent on every Muslim to employ everything he has got, his life and wealth, to send him to Hell.""

Khomeini felt let down by advisers who he felt had persuaded him to make unwise decisions against his better judgment, appointing people to posts who he later denounced.  ""I swear to God that I was against appointing Medi Bazargan as the first prime minister, too, but I considered him to be a decent person. I also swear to God that I did not vote for Bani Sadr to become president either. On all these occasions I submitted to the advice of my friends."" Before being revised in April 1989, the Iranian constitution called for the supreme leader to be a leading cleric (Marja), something Khomeini says he opposed ""since from the very beginning.""

He also preached of Islam's essentially serious nature:

Allah did not create man so that he could have fun. The aim of creation was for mankind to be put to the test through hardship and prayer. An Islamic regime must be serious in every field. There are no jokes in Islam. There is no humor in Islam. There is no fun in Islam. There can be no fun and joy in whatever is serious. Islam does not allow swimming in the sea and is opposed to radio and television serials. Islam, however, allows marksmanship, horseback riding and competition ...The Spirit of Allah: Khomeini and the Islamic Revolution (1986), by Amir Taheri, Adler & Adler, p. 259

and the all-encompassing nature of Islam, and thus of its law and its government,
 Islam and divine governments ... have commandments for everybody, everywhere, at any place, in any condition. If a person were to commit an immoral dirty deed right next to his house, Islamic governments have business with him. .... Islam has rules for every person, even before birth, before his marriage, until his marriages, pregnancy, birth, until upbringing of the child, the education of the adult, until puberty, youth, until old age, until death, into the grave, and beyond the grave.

Muslim and non-Muslim world

Spread of Shia Islam
Khomeini strongly supported the spread of Islam throughout the world.

We shall export our revolution to the whole world. Until the cry 'There is no god but Allah' resounds over the whole world, there will be struggle.

Once we have won the war [with Iraq], we shall turn to other wars. For that would not be enough. We have to wage war until all corruption, all disobedience of Islamic law ceases [throughout the world]. The Quran commands: “War! War until victory!” A religion without war is a crippled religion... Allah be praised, our young warriors are putting this command into effect and fighting. They know that to kill the infidels is one of the noblest missions Allah has reserved for mankind.

Not just as a faith but as a state.

Establishing the Islamic state world-wide belong to the great goals of the revolution.

Which he believed would replace both capitalism and communism

... `We have often proclaimed this truth in our domestic and foreign policy, namely that we have set as our goal the world-wide spread of the influence of Islam and the suppression of the rule of the world conquerors ... We wish to cause the corrupt roots of Zionism, capitalism and Communism to wither throughout the world. We wish, as does God almighty, to destroy the systems which are based on these three foundations, and to promote the Islamic order of the Prophet ... in the world of arrogance.

Khomeini held these views both prior to and following the revolution. The following was published in 1942 and republished during his years as supreme leader:

Jihad or Holy War, which is for the conquest of [other] countries and kingdoms, becomes incumbent after the formation of the Islamic state in the presence of the Imam or in accordance with his command. Then Islam makes it incumbent on all adult males, provided they are not disabled and incapacitated, to prepare themselves for the conquest of [other] countries so that the writ of Islam is obeyed in every country in the world... those who study Islamic Holy War will understand why Islam wants to conquer the whole world. All the countries conquered by Islam or to be conquered in the future will be marked for everlasting salvation... Islam says: Whatever good there is exists thanks to the sword and in the shadow of the sword! People cannot be made obedient except with the sword! The sword is the key to Paradise, which can be opened only for Holy Warriors! There are hundreds of other [Qur'anic] psalms and Hadiths [sayings of the Prophet] urging Muslims to value war and to fight. Does all that mean that Islam is a religion that prevents men from waging war? I spit upon those foolish souls who make such a claim.

Unity of the Ummah

Khomeini made efforts to establish unity among Ummah. ""During the early days of the Revolution, Khomeini endeavored to bridge the gap between Shiites and Sunnis by forbidding criticizing the Caliphs who preceded Ali — an issue that causes much animosity between the two sects. Also, he declared it permissible for Shiites to pray behind Sunni imams."" These measures have been viewed as being legitimised by the Shia practice of taqiyya (dissimulation), in order to maintain Muslim unity and fraternity.

Shortly before he died the famous South Asian Islamist Abul Ala Maududi paid Khomeini the compliment of saying he wished he had accomplished what Khomeini had, and that he would have like to have been able to visit Iran to see the revolution for himself.

He supported Unity Week and International Day of Quds. However, according to Sa`id Hawwa in his book al-Khumayniyya, Khomeini's real aim was to spread Shi'ism through the use of such tactics as taqiyya and anti-Zionist rhetoric. In fact, Khomeini  held strong anti-Sunni views throughout his writings.  In his treatise ""Kashf al Asrar"" , Khomeini accused Abubakr and Umar, companions of Muhammad highly revered by Sunni Muslims, of kufr (disbelief) and of altering the Qur'an. He called them ""ignorant fools, hobos and tyrants"" unworthy of being Caliphs and also accused the vast majority of the Companions as being party to their alleged ""crimes"". In addition, Khomeini alleged that Sunnis had fabricated hadiths for political purposes and that Sunni scholars were pawns of the Great Satan. Khomeini had portrayed non-Shia schools in general of being submissive to rulers, while Shias always supported revolution against tyrants. Nevertheless, he called upon the Sunni masses to shun their scholars and join hands with the Islamic Revolution against ""America and Zionism"". Since the death of Khomeini, Iranian leaders have been more sectarian and Sunnis suffer from systemic discrimination.

Also, Khomeini's ""Islamic Brotherhood"" did not extend to the Wahhabi regime of Saudi Arabia, whom he vehemently hated and regarded as apostates. Under his leadership the Iranian government cut off all relations with Saudi Arabia. Khomeini even declared that Iran may one day start good diplomatic relations with the US or Iraq but never with Saudi Arabia. Iran did not re-establish diplomatic relations with Saudi Arabia until March 1991, after Khomeini's death.

Shia revival
The Iranian revolution ""awakened"" Shia around the world, who outside of Iran were subordinate to Sunnis. Shia ""became bolder in their demands of rights and representations"", and in some instances Khomeini supported them. In Pakistan, he is reported to have told Pakistan military ruler Zia ul-Haq that he would do to al-Haq ""what he had done to the Shah"" if al-Haq mistreated Shia.    When tens of thousands of Shia protested for exemption from Islamic taxes based on Sunni law, al-Haq conceded to their demands.

Shia Islamist groups that sprang up during the 1980s, often ""receiving financial and political support from Tehran"" include the Amal Movement of Musa al-Sadr and later the Hezbollah movement in Lebanon, Islamic Dawa Party in Iraq, Hizb-e Wahdat in Afghanistan, Tehreek-e-Jafaria in Pakistan, al-Wifaq in Bahrain, and Hezbollah Al-Hejaz and al-Haraka al-Islahiya al-Islamiya in Saudi Arabia.  Shia were involved in the 1979–80 riots and demonstrations in oil-rich eastern Saudi Arabia, the 1981 Bahraini coup d'état attempt and the 1983 Kuwait bombings.

Neither East nor West
Khomeini strongly opposed alliances with, or imitation of, Eastern (communist) and Western Bloc (capitalist) nations.

... in our domestic and foreign policy, ... we have set as our goal the world-wide spread of the influence of Islam ... We wish to cause the corrupt roots of Zionism, capitalism and Communism to wither throughout the world. We wish, as does God almighty, to destroy the systems which are based on these three foundations, and to promote the Islamic order of the Prophet ...

In the Last Message, The Political and Divine Will of His Holiness the Imam Khomeini, there are no less than 21 warnings on the dangers of what the west or east, or of pro-western or pro-eastern agents are either doing, have done or will do to Islam and the rest of the world.

In particular he loathed the United States
 ... the foremost enemy of Islam ... a terrorist state by nature that has set fire to everything everywhere ... oppression of Muslim nations is the work of the USA ...
and its ally Israel
the international Zionism does not stop short of any crime to achieve its base and greedy desires, crimes that the tongue and pen are ashamed to utter or write.

Khomeini believed that Iran should strive towards self-reliance. Rather siding with one or the other of the world's two blocs (at the time of the revolution), he favored the allying of Muslim states with each other, or rather their union in one state. In his book Islamic Government he hinted governments would soon fall into line if an Islamic government was established.
If the form of government willed by Islam were to come into being, none of the governments now existing in the world would be able to resist it; they would all capitulate.

In the West
After the collapse of the Eastern Bloc and the Soviet Union, Khomeini's legacy lives on in the Western world. From the beginning of the Iranian Revolution to the time of his death Khomeini's ""glowering visage became the virtual face of Islam in Western popular culture"" and ""inculcated fear and distrust towards Islam."" He is said to have made the word Ayatollah ""a synonym for a dangerous madman ... in popular parlance."" His fatwa calling for the death of secular Muslim author Salman Rushdie in particular was seen by some as a deft attempt to create a wedge issue that would prevent Muslims from imitating the West by ""dividing Muslims from Westerners along the default lines of culture."" The fatwa was greeted with headlines such as one in the popular British newspaper the Daily Mirror referring to Khomeini as ""that Mad Mullah"", observations in a British magazine that the Ayatollah seemed ""a familiar ghost from the past – one of those villainous Muslim clerics, a Faqir of Ipi or a mad Mullah, who used to be portrayed, larger than life, in popular histories of the British Empire"", and laments that Khomeini fed the Western stereotype of ""the backward, cruel, rigid Muslim, burning books and threatening to kill the blasphemer."" The fatwa indicated Khomeini's contempt for the right to life; for the presumption of innocence; for the rule of law; and for national sovereignty, since he ordered Rushdie killed 'wherever he is found' 

This was particularly the case in the largest nation of the Western bloc—the United States (or ""Great Satan"")—where Khomeini and the Islamic Republic are remembered for the American embassy hostage taking and accused of sponsoring hostage-taking and terrorist attacks—especially using the Lebanese Shi'a Islamic group Hezbollah—and which continues to apply economic sanctions against Iran.  Popular feeling during the hostage-taking was so high in the United States that some Iranians complained that they felt the need to hide their Iranian identity for fear of physical attack even at universities.

7174,"['Ever You Have "" \'s Brandy ( time the at popular songs of medley a performed girls The ?']","Signs is an American reggaeton duet from Springfield, Massachusetts. Originally a trio, the group eventually became a duo composed of Yarimar Huertas and Yalixia Figueroa.

Biography

History
The group was originated by member Yarimar, Tarrah & Kiara for a fifth grade talent show. Yarimar's mother, Margie Rosario, set about developing an act based on their singing and dancing, under the name Spring Girls (because of Springfield), which included Yarimar, Kiara smith & Tarrah Garvy. The girls performed a medley of songs popular at the time (Brandy's ""Have You Ever?"", Britney Spears's ""...Baby One More Time"", Monica's ""Angel of Mine"", Cher's ""Believe"", and TLC's ""No Scrubs"").

The girls enjoyed their time together so much that after the talent show the girls decided to cement the band. Margie Rosario became the girls’ manager and decided on keeping the girls unsigned until they turned 18. The girls went through several name changes and line-up changes between 2000 and 2006. Eventually the girls settled on the name Signs because the girls all had different astrological signs.

In late 2006 the band featured lead singer Yakasty Abreu, Elizabeth Espiritusanto, Syntasia Gray, LaKeya Wilson, Annie Lee & Shannon Johnson. This particular line-up was short lived when member Rashell Gordon was added to the group. Before this all member changes in the group seemed friendly but disputes between Shannon and the other girls caused the group to temporarily split. Yarimar rejoined with Syntasia and new members Stephanie Rosado (who was Yari’s cousin) and Veronica Colon (who was Stephanie's brother's girlfriend).

Due to her pregnancy, Veronica Colon has left the group and manager Margie has replaced her with 17-year-old Yalixia Figueroa. Syntasia Gray and Stephanie Rosado also have left but the girls decided on making the band a duo only.

Solo projects
During the years the girls have been together some of them have also done some solo endeavors.

Yakasty Abreu and Elizabeth Espiritusanto have done several solo performances outside of the band and have stated that ""If things don't work out with the girls then we can always do our own solo thing.""

Yarimar Huertas considers her vocal skills to be very weak and probably wouldn’t be a singer on her own. She has however gone into the field of modeling and at one point was a Barbizon model.

Syntasia Gray has also done solo singing projects. Besides music Syntasia is also a published poet.

Yalixia Figueroa has also stepped into the field of modeling and has done several runway shows.

Demo songs
Between 2005 and 2007 the girls have been in the studio recording songs. Even when members were changed no song was re-recorded to include new vocals. The list of songs are:

 ""A Fool's Game""
 ""Angel"" (Amanda Perez cover)
 ""Birthday""
 ""Bring Me Along""
 ""Down Low""
 ""Everyday""
 ""Girl Talk""
 ""Go (It's Your B'day)""
 ""Got Me Hooked""
 ""Hottest Chicks in the Game""
 ""I Love You!""

 ""I'm Goin' Dance""
 ""I'm Gonna Tell""
 ""It Ain't the Same""
 ""Play Me Your Love""
 ""Pray Baby""
 ""Signs"" (Beyoncé cover)
 ""Struggle""
 ""Takin’ Me Over""
 ""To Whom It May Concern""
 ""You Got To Love It""
 ""You Gotta Be""

Live covers
The band frequently covers songs from several different female artist including Janet Jackson, Destiny's Child, Rihanna, Brandy, Aaliyah, and Monica. The only exception to this is when the girls make a female version of male songs or do a dance interlude to them while catching their breath.  They have also covered Iron Maiden's Run to the hills.

7185,"[""Waldo 's Where ?""]","Hugh Charles McBarron Jr. (1902–1992) was an American commercial artist. Known for his wide body of work featuring the United States Armed Forces, he is considered by many to have been the ""dean of military illustrators.""

Biography
McBarron was born in Chicago, Illinois, where he lived all his life.  He was born and raised in a family home on the Near North Side of Chicago that was rebuilt by his maternal grandfather after the Great Chicago Fire of 1871.

He began formal art training at age seven in classes at the Art Institute of Chicago.  Upon graduation from Waller High School (now known as Lincoln Park High School), Chicago, he made a sudden decision to forego admission to Northwestern University's Medill School to pursue comprehensive study at the Art Institute of Chicago. His favored artists and illustrators included Van Dyck, Winslow Homer, Howard Pyle, NC Wyeth, JC Leyendecker, Maxfield Parrish and John Singer Sargent.

While informally researching military uniforms and weapons, McBarron realized that many illustrations of military scenes were inaccurate.  He became committed to knowledgeable portrayal of detail and historical accuracy.  An example is his mature 1975 work Soldiers of the American Revolution: A Sketchbook.

To support his studies, McBarron compiled an extensive personal library and collection of arms, armour, uniforms, artifacts, and research resources and archives.  He drew on these and public sources for reference when creating his more than 60-year body of work. McBarron created all his illustrations from his studio in Chicago.  Throughout his entire career, he maintained professional studios in Downtown Chicago, as well his home-based studio.

McBarron often drafted and completed his work in non-stop fashion. He embraced and used to his advantage then-contemporary mediums such as Black-and-White photos, Polaroid photos, and Kodak 16-mm movies.  His use of photography and other such resources helped him produce illustrations and artworks that had accurate details.

To go along with his reading and research, McBarron visited and studied many of the major battlefields and historic sights located in the original 13 colonies, the Western Reserve, and Canada.

He was known for his ability to comprehend and explain complexities of clothing and uniform construction.  McBarron would recreate uniform patterns which he would use to sew replicas to serve as historically accurate models for his work.  While attending a luncheon with a fellow historian who was writing about a particular uniform, McBarron sketched out its pattern on a cocktail napkin.  The fellow historian surreptitiously pocketed McBarron's impromptu sketch, and later included its reproduction within an authoritative work on military dress.

McBarron often served as an expert consultant to the United States Marine Corps History Division,  United States Army Center of Military History, the Smithsonian Institution, various military museums, and individual branches of the US Armed Forces.  He also consulted with Encyclopædia Britannica and World Book Encyclopedia.  McBarron served as a mentor, resource, and guide to many devotees, illustrators, and historians.

Mr. McBarron made uniform illustrations for the Military Collector & Historian, journal of the Company of Military Historians, from the work of Lieutenant Colonel Edwin North McClellan, USMC (Uniforms of the American Marines 1775 to 1829 1932, reprinted 1974, 1982):
""Captain Robert Mullan's Company of Continental Marines, 1779"" (MC&H, volume I, number 1, plate #2, pp 2-3)
""U.S. Marine Corps, Circa 1805-1818"" (MC&H, volume II, number 2, plate #24, pp. 25-28)

While known for his military illustrations, throughout his career he also created illustrations for fashion, advertising and mail order catalogues.  McBarron produced such popular-culture icons as Captain Midnight, the Jolly Green Giant and Buster Brown.  He portrayed himself as a subject within his works, and can be found in virtually all his military depictions.  Where's Waldo? illustrator Martin Handford, in a Time Magazine article, cited McBarron as his primary influence.

Marriage and family
McBarron married Mary Cecilia Pugh.  Together they had a son and a daughter.

After his death, McBarron was interred next to his wife at Calvary Cemetery, Evanston, Illinois.

In Track 1, there is a brief instance of backmasking when the ""opening act"" is introduced. When played in reverse, the announcer can be heard saying, ""Mr. Reginald Warrington. Give it up for Reginald Warrington!"" This was the name of Dave Chappelle's stand-up comedian character in the film, The Nutty Professor.
There is another use of backmasking at the start of track 15. When played in reverse, the ""favorite joke"" is as follows: ""So I'm walking down the street, right? And I saw this prostitute, right? And I said, 'How much?' She said, 'For $300, I'll do anything you want.' I said, 'Bitch, paint my house!'"" The joke, played forwards, is sampled in the Soul Coughing song ""$300"" on El Oso.
 Fellow comedian Dave Chappelle is one of the voices heard on the album. When a group of black people are complimenting Chris on ""Niggas vs. Black People,"" Chappelle is the one that asks Rock if he ""smokes weed."" Chappelle also appears in the ""opening act"".

He won numerous awards for his works. Darwish used Palestine as a metaphor for the loss of Eden, birth and resurrection, and the anguish of dispossession and exile. He has been described as incarnating and reflecting ""the tradition of the political poet in Islam, the man of action whose action is poetry."" He also served as an editor for several literary magazines in Palestine.

Biography
Mahmoud Darwish was born in 1941 in al-Birwa in the Western Galilee, the second child of Salim and Houreyyah Darwish. His family were landowners. His mother was illiterate, but his grandfather taught him to read. During the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, his village was captured by Israeli forces and the family fled to Lebanon, first to Jezzin and then Damour. Their home village was razed and destroyed by the IDF to prevent its inhabitants from returning to their homes inside the new Jewish state.

A year later, Darwish's family returned to the Acre area, which was part of Israel, and settled in Deir al-Asad. Darwish attended high school in Kafr Yasif, two kilometers north of Jadeidi. He eventually moved to Haifa.

He published his first book of poetry, Asafir bila ajniha, or ""Wingless Birds,"" at the age of 19. He initially published his poems in Al Jadid, the literary periodical of the Israeli Communist Party, eventually becoming its editor. Later, he was assistant editor of Al Fajr, a literary periodical published by the Israeli Workers Party (Mapam).

Darwish left Israel in 1970 to study in the Soviet Union (USSR). He attended the Lomonosov Moscow State University for one year, before moving to Egypt and Lebanon. When he joined the PLO (Palestine Liberation Organization) in 1973, he was banned from reentering Israel.

In 1995, he returned to attend the funeral of his colleague, Emile Habibi, receiving a permit to remain in Haifa for four days. That year Darwish was allowed to settle in Ramallah, but he said he felt he was living in exile there, and did not consider the West Bank his ""private homeland.""

Darwish was twice married and divorced. His first wife was the writer Rana Kabbani. After they divorced, in the mid-1980s, he married an Egyptian translator, Hayat Heeni. He had no children. The ""Rita"" of Darwish's poems was a Jewish woman whom he loved when he was living in Haifa. The relationship was the subject of the film Write Down, I Am an Arab by filmmaker Ibtisam Mara'ana Menuhin, an Arab Muslim woman married to a Jewish man. (While such relationships are rare today, they were more common during the Palestinian Mandate period, and among communists, who were united by class struggle.)

Darwish had a history of heart disease, suffering a heart attack in 1984. He had two heart operations, in 1984 and 1998.

His final visit to Israel was on 15 July 2007, to attend a poetry recital at Mt. Carmel Auditorium in Haifa. There he criticized the factional violence between Fatah and Hamas as a ""suicide attempt in the streets.""

Literary career
Over his lifetime, Darwish published more than 30 volumes of poetry and eight books of prose. At one time or another, he was editor of the periodicals Al-Jadid, Al Fajr, Shu'un Filistiniyya, and Al-Karmel. He was also one of the contributors of Lotus, a literary magazine financed by Egypt and the Soviet Union. 

By the age of seventeen, Darwish was writing poetry about the suffering of the refugees in the Nakba and the inevitability of their return, and had begun reciting his poems at poetry festivals. Seven years later, on 1 May 1965, when the young Darwish read his poem ""Bitaqat huwiyya"" [""Identity Card""] to a crowd in a Nazareth movie house, there was a tumultuous reaction. Within days the poem had spread throughout the country and the Arab world. Published in his second volume ""Leaves of Olives"" (Haifa, 1964), the six stanzas of the poem repeat the cry ""Write down: I am an Arab."" In the 1970s, ""Darwish, as a Palestinian poet of the Resistance committed himself to the ... objective of nurturing the vision of defeat and disaster (after the June War of 1967), so much so that it would 'gnaw at the hearts' of the forthcoming generations."" Darwish addressed the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in Ward aqall [Fewer Roses] (1986) and ""Sa-ya'ti barabira akharun"" (""Other Barbarians Will Come"").

Darwish's work has won numerous awards and been published in 20 languages. A central theme in Darwish's poetry is the concept of watan or homeland. The poet Naomi Shihab Nye wrote that Darwish ""is the essential breath of the Palestinian people, the eloquent witness of exile and belonging..."" Among his awards was the ""Cultural Freedom Prize"" by the United States Lannan Foundation, for the stated purpose of recognizing ""people whose extraordinary and courageous work celebrates the human right to freedom of imagination, inquiry, and expression.""

Writing style
Darwish's early writings are in the classical Arabic style. He wrote monorhymed poems adhering to the metrics of traditional Arabic poetry. In the 1970s he began to stray from these precepts and adopted a ""free-verse"" technique that did not abide strictly by classical poetic norms. The quasi-Romantic diction of his early works gave way to a more personal, flexible language, and the slogans and declarative language that characterized his early poetry were replaced by indirect and ostensibly apolitical statements, although politics was never far away.

Literary influences
Darwish was impressed by the Iraqi poets Abd al-Wahhab Al-Bayati and Badr Shakir al-Sayyab. He cited Arthur Rimbaud and Allen Ginsberg as literary influences. Darwish admired the Hebrew poet Yehuda Amichai, but described his poetry as a ""challenge to me, because we write about the same place. He wants to use the landscape and history for his own benefit, based on my destroyed identity. So we have a competition: who is the owner of the language of this land? Who loves it more? Who writes it better?""

Political views towards Israel
Darwish is widely perceived as a Palestinian symbol and a spokesman for Arab opposition to Israel. He rejected accusations of antisemitism: ""The accusation is that I hate Jews. It's not comfortable that they show me as a devil and an enemy of Israel. I am not a lover of Israel, of course. I have no reason to be. But I don't hate Jews."" Darwish wrote in Arabic, and also spoke English, French, and Hebrew.

According to the Israeli author Haim Gouri, who knew him personally, Darwish's Hebrew was excellent. Four volumes of his poetry were translated into Hebrew by Muhammad Hamza Ghaneim: Bed of a Stranger (2000), Why Did You Leave the Horse Alone? (2000), State of Siege (2003), and Mural (2006). Salman Masalha, a bilingual Arabic-Hebrew writer, translated his book Memory for Forgetfulness into Hebrew.

In March 2000, Yossi Sarid, the Israeli education minister, proposed that two of Darwish's poems be included in the Israeli high school curriculum. Prime Minister Ehud Barak rejected the proposal on the grounds that the time ""is not ripe"" to teach Darwish in schools. It has been suggested that the incident had more to do with internal Israeli politics in trying to damage Prime Minister Ehud Barak's government than with poetry. With the death of Darwish, the debate about including his poetry in the Israeli school curriculum was re-opened in 2008.

""Although it is now technically possible for Jewish students to study Darwish, his writing is still banned from Arab schools. The curriculum used in Arab education is one agreed in 1981 by a committee whose sole Jewish member vetoed any works he thought might 'create an ill spirit'.""

Darwish described Hebrew as a ""language of love."" He considered himself to be part of the Jewish civilization that existed in Palestine and hoped for a reconciliation between the Palestinians and the Jews. When this happens, ""the Jew will not be ashamed to find an Arab element in himself, and the Arab will not be ashamed to declare that he incorporates Jewish elements.""

Political activism

Darwish was a member of Rakah, the Israeli communist party, before joining the Palestine Liberation Organization in Beirut. In 1970 he left for Moscow. Later, he moved to Cairo in 1971 where he worked for al-Ahram daily newspaper. In Beirut, in 1973, he edited the monthly Shu'un Filistiniyya (Palestinian Affairs) and worked as a director in the Palestinian Research Center of the PLO and joined the organisation. In the wake of the Lebanon War, Darwish wrote the political poems Qasidat Beirut (1982) and Madih al-zill al'ali (1983). Darwish was elected to the PLO Executive Committee in 1987. In 1988 he wrote a manifesto intended as the Palestinian people's declaration of independence. In 1993, after the Oslo accords, Darwish resigned from the PLO Executive Committee.

Views on the peace process
Darwish consistently demanded a ""tough and fair"" stand in negotiations with Israel.

Despite his criticism of both Israel and the Palestinian leadership, Darwish believed that peace was attainable. ""I do not despair,"" he told the Israeli newspaper Haaretz. ""I am patient and am waiting for a profound revolution in the consciousness of the Israelis. The Arabs are ready to accept a strong Israel with nuclear arms – all it has to do is open the gates of its fortress and make peace.""

1988 poem controversy
In 1988, one of his poems, ""Passers Between the Passing Words,"" was cited in the Knesset by Yitzhak Shamir. Darwish was accused of demanding that the Jews leave Israel, although he claimed he meant the West Bank and Gaza: ""So leave our land/Our shore, our sea/Our wheat, our salt, our wound."" Adel Usta, a specialist on Darwish's poetry, said the poem was misunderstood and mistranslated. Poet and translator Ammiel Alcalay wrote that ""the hysterical overreaction to the poem simply serves as a remarkably accurate litmus test of the Israeli psyche ... (the poem) is an adamant refusal to accept the language of the occupation and the terms under which the land is defined.""

Views on Hamas
In 2005, outdoor music and dance performances in Qalqiliya were suddenly banned by the Hamas-led municipality, with authorities saying that such events were forbidden by Islam. The municipality also prohibited the playing of music in the Qualqiliya zoo. In response, Darwish warned that ""There are Taliban-type elements in our society, and this is a very dangerous sign.""

In July 2007, Darwish returned to Ramallah and visited Haifa for a festive event held in his honor; it was sponsored by Masharaf magazine and the Israeli Hadash party. To a crowd of some 2,000 people who turned out for the event, he expressed his criticism of the Hamas takeover of the Gaza Strip: ""We woke up from a coma to see a monocolored flag (of Hamas) do away with the four-color flag (of Palestine).""

2016 poem controversy
In July 2016 a controversy erupted over the broadcasting of Darwish's poem ""Bitaqat hawiyya"" (""Identity Card"") on Israeli radio station Galei Tzahal. Written in 1964, it includes the lines:

Write down: 
I am an Arab 
Robbed of my ancestors’ vineyards 
And of the land cultivated 
By me and all my children. 
Nothing is left for us and my grandchildren  
Except these rocks… 
Will your government take them too, as reported? 
Therefore, 
Write at the top of page one: 
I do not hate people, 
I do not assault anyone, 
But…if I get hungry, 
I eat the flesh of my usurper. 
Beware…beware…of my hunger, 
And of my anger. 

This enraged Israel defence minister Avigdor Lieberman, who compared the poem to Hitler's Mein Kampf.

Darwish's poems in music and film
Many of Darwish's poems were set to music by Arab composers, among them Marcel Khalife, Reem Kelani, Majida El Roumi and Ahmad Qa'abour. The most notable are ""Rita and the Rifle,"" ""I lost a beautiful dream,"" ""Birds of Galilee"" and ""I Yearn for my Mother's Bread."" They have become anthems for at least two generations of Arabs. In the 1980s, Sabreen, a Palestinian music group in Israel, recorded an album including versions of Darwish's poems ""On Man"" and ""On Wishes.""

The composer Marcel Khalife was accused of blasphemy and insulting religious values, because of his song entitled ""I am Yusuf, oh my father,"" which he based on Darwish's lyrics, and which cited a verse from the Qur'an. In this poem, Darwish shared the pain of Yusuf (Joseph), who was rejected by his brothers and fear him, because he is too handsome and kind. ""Oh my father, I am Yusuf / Oh father, my brothers neither love me nor want me in their midst."" Darwish presents the story of Joseph as an allegory for the rejection of the Palestinians by the Israelis.

Tamar Muskal, an Israeli-American composer, incorporated Darwish's ""I Am From There"" into her composition ""The Yellow Wind,"" which combines a full orchestra, Arabic flute, Arabic and Israeli poetry, and themes from David Grossman's book The Yellow Wind.

In 2002, Swiss composer Klaus Huber completed a large work entitled ""Die Seele muss vom Reittier steigen…"", a chamber music concerto for cello, baritone and countertenor that incorporates Darwish's ""The Soul Must Descend from its Mount and Walk on its Silken Feet.""

In 2008, Mohammed Fairouz set selections from State of Siege to music. In his third symphony Poems and Prayers of 2012, in addition to the lyrics of Mahmoud Darwish, poems by the Arab poet Fadwa Touqan and the Israeli poet Yehuda Amichai are sounded.

In 2011, the Syrian composer Hassan Taha created the musical play ""The Dice Player"", based on the poems and lyrics of Mahmoud Darwish. Their premiere took place at the experimental Center for Contemporary Music Gare du Nord in Basel, Switzerland.

Inspired by the attempted suppression of Khalife's composition ""I am Yusuf, oh my father,"" the Norwegian singer-songwriter Moddi composed a fresh melody to the poem. The song is titled ""Oh my father, I am Joseph,"" from his 2015 album Unsongs.

In 2017, British musician Roger Waters set to music an English translation of Darwish's ""Lesson From the Kama Sutra (Wait for Her)"" on his album Is This the Life We Really Want? in a song titled ""Wait for Her.""

Representation in other media
In 1997, a documentary entitled Mahmoud Darwish was produced by French TV, directed by French-Moroccan director Simone Bitton.

Darwish appeared as himself in Jean-Luc Godard's Notre Musique (2004).

In 2008 Darwish starred in the five-screen film id – Identity of the Soul from Arts Alliance Productions, in which he narrates his poem ""A Soldier Dreams of White Lilies"" along with Ibsen's poem ""Terje Vigen."" Id was his final performance. It premiered in Palestine in October 2008, with audiences of tens of thousands. In 2010, the film was continuing an international screening tour.

In 2009 Egin, a patchanka band from Italy, published a song setting the poem ""Identity Card"" to music.

In 2016, his poem ""We Were Without a Present"" served as the basis for the central song, ""Ya Reit"" by Palestinian rapper Tamer Nafar in the film ""Junction 48"". Additionally, one of his poems was read as part of Nafar's speech during the Ophir Awards.

In 2017, his poem ""Think of Others"" was set to music by a South African artist and 11-year old Palestinian youth activist, Janna Jihad Ayyad.

Death

Mahmoud Darwish died on 9 August 2008 at the age of 67, three days after heart surgery at Memorial Hermann Hospital in Houston, Texas. Before surgery, Darwish had signed a document asking not to be resuscitated in the event of brain death. According to Ibrahim Muhawi, the poet, though suffering from serious heart problems, did not require urgent surgery, and the day set for the operation bore a symbolic resonance. In his Memory for Forgetfulness, Darwish centered the narrative of Israel's invasion of Lebanon and 88-day siege of Beirut on 6 August 1982, which was the anniversary of the bombing of Hiroshima. A new bomb had been deployed, which could collapse and level a 12-storey building by creating a vacuum. Darwish wrote: ""On this day, on the anniversary of the Hiroshima bomb, they are trying out the vacuum bomb on our flesh and the experiment is successful."" By his choice of that day for surgery, Muwahi suggests, Darwish was documenting: ""the nothingness he saw laying ahead for the Palestinian people.""

Early reports of his death in the Arabic press indicated that Darwish had asked in his will to be buried in Palestine. Three locations were originally suggested; his home village of al-Birwa, the neighboring village Jadeida, where some of Darwish's family still resides, or in the West Bank city of Ramallah. Ramallah Mayor Janet Mikhail announced later that Darwish would be buried next to Ramallah's Palace of Culture, at the summit of a hill overlooking Jerusalem on the southwestern outskirts of Ramallah, and a shrine would be erected in his honor. Ahmed Darwish said ""Mahmoud doesn't just belong to a family or a town, but to all the Palestinians, and he should be buried in a place, where all Palestinians can come and visit him.""

Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas declared three days of mourning to honor Darwish and he was accorded the equivalent of a State funeral. A set of four postage stamps commemorating Darwish was issued in August 2008 by the PA.

Arrangements for flying the body in from Texas delayed the funeral for a day. Darwish's body was then flown from Amman, Jordan for the burial in Ramallah. The first eulogy was delivered by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to an orderly gathering of thousands. Several left-wing Knesset members attended the official ceremony; Mohammed Barakeh (Hadash) and Ahmed Tibi (United Arab List-Ta'al) stood with the family, and Dov Khenin (Hadash) and Jamal Zahalka (Balad) were in the hall at the Mukataa. Also present was the former French prime minister and poet Dominique de Villepin. After the ceremony, Darwish's coffin was taken in a cortege at walking pace from the Mukataa to the Palace of Culture, gathering thousands of followers along the way.

On 5 October 2008, the International Literature Festival Berlin held a worldwide reading in memory of Mahmoud Darwish.

Legacy
The Mahmoud Darwish Foundation was established on 4 October 2008 as a Palestinian non-profit foundation that ""seeks to safeguard Mahmoud Darwish's cultural, literary and intellectual legacy."" The foundation administers the annual ""Mahmoud Darwish Award for Creativity"" granted to intellectuals from Palestine and elsewhere. The inaugural winner of the prize, in 2010, was Egyptian novelist Ahdaf Soueif.

7375,['death ( darkness of threat The ?'],"""Domination of Black"" is a poem in Wallace Stevens' Harmonium, first published in 1916 and later (1942) selected by him as his best poem for the anthology This Is My Best.

Interpretation
The poem can be compared to imagist paintings of the period such as Klee's ""Blaue Nacht"", Klee's shades of blue replaced by Stevens' colors of the night. Stevens adds unsettling elements. The poem unfolds like a little horror show. A fire creates flickering images of the colors of bushes and leaves, which themselves turn in the wind. Also the color of heavy hemlocks ""came striding"", as from the river Styx (""the Stygian hemlocks"", in Vendler's phrase). Ambiguous peacocks descend from the hemlocks. Then the poet notices outside his window the planets gathering isomorphically, ""Like the leaves themselves"", and the night came striding. The threat of darkness (death? suicide?) is palpable: ""I felt afraid.""

See also ""Tea"", which, like ""Domination of Black"", demonstrates ""all the troping of leaves through the collection"".

The composer Justin Connolly wrote a piece for solo bass clarinet entitled Tesserae F - ""Domination of Black"". In the published programme note, Connolly describes how the poem ""re-cycles a number of images - hemlock trees laden with snow, the flames of a winter fireside, the harsh cry of peacocks - with the aim of creating by obssessive variation and repetition a scene in which it is the sound itself which provides the sense and sensation of the poem"" adding: ""My music has a similar aim.""

The painter Joan Mitchell named an important work of her's Hemlock (1956) after what she termed ""the dark and blue feeling"" of the poem and its multiple references to the hemlock plant.

7453,"['uses alternative to put are grounds the on buildings other the while itself maintain facility emergency hour - 24 a Can "" asked which study month nine a in resulted request the and "" wing emergency an "" build to prior years four spent been had Money ?']","Greenpoint Hospital (300 Skillman Avenue) opened in 1914 and closed in 1982. As of 2016 final disposition of the hospital site's ten buildings
were still pending.

History
The hospital initially had six buildings. Talk in 1959 of closing part of the hospital pending ""modernization"" and a 1968 ""crash program to remedy decaying conditions"" were part of the hospital's last decades.

At the time of Greenpoint'''s closing, Woodhull Medical and Mental Health Center was deemed to be the community's replacement. Controversy over this matter existed since Woodhull ""was completed in 1978 but stood empty for four years
because the city said it could not afford to operate it."" Even when it opened, it was noted that Woodhull is ""five miles away."" A subsequent study confirmed that ""the amount of time it would take for a vehicle to reach Woodhull from various points in Greenpoint"" averaged ""just under 40 minutes.""

The closing was followed by a series of unkept promises to the neighborhood: instead of a nursing home or senior housing, it became a shelter for homeless men, with the words ""a dumping ground"" used by neighborhood activists, particularly a 1970s-founded group named Neighborhood Women. It took eight years to reduce the number of men in the facility from ""more than 1,100"" to 200. By 2010 the city was still promising to use it for affordable housing. In 2016, although some units had been built, the New York Times summarized the situation as another promise:
""more participants will bring fresh ideas for this valuable city land.""

The hospital had been described as a ""10-building complex"" and many in the neighborhood claimed they ""at least need a substation to keep our people alive in times of emergency."" Money had been spent four years prior to build ""an emergency wing"" and the request resulted in a nine month study which asked ""Can a 24-hour emergency facility maintain itself while the other buildings on the grounds are put to alternative uses?""Greenpoint's closing was followed a year later by that of another neighborhood hospital, Cumberland, both of which were to be ""an exchange"" for over-half-an-hour-away Woodhull'', ""one of the most modern and expensive hospitals in the world."" Another option had been explored in 1964: ""Greenpoint Hospital should be relocated and enlarged, and Kings County Hospital beds should be decreased.""

7813,['what For ?'],"Maria Valeryevna Butina (, sometimes transliterated as Mariya Butina; born November 10, 1988) is a Russian politician, political activist and former entrepreneur who was convicted in 2018 of acting as an unregistered foreign agent of Russia within the United States.

She worked as an assistant for Aleksandr Torshin, a former member of the Federation Council, a member of Vladimir Putin's United Russia party, and a deputy governor of the Central Bank of Russia. In this role, she worked to infiltrate conservative groups in the US, including the National Rifle Association, as part of an effort to promote Russian interests in the 2016 United States presidential election. The Senate Intelligence Committee later concluded that she attempted to persuade the Trump campaign to establish a secret communications back channel with Russia.

In July 2018, while residing in Washington, D.C., Butina was arrested by the FBI and charged with acting as an agent of the Russian Federation ""without prior notification to the Attorney General."" In December 2018, she pleaded guilty to felony charges of conspiracy to act as an unregistered foreign agent of the Russian state under 18 U.S.C. §951. In April 2019, a federal judge sentenced her to 18 months in prison. She served around 5 months at Tallahassee Federal Correctional Institution. Her 9-month pretrial prison term was counted towards her sentence, and she was released in October 2019 and deported back to Russia. She denied accusations that she was a Russian agent. In 2021, she was elected to the State Duma as a member of United Russia.

Early life and education
Butina was born on November 10, 1988, in the Siberian city of Barnaul, in Altai Krai, about  east of the present Kazakhstan–Russia border. Her mother was the chief engineer of an energy enterprise and her father Valery Viktorovich Butin was an entrepreneur who established a furniture manufacturing business in Barnaul. She has one sister and one maternal niece, Kira.

She graduated with honors at the age of 17 from Gymnasium Number 22 with in-depth study of the English language, and from school years she strove for active public activity. She studied political science at Altai State University and also received a teaching degree. At age 19, she was elected to the public council of Altai Krai in the last direct election for the council.

Business and political career
Butina, at age 21, launched a furniture retail business in Altai Krai. In 2011, she moved to Moscow and sold six of her seven furniture stores to start an advertising agency. That same year, she participated in the Youth Primaries organized by the Young Guard of United Russia, the youth wing of the United Russia party, which she has described as ""the current ruling political party in Moscow.""

Further in 2011, Butina founded  (), described as a Russian gun-rights organization. She began traveling back and forth to the US, initially with Aleksandr Torshin, who was then a Senator in the Federation Council of Russia (and a half-month later became Acting Chairman/Speaker of this Senate of Russian Federation) and a leading member of United Russia. He had hired her as his ""special assistant"" that year. In 2012, they lobbied the council to expand gun rights. Butina resigned from her position as the head of Right to Bear Arms in late 2014.

According to Russians interviewed by RFE/RL, the organization was notable for avoiding opposition to Putin during the 2011–2013 Russian protests, for its ""quixotic"" support for a cause with little public support and strong government opposition – Putin himself had told Russians ""I am deeply convinced that the free flow of firearms will bring a great harm and represents a great danger for us"" – for introducing legislation in the Russian parliament that ""never went anywhere"", and for receding from public view after Butina stepped down as its head. According to US prosecutors who prosecuted Butina on charges of conspiracy and acting as a foreign agent, her love of guns was a ruse to advance Russia's agenda within the Republican Party. Anders Åslund described Right to Bear Arms as a ""front organization with the purpose of infiltrating American groups and forging cooperation with the NRA.""

In 2013, she met Republican political operative Paul Erickson in Russia. The two became close, started dating, and eventually moved in together. In 2015, she emailed him a description of a proposed project to influence the Republican Party to be friendlier to Russia, through the NRA. In January 2015, Torshin became deputy governor of the Central Bank of Russia, and Butina worked as his special assistant until May 2017. In 2017, Butina told The Washington Post that she never worked for the Russian government.

In August 2016, she moved to the US on a student visa, and enrolled as a graduate student in International Relations at American University in Washington, D.C. While a student at American University, Butina got drunk on at least two separate occasions and bragged to her fellow students about her contacts in the Russian government; on both occasions, her classmates reported her to law enforcement, sources told CNN.

In February 2016, Butina and Erickson began a South Dakota business, Bridges LLC. Erickson later said the company was established in case Butina needed any monetary assistance for her graduate studies, which Butina commenced in mid-2016 American University in Washington, D.C. In 2018, she completed a master's degree in international relations.

Involvement in U.S. politics

National Rifle Association
As part of her work as a foreign agent, Butina worked to infiltrate the National Rifle Association on behalf of Russia.

Torshin and Butina established a cooperative relationship between the NRA and Right to Bear Arms. Torshin has attended NRA annual meetings in the United States since at least 2011. Following the 2011 meeting, then NRA President David Keene expressed his support for Torshin's ""endeavors"" and extended an invitation to the 2012 meeting. Torshin also attended NRA annual meetings in 2012 and 2013. In November 2013, Keene was a guest at the conference of the Right to Bear Arms in Moscow.

Butina and Torshin attended the 2014 NRA annual meeting as special guests of former NRA president Keene. Butina attended the Women's Leadership Luncheon at the 2014 meeting as a guest of former NRA president Sandy Froman. Butina presented to then NRA president Jim Porter a plaque from Right to Bear Arms. Afterwards, she tweeted ""Mission accomplished"". As Keene's guest, Butina rang the NRA's Liberty Bell, saying, ""To the right to bear arms for citizens of the whole world."" Butina and Torshin also attended the 2015 NRA annual convention.

In 2015, a number of NRA officials attended Right to Bear Arms's annual gun conference in Russia. Among them were Keene, gun manufacturer and NRA first vice president Pete Brownell, conservative American political operative Paul Erickson, and Milwaukee County sheriff David Clarke. One of their hosts was Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin, who in 2014 was sanctioned by the White House following Russia's annexation of Crimea. Clarke's trip cost $40,000, with all expenses paid by the NRA, Pete Brownell (an NRA board member and CEO of a gun-parts supply company) and Right to Bear Arms. According to a disclosure Clarke filed, Right to Bear Arms paid $6,000 to cover his meals, lodging, transportation and other expenses. During the meeting, Clarke met the Russian foreign minister and attended a conference at which Torshin spoke. In November 2016, Torshin tweeted that he and Butina were lifetime NRA members.

Republican Party
Butina has attempted to develop ties to conservative American politics. In a supporting affidavit to the government's support for pre-trial detention following her indictment in United States of America v. Maria Butina, the FBI stated that she had successfully sought ties to the Republican Party, where it is referred to as ""POLITICAL PARTY 1"". According to The Daily Beast, she has presented herself as a ""Russian central bank staffer, a leading gun rights advocate, a 'representative of the Russian Federation,' a Washington, D.C. graduate student, a journalist, and a connection between Team Trump and Russia"" in order to gain access to ""high-level contacts"" in Washington. At the 2014 NRA annual meeting, Butina took pictures with Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal and former U.S. Senator and 2016 presidential candidate Rick Santorum. At the 2015 NRA annual meeting, she met Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, and in July 2015, she was present at the launch of Walker's 2016 presidential campaign.

Obama administration officials
In 2015, Torshin, then the Russian Central Bank deputy governor, and Butina met the Treasury undersecretary for international affairs, Nathan Sheets, to discuss U.S.-Russian economic relations. Separately, they also met with a Federal Reserve vice chairman, Stanley Fischer, and with a State Department official.

Donald Trump campaign
In a June 2015 article published in The National Interest, a conservative American international affairs magazine, just before Trump announced his candidacy for president, she urged better relations between the United States and Russia, saying, ""It may take the election of a Republican to the White House in 2016 to improve relations between the Russian Federation and the United States."" Her biography on the article did not mention that she worked for the Russian government. The next month, Butina attended FreedomFest, where Trump gave a speech, and asked him from the audience about ending U.S. sanctions against Russia, to which he replied, ""I don't think you'd need the sanctions."" Butina hosted a birthday party attended by Erickson and Trump campaign aides shortly after the 2016 election.

Relationships with Trump associates
Butina was in a relationship with Overstock.com CEO and Trump conspiracy theorist Patrick M. Byrne. Byrne claimed the FBI encouraged him to pursue Butina, a claim retired FBI officials denied. In 2019, Byrne divested himself of all shares of Overstock after his relationship with Butina was revealed.

For five years, prosecutors claimed, Butina lived with and maintained an intimate relationship with activist and fraudster Paul Erickson. During Donald Trump's presidential campaign in 2016, Erickson attempted to develop a back-channel between the NRA and the Russian government. Erickson was jailed and convicted of fraud unrelated to his relationship with Butina, then pardoned by Trump in his last week in office.

United States of America v. Mariia Butina, aka Maria Butina

Complaint

On July 15, 2018, Butina was arrested in Washington, and charged with acting in the United States as an agent of a foreign government; specifically the Russian Federation, without prior notification to the Attorney General, a conspiracy to commit an offense against the United States, to wit, 18 U.S.C. §951 (foreign relations, agents of foreign governments), in violation of 18 U.S.C. §371 (conspiracy).

After her arrest, it was mistakenly reported she was charged with a violation of the Foreign Agents Registration Act (22 U.S.C. §11 foreign agents and propaganda). United States law dictates that all lobbyists representing foreign governments must register as such with the Department of Justice. Her attorney said that ""the allegations of the indictment are essentially that her only illegal act was not registering.""

On July 18, Butina pleaded not guilty, and a District Court judge ordered her jailed pending trial. She was also said to be cooperating in a federal fraud investigation in South Dakota. Maria Butina was held in solitary confinement in Alexandria Detention Center.

Affidavit

According to the affidavit in support of the complaint, from as early as 2015 and continuing through at least February 2017, Butina worked at the direction of a high-level official in the Russian government, who, according to The New York Times, was believed to be Torshin. The court filings detail the Russian official's and Butina's efforts for Butina to act as an agent of Russia inside the United States by developing relationships with U.S. persons and infiltrating organizations having influence in the Republican Party and in conservative politics—such as the National Rifle Association, the National Prayer Breakfast and some religious organizations—for the purpose of advancing the interests of the Russian Federation.

The filings also describe certain actions taken by Butina to further this effort during multiple visits from Russia and, later, when she entered and resided in the United States on a student visa. The filings allege that she undertook her activities ""without officially disclosing the fact that she was acting as an agent of Russian government, as required by law.""

Butina, Torshin, and Erickson have been subjects of an investigation by the United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence into Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections. Erickson is referred to in Butina's indictment as ""Person 1."" In addition, George D. O'Neill Jr., a conservative writer and Rockefeller heir, is ""Person 2."" Torshin has also been the subject of a probe by the FBI into whether the Russian government attempted to illegally funnel money to the NRA in order to help Trump win the presidency.

The FBI began to monitor Butina in August 2016, after she had moved to the United States on an F-1 student visa. Rather than confront her immediately, the FBI chose to track her movements and gather information on whom she was meeting, and what her end goals were to be.

Plea deal

Butina's attorneys and federal prosecutors declared in a November 16, 2018, court filing that they had entered into plea negotiations. On December 13, she pleaded guilty to conspiracy to act as an illegal foreign agent, while the original charge of failing to register as a foreign agent was dropped. She faced a maximum sentence of five years in prison and, according to a CNN report, will ""likely be deported after serving any time.""

On April 26, 2019, Butina was sentenced to 18 months in prison by Judge Tanya S. Chutkan, in accordance with the recommendations of prosecutors.

Butina later complained that in the U.S., she was forced to sign a plea-deal. She claimed that she was sentenced for simply being Russian.

Russian reaction
Russian President Vladimir Putin said he had no prior knowledge of Butina. Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov made a statement saying that Butina's arrest was designed to undermine the ""positive results"" of the Helsinki summit between U.S. President Trump and Russian President Putin. She was arrested a day before Trump met his Russian counterpart. Butina's father has called the accusations against her ""a witch-hunt"".

Leonid Slutsky, head of the lower house of the Russian parliament's foreign affairs committee, called Butina's case a ""modern political inquisition."" Russia's Foreign Ministry accused the United States of forcing false confession from Butina. According to the foreign ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, ""having created unbearable conditions for her and threatening her with a long jail sentence, she was literally forced to sign up to absolutely ridiculous charges.""

 Erickson contacts Trump campaign advisor Rick Dearborn. In an email headed ""Kremlin Connection"", Erickson seeks the advice of Dearborn and Sessions about how to arrange a meeting between Trump and Putin. Erickson suggests making contact at the NRA's annual convention in Kentucky. The communication refers to Torshin, who is under instructions to contact the Trump campaign.
 At Butina's urging, Christian activist Rick Clay emails Dearborn with the subject ""Russian backdoor overture and dinner invite"" offering a meeting between Trump and Torshin. Dearborn, then Sessions's Chief of Staff, sends an email mentioning a person from West Virginia seeking to connect Trump campaign members with Putin. Dearborn appears ""skeptical"" of the meeting request. Jared Kushner rejects the request. Torshin and Trump Jr. later meet and speak at the NRA convention.

That night, Erickson emails Butina and Gordon offering to ""add an electronic bridge"" to their meeting at the party. In his email to Butina, Erickson writes that Gordon is ""playing a crucial role in the Trump transition effort and would be an excellent addition to any of the U.S./Russia friendship dinners to occasionally hold."" He writes that all the ""right"" people listen to Gordon on international security.

 December 19: In a Moscow news briefing, Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova says that Butina was coerced into making a false confession: ""Butina confirmed that she had done a deal with U.S. investigators and confessed to being a foreign agent.

Characters

Go Gan (Joe Ma) - Dubbed as the ""Cake God"" for his innovative cake masterpieces. He has a passion for cake-making and rightly possesses a gift known as ""The Freezing Hands"", which refers to his hand temperature being much lower than that of the average man. This enables him to touch and shape chocolate with his bare hands without the chocolate melting. He may look cool and cold on the outside but deep down he is a warm-hearted person. A few years before, he married Ni and fathered his son, Ban. But he was NOT the marrying kind; he just put all his energy and time in his cake-making career and in trying to win cake contests. His wife felt neglected, took Ban with her and walked out on him. He then made a bomb threat at the airport, for which he was jailed for 2 years.  After his release from prison, he was hired by Mr Sa, boss of Gateau cake shop, to become the Chief Cake Chef. Mr Sa had promised to find his wife and son if he worked for Gateau. Life in prison has NEVER dulled his passion and skill for baking cakes. He decides to assume a secret identity -""Cake Robin Hood""- to bake cakes for the less fortunate children. He goes through difficult phases of his life to win back custody of his son and become the best cake chef in the world. He falls in love with Tong Seung but will their relationship ever work out?
Tong Seung (Myolie Wu) - A cheerful, nerdy girl who has a passion for baking cakes but not the skills. In the beginning of the show, she sets up a cake shop to prove to her ex-boyfriend that she could bake cakes. However, she didn't even have the skill to build a proper cake and thus business was poor. The shop was eventually burned down. Tong Seung suspected it was Go Gan who had burned down her shop and thus she joined Gateau as a trainee cake chef for revenge. She posts a message on ""Cake Robin Hood""'s website asking him for a birthday cake for her 25th birthday. She admires ""Cake Robin Hood"" as he sends her another cake telling her not to give up. She eventually becomes the disciple of Go Gan after finding out that he was not the one who set fire to her shop. However, a misunderstanding causes her to hate her Master so much that she challenges him to a duel where they would pit their skills against each other for the title of ""Chief Cake Chef"". She finds it hard to compete against Go Gan as she realises that she had fallen in love with him. Towards the end of the show, she realises that she too had a special skill in making cakes. Her skill was "" Mother's Hand"". A skill that enables her hands to heat up fast enough for her to pull sugar- a technique used by bakers to create objects from sugar. She contracted brain cancer after being struck by lightning,.
Sarah (Annie Man) - Only child of Mr Sa and Young Mistress of Gateau cake enterprises. A strict and spoilt girl who tries her best to prove to her father that she is capable of handling the business.

However, when Go Gan arrives and becomes Chief Cake Chef, she feels that her position as a boss would be affected. She hates Go Gan and finds opportunities to fault him for anything wrong. She conspires with Tang Shuang initially to get rid of Go Gan. However, when Tong Seung backs out of their plans, she is forced to work with the previous Chief Cake Chef of Gateau, Jean Paul. Eventually, she realises the importance of cakes to the business and becomes a trainee at Gateau. Is always seen in the show wearing boots and mini skirts. She is less fortunate than other rich girls as she has to work for her money while the other girls just shop and shop. She does not have bodyguards until later when she employed Yu Jiao unlike the other girls.

Reckless and hot headed, he once set Tong Seung's cake shop on fire. Yu Le becomes a trainee at Gateau but he does not have a passion for cakes not to mention the skills. However, Go Gan always chooses him to be his assistant. He falls in love with Keke but a rival in love enters their relationship and the straining relationship between Tong Seung and Go Gan affects them.
Keke aka Coco (Bobo Chan) - Tong Seung's younger cousin. Her parents divorced and both remarried. Both parents didn't want her even though she had tried her best to fit into 2 new families. As a result, she does not have any confidence in relationships as she fears that it would end up like her parents. Pretty and kind hearted, she has a long line of suitors but she only has eyes for Yu Le. Supervisor of Gateau, she manages the business well and treats her colleagues very well. Her favourite childhood things are 3 treasure rice, 2 flavoured popsicles and woolen objects..
Yu Jiao (Ai Wei) - Good friend of Yu Le and bodyguard of Sarah. He is an ex prison inmate who would do anything to protect Sarah.

Loyal but a bit of a showoff and money lover.
Tong Sam (Gordan Liu) - Father of Tong Seung and owner of Sam Gei Laundry. A caring father who is bald but wears a wig. His wife left him early and thus he was responsible to raise his 2 children. He has always opposes to Tang Shuang being a cake chef and tries his best to make her quit her job to help out at the laundry shop.
Qu Qi (Li Feng) - Mother of Tong Seung. Once the Cake Queen of France but a suicide attempt causes her to lose her memory. She is the original skill master of ""Mother's Hand"".

She has a sleepwalking problem and while she was sleepwalking in Gao Gen's home, she baked very delicious cakes but when she woke up the next day she couldn't remember anything about baking cakes.

Ziegfeld, Florenz Ziegfeld's younger brother. It stars stage actress Florence Reed in her last silent screen portrayal where she plays multiple roles. It is a lost film.

Plot
As summarized in a film publication, when the law closes the Black Panther's (Reed) house, she gives her daughter into the keeping of her old friend Clive (Stephenson). Clive dies and the Cub (Reed), now a young lady, learns who her mother was. Lord Maudsley (Foxe), Clive's son, is in financial difficulty. He makes the Cub believe that dead benefactor has left large debts, and persuades her to reopen her mother's establishment to obtain the money. She does, and the former admirers of the Black Panther marvel at the way she has retained her youth. Eventually the Cub meets her mother (Reed), now an old woman, in a dive to which the Cub has fled with an admirer to get away from the man she loved, but feared to face in her new existence. The place is raided and the mother is shot. Later Maudsley admits that it was he who needed the money, and the lover forgives the Cub and they are happy together.

Reception
One review found the film to be good but complained of a scene where Reed's character was attacked and her bodice was entirely ripped off, saying, what was the use of showing this rather than implying it when the film censors would just cut it?

You About Cares Who Creator a There Is , book 1998 the by supplemented was book The ?']","The Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society produces a significant amount of printed and electronic literature, primarily for use by Jehovah's Witnesses. Their best known publications are the magazines, The Watchtower and Awake!

The Watchtower was first published by Charles Taze Russell, founder of the Bible Student movement, in 1879, followed by the inception of the Watch Tower Society in 1881. Supporters adopted the name Jehovah's witnesses in 1931. Particularly since 2001, when referring to other Watch Tower Society publications their literature has typically stated that it is ""published by Jehovah's Witnesses"", though the edition notice identifies the publisher as the Watch Tower Society.

Along with books and brochures, other media are also produced, including CDs, MP3s and DVDs, and Internet downloads and video streaming. New publications are usually released at Jehovah's Witnesses' annual conventions.

Literature for preaching

Most literature produced by Jehovah's Witnesses is intended for use in their evangelizing work. Publications for preaching are also routinely studied by members, both privately and at their meetings for worship. Their most widely distributed publications are:
 New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures (NWT), a translation of the Bible published in whole or part in over 130 languages. This is the Bible translation primarily used by Jehovah's Witnesses.
 Awake!, published in over 100 languages three times per year, a general-interest monthly magazine covering many topics from a religious perspective.
 The Watchtower Announcing Jehovah's Kingdom, published in 240 languages monthly, focuses mainly on doctrine.

When interested individuals are encountered, Witnesses offer a home Bible study course, using a current publication, such as What Does the Bible Really Teach?, which outlines their primary beliefs and interpretations of the Bible. The Witness then visits the student on a regular basis, generally considering a chapter on each visit. Students are requested to examine the material prior to the arrival of the Bible study conductor, using the questions at the bottom of each page, to ""help prepare the student for the Bible study"". Jehovah's Witnesses customarily read each paragraph aloud together with the student, and then ask the question(s) provided for that paragraph. Students are encouraged to read the scriptures cited in the material. Bible students are expected to be making progress to become baptized as a Jehovah's Witness by the time the course is completed, and may be asked to study a second publication, such as ""Keep Yourselves in God's Love"".

Jehovah's Witnesses previously offered their literature for a price determined by the branch office in each country, to cover printing costs. Since 2000, Jehovah's Witnesses have offered their publications free of charge globally. Printing is funded by voluntary donations from Witnesses and members of the public. Jehovah's Witnesses accept donations if offered by householders, and are instructed to invite donations in countries where soliciting funds is permitted.

Literature for members
Some publications, such as the hymnal Sing to Jehovah, The Watchtower Study Edition, and the textbook Benefit From Theocratic Ministry School Education are for use by those who attend congregation meetings. Others, such as the organizational manual Organized to Do Jehovah's Will and Watchtower Library (containing the Watch Tower Publications Index from 1930, issues of The Watchtower since 1950, and most other Watch Tower Society literature published since 1970), are intended for members. Certain publications are limited to members in appointed positions, such as the manual for congregation elders, ""Shepherd the Flock of God"".

Some publications are typically distributed only to members, but may be supplied to other interested individuals on request or made available in public libraries. These include the Bible encyclopedia Insight on the Scriptures and Jehovah's Witnesses' official history book Jehovah's Witnesses—Proclaimers of God's Kingdom. Many of these publications are also available from their website in the Watchtower Online Library.

Notable publications

In addition to Jehovah's Witnesses' widely distributed magazines, various publications have received attention from the media and other commentators.

Aid to Bible Understanding
Aid to Bible Understanding was the first doctrinal and biblical encyclopedia of Jehovah's Witnesses, published in full in 1971. Raymond Franz, a former member of the Governing Body who left the organization claimed to have been one of the researchers. Research for the book led to new interpretations of some concepts, providing a catalyst for changes in doctrine. It was replaced in 1988 by Insight on the Scriptures, which contains much of the original content from Aid to Bible Understanding.

Life—How Did It Get Here? By Evolution or by Creation?
Life—How Did It Get Here? By Evolution or by Creation?, first published in 1985, presents the Old Earth (Gap and Day-Age) creationism of Jehovah's Witnesses, and their criticism of evolution. Biologist Richard Dawkins criticized the book for repeatedly presenting a choice between intelligent design and chance, rather than natural selection. The book was supplemented by the 1998 book, Is There a Creator Who Cares About You?, and the 2010 brochures The Origin of Life—5 Questions Worth Asking and Was Life Created?

The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life
The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life was a Bible study textbook published in 1968 and revised in 1981 (now out of print). The 1975 Guinness Book of Records included this book in its list of highest printings. According to the Watch Tower Society, by May 1987 publication had reached 106,486,735 copies in 116 languages.

8439,"[""Dance n't Ca Elephants Says Who , V. Louis , Jr. Gerstner ?"", 'Fad a Just \' Empowerment \' W.,""Is Thomas , Malone ?']","Decentralized decision-making is any process where the decision-making authority is distributed throughout a larger group. It also connotes a higher authority given to lower level functionaries, executives, and workers. This can be in any organization of any size, from a governmental authority to a corporation. However, the context in which the term is used is generally that of larger organizations. This distribution of power, in effect, has far-reaching implications for the fields of management, organizational behavior, and government.

The decisions arising from a process of decentralized decision-making are the functional result of group intelligence and crowd wisdom. Decentralized decision-making also contributes to the core knowledge of group intelligence and crowd wisdom, often in a subconscious way a la Carl Jung's collective unconscious.

Decision theory is a method of deductive reasoning based on formal probability and deductive reasoning models. It is also studied in a specialized field of mathematics wherein models are used to help make decisions in all human activities including the sciences and engineering. (See also Game theory, Uncertainty, Expectation maximization principle.)

History 

Decentralization and centralization have been consistent themes throughout history pertaining to governmental authority and political theory. From the rise and fall of the Roman Empire, there have been periods of centralization and decentralization in societies worldwide. Almost any political movement, from the rise of city states in Roman times, to the later rise and downfall of feudal empires during the middle ages, to the rise of fascism in Germany prior to World War II, to the late 20th century formation of the European Economic Union, the history of Europe has been one of cycles of centralization and decentralization.

MIT Professor Thomas W. Malone explains that ""decentralization has three general benefits:

 encourages motivation and creativity
 allows many minds to work simultaneously on the same problem
 accommodates flexibility and individualization

Decentralized decision-making, Malone says, tends to create less rigidity and flatter hierarchies in organizations. When upper management delegates decision-making responsibilities, there also exist wider spans of control among managers, creating a more lateral flow of information. Thus there will be more bottom up directional information flow, allowing for more innovation and efficiency closer to the means of production. This increased flow information thereby allows for innovation in what is called Total quality management.

8489,"['people my unto come shall that evil the see to endure I can how For ?', 'kindred my of destruction the see to endure I can how or ?']","Esther 8 is the eighth chapter of the Book of Esther in the Hebrew Bible or the Old Testament of the Christian Bible, The author of the book is unknown and modern scholars have established that the final stage of the Hebrew text would have been formed by the second century BCE. Chapters 3 to 8 contain the nine scenes that form the complication in the book. This chapter contains the effort to deal with the irreversible decree against the Jews now that Haman is dead and Mordecai is elevated to the position of prime minister.

Text
This chapter was originally written in the Hebrew language and since the 16th century is divided into 17 verses.

Textual witnesses
Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter in Hebrew are of the Masoretic Text, which includes Codex Leningradensis (1008).

There is also a translation into Koine Greek known as the Septuagint, made in the last few centuries BCE. Extant ancient manuscripts of the Septuagint version include Codex Vaticanus (B; B; 4th century), Codex Sinaiticus (S; BHK: S; 4th century), and Codex Alexandrinus (A; A; 5th century).

Esther saves the Jews (8:1–8)
The death of Haman does not change the fact that the irreversible decree to destroy the Jews, written in the king's name and sealed with his ring (), still stands. The king gave Haman's household to Esther and gave Mordecai Haman's signet ring, but he refused to regard it as his problem, even as Esther tearfully begged the king to ""avert the evil design of Haman the Agagite"" (). Thus, Mordecai and Esther together had to come up with a solution, after receiving the king's permission to ""write whatever (they) like about the Jews"" (verse 8).

Verse 1
On that day King Ahasuerus gave to Queen Esther the house of Haman, the enemy of the Jews. And Mordecai came before the king, for Esther had told what he was to her.
The king may see the giving of Haman's house to Esther as suitable compensation because Haman has wronged her in two ways:
 plotting her death, along with the death of her people
 attacking her person in the second banquet.

Verse 2
And the king took off his signet ring, which he had taken from Haman, and gave it to Mordecai.
And Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman.
The second part of verse 2 displays a shift of the focus to Esther, as she is now the one who makes decisions.

Verse 3
Then Esther spoke again to the king and fell down at his feet and begged him with tears to avert the evil of Haman the Agagite, and the scheme that he had devised against the Jews.
The change of tone of Esther's petition before the king indicates her awareness that the gift of Haman's house to her and the signet ring to Mordecai won't do any good after the thirteenth of Adar as long as the decree to annihilate the Jews still stands.
Esther only mentioned Haman as the sole enemy of the Jews (cf. ) and avoided implicating the king in this plot.

Verse 6
For how can I endure to see the evil that shall come unto my people? or how can I endure to see the destruction of my kindred?
Esther used the same two terms — 'people' and 'kindred' as she reversed the act of concealing her identity previously in , when she entered the harem.

Verse 8
Write ye also for the Jews, as it liketh you, in the king's name, and seal it with the king's ring: for the writing which is written in the king's name, and sealed with the king's ring, may no man reverse.
""As it liketh you"": from Hebrew: ""as is good in your eyes.""

Mordecai's balancing act (8:9–17)
The narrative starts with an elaborate description of the system to dispatch the letters conveying the solutions (verses 9–10), then of the content which reveals Mordecai's ingenious ploy: a second decree without contradicting the first one but effectively annulling it by authorizing the Jews to defend themselves against those executing the first decree (verse 11). Both Jews and non-Jews throughout the empire saw the second decree as a bloodless victory for the Jewish cause and the Jews were clearly perceived to have the upper hand that many non-Jews spontaneously converted to Judaism (verse 17).

Verse 9
So the king’s scribes were called at that time, in the third month, which is the month of Sivan, on the twenty-third day; and it was written, according to all that Mordecai commanded, to the Jews, the satraps, the governors, and the princes of the provinces from India to Ethiopia, one hundred and twenty-seven provinces in all, to every province in its own script, to every people in their own language, and to the Jews in their own script and language.
""The month of Sivan, on the twenty-third day"": Two months and ten days since Haman's edict to wipe out the Jews (cf. ).

Verse 11
By these letters the king permitted the Jews who were in every city to gather together and protect their lives—to destroy, kill, and annihilate all the forces of any people or province that would assault them, both little children and women, and to plunder their possessions,

This second edict can be compared and contrasted to the first one as recorded in Esther 3:13:

Verse 15 
And Mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal apparel of blue and white, and with a great crown of gold, and with a garment of fine linen and purple: and the city of Shushan rejoiced and was glad.
""Shushan"": or ""Susa"".

Verse 17
And in every province, and in every city, whithersoever the king's commandment and his decree came, the Jews had joy and gladness, a feast and a good day. And many of the people of the land became Jews; for the fear of the Jews fell upon them.
This verse can be compared and contrasted to Esther 3:15:

8500,['1386 ( Miklós ?'],"Krbava (; ) is a historical region located in Mountainous Croatia and a former Catholic bishopric (1185–1460), precursor of the diocese of Modruš an present Latin titular see.
 
It can be considered either located east of Lika, or indeed as the eastern part of Lika. The town of Udbina is the central settlement of the Krbava karst field, the Krbavsko Polje.

History

Overview

Krbava was one of twelve medieval regions of that later comprised the later Lika-Krbava County. Numerous historical sources, mainly in Latin, referred to toponyms within Krbava, most of which have been correlated with modern-day toponymy.

The most important historical event in Krbava was the Battle of Krbava Field in 1493.

During Croatia in the union with Hungary, nobility were given the title ""of Krbava"" (de Corbauia).

Ecclesiastical history 
 Its capital Udbina became the seat of a Catholic bishopric of Corbavia (Latin = Curiate Italian) / Corbavien(sis) (Latin adjective) when the council of Split (Spalato) in 1185 detached a new suffragan see from the Archdiocese of Spalato (which became its Metropolitan). It comprised the county of Corbavia, part of the county of Lika and the territories of Modruš, Novigrad and Vinodol (Novi Vinodolski, Italian Novi in Valdivino), south-east of Fiume. Pope Urban III approved the erection and the nomination as first bishop of Matteo with the synodal acts. 
 During the 1460s, due to the Ottoman (Turkish) advance in Dalmatia, the diocese of Corbavia was formally suppressed by Pope Pius II, but its territory immediately reassigned to establish as successor see the Diocese of Modruš (Croatian = Curiate Italian) / Modrussa / Modrussen(sis) (Latin), named after its new see, near Fiume (Rijeka), at the rock fortress of the Frankopan counts (now in the comune Josipdol). Again it was a suffragan of the Metropolitan Archdiocese of Spalato (Split).

Lika"
8594,"['to apply law the does individuals Which ?', 'forbidden is touch Which ?']","Negiah (), literally ""touch"", is the concept in Jewish law (Halakha) that forbids or restricts sensual physical contact with a member of the opposite sex except for one's spouse, outside the niddah period, and certain close relatives to whom one is presumed not to have sexual attraction. A person who abides by this halakha is colloquially described as a  (""one observant of "").

The laws of  are typically followed by strict Orthodox Jews, with varying levels of observance. Some Orthodox Jews follow the laws with strict modesty and take measures to avoid accidental contact, such as avoiding sitting next to a member of the opposite sex on a bus, train, airplane, or other similar seating situations. Others are more lenient, only avoiding purposeful contact. Adherents of Conservative and Reform Judaism do not follow these laws. Many Jews with Orthodox beliefs believe that there is extensive room for leniency and that strict adherence to these rules stunts development and prevents social success and ultimately undermines well-being . Others understand the rules as clearly referring to sensual touch.

Biblical prohibition and subsequent exegesis
The prohibition of  is derived from two verses in Leviticus: ""Any man shall not approach (לקרב ) his close relative to uncover nakedness; I am God"" (18:6), and: ""You shall not approach a woman in her time of unclean separation, to uncover her nakedness"" (18:19). The first verse refers to incest, the second to sexual relations with a woman who is in Niddah status due to menstruation. Although the verses speak in the masculine gender, women are equally bound by these commandments.

The Sifra notes that these verses prohibit a man to ""approach... to uncover nakedness"", rather than simply prohibiting the ""uncovering of nakedness"", implying a separate prohibition of ""approaching"" even without sexual intercourse. Based on this, some Rishonim view these verses as also prohibiting sexual touch (such as hugging and kissing) which falls short of sexual intercourse, including Maimonides and the Semag, who note the consideration of whether the contact is done  (דרך [חבה ו]תאוה) in a[n affectionate or] lustful manner. 
However Nachmanides considers the prohibition to be a rabbinic law not derived from scripture, and views the derivation from Leviticus 18:6 as an  (a rabbinic prohibition with a biblical allusion) and not true exegesis.

Which individuals does the law apply to?

The same actions are forbidden with a  and with a forbidden close relative. During the niddah period, even non-affectionate touch between husband and wife is forbidden; however this is commonly referred to as a  (הרחקה, ""distancing"") rather than a case of being .

The laws do not prohibit touching certain close relatives to whom one is expected not to have sexual attraction: children, siblings, grandchildren, parents, and grandparents. Opinions differ on whether one may touch an adopted child of the opposite sex: R' Eliezer Waldenberg and R' Hayim David HaLevi permit, while R' Menachem Mendel Schneerson prohibits. Other authorities offer limited or conditional permission.

Which touch is forbidden?
Maimonides and the Shulchan Aruch formulate this prohibition as ""hugging, kissing, or enjoying close physical contact"". They do not indicate that mere touching is forbidden.

Jonah of Gerona wrote that ""any closeness of flesh is forbidden, for example touching [] the hands of a married woman"".

Regarding the question of whether all affectionate contact is forbidden, or only lustful sexual contact, R' Aharon Lichtenstein ruled that even non-sexual affectionate contact is forbidden. However, R' Yehudah Henkin ruled that only sexual contact is forbidden, at least according to Biblical law.

Incidental, unintended touch is permitted, for example when riding a crowded bus or train.

According to Rabbi Moshe Feinstein, there are two separate laws underlying the concept of . The first law is the prohibition against close contact with forbidden women. Because females above the age of 11 are presumed to have begun menstruation, the  prohibition extends to all females above that age. The second law, called , prohibits causing oneself to have inappropriate sexual thoughts. Feinstein prohibits such acts as hugging, kissing, and holding hands. With regard to shaking hands, see below.

Like most laws, these prohibitions are waived to save a person who is in life-threatening danger, e.g. for a man to save a woman from drowning. In such cases, the prohibitions are waived even if the male rescuer is certain that he will experience improper thoughts (). Furthermore, medical practitioners and other professionals such as hairdressers may touch members of the opposite sex in the course of their professional practice.

Shaking hands 
Whether halacha permits a man to shake a woman's hand (or vice versa) is a matter of dispute.  Opinions range from saying that it is prohibited for a man to return a woman's handshake even if doing so would embarrass him or her, to saying that returning a handshake is permissible to avoid embarrassment but not otherwise, to saying that handshaking is entirely permissible.

Some authorities prohibit returning a handshake, even to avoid embarrassing the other person. These include the Chazon Ish, Yaakov Yisrael Kanievsky, Moshe Stern, Yitzchak Abadi, Sefer Hasidim (who prohibits even when wearing gloves), and Yosef Hayyim.

Rabbi Feinstein gives the benefit of the doubt to those who return a handshake, stating that they apparently hold that doing so is not  (דרך חבה ותאוה), but concludes that such leniency is difficult to rely upon.  Although Feinstein did not address the mitigating factor of preventing the other person from being embarrassed, and fell short of stating outright that returning a handshake is forbidden, it is commonly assumed that R' Moshe prohibits returning a handshake even to avoid embarrassing the other person.  One publication states this in very strong terms. Rav Yaakov Kamenetsky has also suggested that there may be room to be lenient in this situation.

J. Simcha Cohen has been quoted as giving a novel basis for permitting handshaking, based on the Yerushalmi and the ruling of Maimonides. Likewise, Yehuda Henkin holds that it is permissible to shake a woman's hand according to ""the basic halacha"" (the Rambam and Shulchan Aruch), and that those who feel otherwise are stringent.  Hershel Schachter quotes Chaim Berlin as saying that shaking hands with women is strictly speaking () permitted, particularly if to do otherwise would make the Torah look bad, and indicates that he agrees with this position.

According to Fuchs, only German Rabbis have traditionally permitted returning a handshake; and a man who is stringent about shaking hands may be lenient and shake hands with his sister (and vice versa), since we find other leniencies concerning brother and sister.
  
The Career Development Center at Yeshiva University, a Modern Orthodox institution, informs its students that ""Shaking hands is a customary part of the interview process. Halacha permits non-affectionate contact between men and women when necessary. A quick handshake can be assumed to be business protocol. Since failure to shake hands will most likely have a strong negative effect on the outcome, it is necessary non-affectionate contact, which is permissible.""

However, nonetheless, it has been said in the name of prominent Yeshiva University rabbis that one shouldn't engage fully in a handshake, but rather, one shouldn't hold a tight grip.  His hand should be ""helpless"" and as if the other person is initiating and completing the full action, with his hand being the innocent bystander.  Acting as such prevents embarrassment and or loss of a business deal, while at the same time allows one to stay in the framework of halacha (Jewish Law).

Shaking hands and relations with non-practitioners
Menachem Mendel Schneerson wrote that remaining firm in one's convictions when it comes to shaking hands with a woman can engender the respect of the other party.

In contrast, some people view refusal to shake hands with members of the opposite sex as offensive or discourteous, or even sexist. The case of a woman whose offer of a handshake was politely declined by her real estate agent is discussed by 'The 'New York Times ""Ethicist"" Randy Cohen. Orthodox rabbi and law professor Michael Broyde opined that in the case discussed by Cohen, the values of gender equality and of religious freedom are in conflict.

However, others argue that the ""intent [of the practice is] to elevate and sanctify the relationship between men and women, which is all too often trivialized."" They further state that, rather than showing a lack of respect for the opposite gender, the laws of  recognize the inherent sexual attraction between the sexes and the need to avoid viewing members of the opposite gender as objects of sexual desire, except in the marital context.  Moreover, the practice is not discriminatory because ""strictly observant Jewish women also do not touch men, so the prohibition clearly does not confer 'untouchable' status on one sex or another. Rather it proscribes physical contact between the sexes equally.""
Cohen, on the other hand, likens this argument to the ""separate but equal"" status rejected in school desegregation cases.

Other meanings of 

In Jewish civil law, Negiah refers to the halakhic concept of having a vested interest in a dispute.

In popular culture
 In the 2019 short film The Shabbos Goy, Hannah Levy approaches a man who extends his hand for a handshake. She declines by offering her scarf for him to shake instead. 
In the 2017 American teen comedy film F the Prom'', two of the students at the lunch table find out the other is Jewish. The female student stretches her hand out towards the male student (Brendan Calton playing Strings / Efraim), who exclaims that he is  and cannot touch a woman unless she is his wife.

8637,['1526 ( Fernández Juan ?'],"Juan Fernández (1526? at Cordova – 12 June 1567 in Japan) was a Spanish Jesuit lay brother and missionary. He was the first European to write a grammar and lexicon of the Japanese language.

Early life

Fernández was born Juan Fernandez de Oviedo in the Spanish city of Cordoba in 1526.

Before his entry into the Society of Jesus (Jesuits), young Fernández was a Spanish hidalgo and went by the gentry appellation of Juan of Cordoba.  The Francis Xavier biographer, George Schurhammer, S.J. wrote of Fernandez that he was ""a sophisticated young man who he lacked a formal education, but had fine mind"".  He lived in Lisbon, then one of Europe's most flourishing cities, where his brother was a rich merchant who owned a business that sold expensive silks and velvets on the fashionable Rue Novo do Mercadores. By all accounts, Fernández lived a comfortable life as was expected since as a caballero hidalgo, it was necessary for him to abstain from occupations that were considered less than noble. The nature of Spanish social structure was such that the gentry were expected to live life nobly, if they had the means to do so.  Because of the family's wealth, young Juan of Cordoba was able to do just that. However, in his early twenties, these social distinction were about to become meaningless and his life was to turn in another direction.

Conversion
A fateful event changed his life forever when a friend invited him to visit a church to ""hear some excellent music"".  Instead Fernández listened to a fiery sermon by the Jesuit priest, Francisco Estrada, on the Passion of Christ.  Schurhammer describes the scene as being attended by some two hundred of the city’s most prominent men, and, ""[w]hen it was ended, the lights were extinguished and the men in the church began to scourge themselves"".  The ceremony so affected Fernández, that soon thereafter he aspired to religious life and before too long he asked to be admitted to the Society of Jesus, only not as a priest, but as a temporal coadjutor or a lay brother in 1547.

In a January 20, 1548, letter written from Cochin to Simon Rodrigues, Francis Xavier asked that more priests be sent to India and at the same time, described the physical and personal attributes necessary for missionary life in the Far East, writing, ""I also earnestly beseech you for the love and service of God our Lord that when you arrange for the sending of some of the Society who are not preachers to these regions of India to convert the infidels, they be persons who have been well tried in the Society and have had much experience in gaining victories over themselves during the course of some years, and that they not be of poor health, since the labors in India require physical strength, even though spiritual strength is more important."" 
  
Simon Rodrigues must have concluded that the young brother was well suited for missionary work because on September 3, 1548, Brother Fernández arrived in Goa (the capital of the Portuguese India) from Portugal aboard the São Pedro in the company of several of his Jesuit brethren.

Missionary work in Japan
In 1549, Fernández would accompany Francis Xavier and Father Cosme de Torres (1506–1576) on the first Christian mission to Japan which by its very nature was the first substantial cultural exchange between Europe and Japan.

The early Jesuit missionaries arrived in Japan on August 15, 1549, on the Feast of the Assumption and spent their first year in Kagoshima, a port city on the southern tip of the island nation. There the first Japanese Christian community was formed and the Jesuits focused on learning the Japanese language and creating crude Christian books written in Japanese characters that explained basic tenets of Christian doctrine.  The Jesuits moved on from Kagoshima and Xavier planned to convert to Christianity the emperor of Japan, which they hoped would result in a Constantine-style conversion of the entire island nation. Xavier believed also that since the Japanese held reason in high esteem, the Japanese would reason for themselves that to become a Christian would be the correct thing to do. Xavier anticipated that Japan would be the easiest Asian nation to convert. Jesuits missionaries later in the sixteenth century had high hopes that the complete conversion of the Japan would counterbalance the defection of England from the comity of Catholic nations.  However, the mission to the emperor was unsuccessful since he spoke to no one except the most prominent members of Japanese society and instead the Jesuits turned their focus on the individual Christian conversion of the daimyōs, or Japanese warlords.

In a letter from Portuguese Malacca, dated 20 June 1549, Francis Xavier begs the prayers of the Goa brethren for those about to start on the Japanese mission, mentioning among them Juan Fernández. On their arrival in Japan Juan was active in the work of evangelizing.

In September, 1550, he accompanied Francis Xavier to Hirado, thence to Yamaguchi, and on to Kyoto. They returned to Yamaguchi, where he was left with Father Cosme de Torres in charge of the Christians, when Francis Xavier started for China.

There was in the records of the Jesuit college at Coimbra a lengthy document, professed to be the translation of an account rendered to Francis Xavier by Fernández of a controversy with the Japanese on such questions as the nature of God, creation, the nature and immortality of the soul. The success of Brother Fernández on this occasion in refuting his Japanese adversaries resulted in the ill will of Buddhist priests, who stirred up a rebellion against the local daimyō, who had become a Christian. The missionaries were concealed by the wife of one of the nobles until they were able to resume their work of preaching.

Francis Xavier says in one of his letters:

""Joann Fernández though a simple layman, is most useful on account of the fluency of his acquaintance with the Japanese language and of the aptness and clearness with which he translates whatever Father Cosmo suggests to him.""

His humility under pressure impressed all and on one occasion resulted in the conversion of a young Japanese doctor, who later became a Jesuit.

Death and legacy
In 1567, Brother Fernández died in Hirado, eighteen years after his arrival in Japan at the age of forty-one.  Father Cosme de Torres who died in Shiki on the island of Amakusa on October 2, 1570, whom the Xavier biographer, Theodore Maynard, credits with saying of his fellow missionary: ""If Japan has to thank Father Xavier for having brought her the faith, she has to thank Brother Fernández for its conservation after the departure of the saint.""

8701,"['future the of history unwritten the in , you of some for reserved be not may destiny brilliant like a that say shall Who ?']","John White Brockenbrough (December 23, 1806 – February 20, 1877) was a Virginia attorney, law professor, U.S. District Judge of the United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia, and Confederate States congressman and district judge.

Early life and education

Born on December 23, 1806, in Hanover County, Virginia to Judith and William Brockenbrough, both descended from the First Families of Virginia.  Brockenbrough attended  He attended the College of William and Mary from 1824-1825. He then traveled to Winchester Winchester Law School, studying under Henry St. George Tucker Sr. Others studying with Tucker at that time included William L. Goggin and Henry A. Wise. His sister Judith White Brockenbrough McGuire would later write Diary of a Southern Refugee, During the War, By a Lady of Virginia. He was a first cousin of William Henry Brockenbrough.

Career

Brockenbrough was admitted to the Virginia bar and began a private practice in Hanover County until 1834. He served as a commonwealth's attorney for Hanover County. He continued private practice in Rockbridge County, Virginia starting in 1834. He was editor of the Lexington Valley Star in Rockbridge County. In 1837, he published two volumes of reports, containing the decisions of John Marshall's federal circuit court opinions.

Federal judicial service

Brockenbrough was nominated by President James K. Polk on December 23, 1845, to a seat on the United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia vacated by Judge Isaac S. Pennybacker. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on January 14, 1846, and received his commission the same day. His service terminated on May 4, 1861, due to his resignation. He was succeeded by Judge John Jay Jackson Jr.

Other service

Concurrent with his federal judicial service, Brockenbrough was the founder and a Professor of law for Lexington Law School (now the Washington and Lee University School of Law) in Lexington, Virginia from 1849 to 1861. His law students included John J. Davis, John Goode and Robert Murphy Mayo. In his introductory address to the first class of incoming students, Brockenbrough offered this advice:

Sooner or later the occasion will arise when you will appear before the dread tribunal of the public. Let us suppose that the time for the trial of your strength has now arrived. You are called to participate in the management of a cause which excites a profound public interest. A natural curiosity is felt to hear the maiden speech of the young lawyer! People have scarcely yet learned to look upon you as a man. Little is therefore expected of you, but you have had time for preparation, and you have used it well. You have anticipated every possible phase which the case can assume, and you are ready with your authorities to sustain all your positions. The eager crowd closes around you. They listen with surprised delight at the display of your learning and ingenuity, now enraptured with your splendid bursts of indignant eloquence, now melted into pity by some master stroke of touching pathos. With what a greedy ear they drink in those ""words that burn, those thoughts that breathe!"" You sit down overpowered by your own emotion. An audible murmer of approbation runs through that delighted throng! The cause is ended, the victory is won! Clients now pour in upon you, who before had none. You have made a great impression. Your reputation is now established on a firm basis, and the voice of hissing envy shall not retard your onward march. My friends, this is no fancy sketch. We are told by Mr. Butler in his ""Reminiscences,"" that a celebrated English lawyer of the last century had said, that so sudden was his rise at the Bar, that he never knew the difference between having no income at all, and one of £3,000 sterling a year. A single great speech had established his reputation on an imperishable foundation. Who shall say that a like brilliant destiny may not be reserved for some of you, in the unwritten history of the future?

In 1852, Brockenbrough was elected to the board of trustees of what is now Washington and Lee University (then Washington College), which had previously honored him with a Doctor of Laws degree in 1851.

Peace conference

Along with John Tyler, William C. Rives, James Seddon, and George W. Summers, Brockenbrough represented Virginia at the peace conference of 1861.

Civil War

Following his resignation from the federal bench, Brockenbrough became one of Virginia's delegates to the Provisional Congress of the Confederate States from 1861 to 1862. He was a Judge of the Confederate District Court for the Western District of Virginia starting in 1862.

Postwar teaching career

Brockenbrought was a Professor of law for the Washington College Law School (now the Washington and Lee University School of Law) in Lexington from 1866 to 1873. As Rector of Washington College from 1865 to 1872, he was the one to approach Robert E. Lee with the trustees' proposal to make Lee President of the College. In 1866, Lee as President of Washington College invited Brockenbrough to merge his Lexington Law School with Washington College, and continue to teach as Professor of Law and Equity. In 1870, John Randolph Tucker, son of Henry St. George Tucker Sr., was hired to teach law along with Brockenbrough.
In 1868, Brockenbrough was a member of a five-man committee in Lexington which called for ""a White Man's party, based on the single principal [sic] that the white man alone has the right to vote."" Brockenbrough resigned in 1873, in a dispute over salary. He resumed private practice in Lexington from 1873 to 1877.

Personal life

Brockenbrough married Mary C. Bowyer of Lexington, Virginia and they had children.

Death and legacy

Brockenbrough died on February 20, 1877, in Lexington.

8702,"[""Woolf Virginia of Afraid 's Who , Hamlet ' as such plays other various in appeared also has She ?""]","Barbara Marten (born 3 January 1947) is a British actress. She is most known for playing Eve Montgomery in Casualty. She has appeared in various soaps, including Eastenders and Brookside, as well as many other drama serials such as Harry, The Bill and Band of Gold.

Early life
Marten was born in Leeds, West Riding of Yorkshire, and grew up in County Durham. She went to an all-girls school ('William Newton School') in Norton, then Stockton and Billingham Technical College (which has since been demolished). She went to drama school at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art as a teenager for 3 years, and says that it actually put her off becoming an actress. She trained as a teacher in Birmingham and taught for two years before being drawn back to the stage. After becoming involved with a theatre group in Coventry, Marten joined a newly formed theatre group in Doncaster. They toured Yorkshire, performing plays about various subjects, including the St Leger, and another about battered wives.

Career
In 1996, Marten appeared at the National Theatre in Helen Edmundson's adaptation of Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace. She has also appeared in various other plays such as 'Hamlet, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (at Manchester Royal Exchange), The Winter's Tale (at the Royal Exchange), Get Up & Tie Your Fingers (Customs House), The Awkward Squad (West End), Heldenplatz (Arcola), The Enemies Within, Some Kind of Hero (at the Young Vic), The Glass Menagerie (Lyceum, Edinburgh), Everything Is Possible: The York Suffragettes (York Theatre Royal) and a touring production of An Inspector Calls.

From 1997 to 1999 she played the part of nurse 'Eve Montgomery' in Casualty. Since then she has appeared in many TV dramas, receiving much acclaim for her work in dramas such as Bob & Rose and Fat Friends. She played the lead role of Ellen in the British movie Between Two Women (2000), and then in ""A Passionate Woman"" (2010) as Moira. She appeared in the 2012 series Public Enemies.

She then played Hannah Greg in the period television drama series The Mill (between 2013-2014) which was about life at Quarry Bank Mill during the Industrial Revolution.

Barbara and her husband, Mike Kenny, (writer including 'The Railway Children' play) have three sons, Theo, Josh and Billy. She met him in the 1980s, while acting in a student pantomime in Birmingham, when they were studying to become a teachers. They have lived in York since 2004, having previously lived in Leeds. The children have studied at the Steiner School at Fulford.

8727,"['herself death or muse reluctant , lover departed a one awaited the Is ?', 'her to belong hear we voice the Does ?']","Ghost Trio is a television play, written in English by Samuel Beckett. It was written in 1975, taped in October 1976 and the first broadcast was on BBC2 on 17 April 1977 as part of The Lively Arts programme Beckett himself entitled Shades. Donald McWhinnie directed (supervised by Beckett) with Ronald Pickup and Billie Whitelaw. The play's original title was to be Tryst. ""On Beckett’s notebook, the word was crossed out vigorously and the new title Ghost Trio written next to it. On the title page of the BBC script the same handwritten title change can be found, indicating that it must have been corrected at the very last minute.""

It was first published in Journal of Beckett Studies 1 (Winter 1976) and then collected in Ends and Odds (Grove Press, 1976; Faber, 1977).

Its three 'acts' reflect Beethoven's Fifth Piano Trio (Opus 70, #1), known as The Ghost because of the slightly spooky mood of the second movement, Largo. The passages selected by Beckett are from the ""ghostly"" second theme.

Geistertrio, directed by Beckett was recorded by Süddeutscher Rundfunk, Stuttgart in May 1977 with Klaus Herm and Irmgard Först and broadcast 1 November 1977.

The idea for the piece dates back to 1968. At the time, whilst Beckett was working on the French translation of Watt, he had the first glimmerings of an idea for another television play. He discussed this with Josette Hayden who made the following note, which is probably all that remains of the original sketch:

 A man is waiting, reading a newspaper, looking out of the window, etc., seen first at distance, then again in close-up, and the close-up forces a very intense kind of intimacy. His face, gestures, little sounds. Tired of waiting he ends up getting into bed. The close-up enters into the bed. No words or very few. Perhaps just a few murmurs.

Synopsis
Beckett's stage layout is very precise. The setting yet another ""familiar chamber"", as the woman's voice puts it. In the text he includes a detailed diagram, a variation of which is reproduced aside.

Aside from the music, there are other trios at work here: there are three characters, the film is shot from three camera angles (which increase by three shots in each 'act') and the play is broken into three 'acts', each with a meaningful title.

Act I Pre-action

The opening image is a general view of the room, taken from camera position A. After the fade-up we hear a woman's voice addressing the audience directly:

 ""Good evening. Mine is a faint voice. Kindly tune accordingly. [Pause.] Good evening. Mine is a faint voice. Kindly tune accordingly. [Pause.] It will not be raised, nor lowered, whatever happens.""

The woman describes the room: a window, a door, a pallet, which in the BBC production is scarcely more than a mattress on the floor. She neglects to mention the mirror or the stool but she takes time to emphasise that there is no obvious source of light, that everything is illuminated evenly and that everything in the room is grey. ""The play’s lighting seems indeed to be supernatural."" She apologises for stating what must seem obvious and then warns the viewer: ""Keep that sound down.""

The camera cuts to a close-up of the floor, a rectangle 0.7m x 1.5m. It is covered in dust. She tells us that having seen this sample we have effectively seen the whole floor. The exercise is repeated with a section of the wall. There then follow a number of close-ups, of the door, the window and the pallet from above, each a rectangular image although the dimensions vary slightly.

Now aware of the kind of pallet, the kind of window, door, wall and floor we are told to look again at the room as a whole. The camera switches to a general view (A) and moves slowly to position B.

There is a man (F - Figure) ""seated on a stool, bowed forward, face hidden, clutching a small cassette"" recorder, though, at this range, it's not possible to identify it as such until the camera moves to position C and we are presented with a close-up of the man who resembles a ""slumping marionette"". Beckett is very clear about how the camera sees the man:

 ""It [the camera] should not explore, simply look. It stops and stares. […] This staring vision essential to the piece.""

The camera then recedes to A.

There are three instances of music in Act I: when we see each close-up of the door and as the camera moves forward to look at the man and then backwards to its starting position. ""The appearance of the protagonist is thus linked to the entrance of the music with a pathos that strangely contradicts the cold scrutiny of the camera and the emotionally detached tone of the voice."" The music does not emanate from the tape recorder however, it ""exists outside human control, beyond words, outside time, space and the human dimension.""

Act II Action

The bulk of Act II is filmed from position A. The woman's voice advises us, ""He will now think he hears her,"" at which point F turns his head sharply towards the door. It is no one and he resumes his former pose. The next time he puts his cassette down, goes over to the door and listens. He opens it and checks but there is no one there, nor does he see anyone outside through the window. He drifts soundlessly ""through space with no visible propulsion.""

The man goes back over to his pallet, then changes his mind and looks at himself in the mirror. The voice is surprised at this. ""Ah!"" she says; her narration called for him to go to the door. If he can hear her at all, which seems unlikely, she clearly is not in control of him. When he is done the man retrieves his cassette and takes up his opening position. The camera then repeats what it did at the end of Act I, it moves forward from position A to B and then to C where we get a close-up of the man. The camera then retreats as before.

Figure then gets up, goes back to the door and looks out once more. After ten seconds he lets it go and it closes slowly of itself. He goes back to the stool, irresolute.

The voice instructs the music to stop, which it does. After a brief pause she says, ""Repeat.""

There are two instances of music this time, during the camera's repeat of its Act I movements (a recapitulation of the previous theme) and also when he opens the door the second time (which introduces the second subject of the movement).

Act III Re-action

Immediately after Voice asks for a repeat the camera cuts to a close-up of Figure. The music is audible. It moves in closer. The music gets slightly louder and then stops. She does not speak for the rest of the play. ""Act III is embedded in Act II … this time as a mime, without narration but with the camera adopting Figure’s point of view on occasion.""

Again, the man thinks he hears someone and goes to the door. This time we get to see down the corridor; predictably it is empty, grey and ends in darkness. When he goes to the window we get to see outside this time; it is night, rain is falling in the dim light. The camera returns to the pallet and to the mirror which is a small grey rectangle, the same dimensions as the cassette. There is nothing reflected in the mirror at first. When the camera returns we see the man in it. He closes his eyes, opens them and then bows his head. Each of the inspections is interspersed with a God-like view from above.

He returns to his opening position. The music stops and the sound of approaching footsteps is heard. They stop and there is a faint knock on the door. After a pause, another, this time louder. When he opens the door there is a small boy dressed in a black oilskin. The boy shakes his head faintly, pauses, shakes his head again, turns and leaves. In Beckett's production of the play for German television, the boy does not wear oilskins, nor does he turn to go, but backs slowly away down the corridor. Beckett made the same change to his 1976 Schiller Theatre production of Waiting for Godot, having the messenger leave the stage backwards.

Figure stands there cradling the cassette in his arms. The camera backs off and the scene fades out. A significant addition Beckett made to the film was to have ""Figure raise his head, stare into the camera and offer a slight, enigmatic smile"", changing the tone completely from the printed texts, which, like Film, have never been updated. It recalls an earlier play, That Time, where Listener's final smile results from his release from the three narrating voices, endlessly recounting his past. It certainly suggests that the child's negative message held some positive implications for him.

There are three further instances of music here: at the opening, when Figure sits just before the boy's footsteps are heard and after the boys have left and the man is standing there alone.

The music

There are seven excerpts from Beethoven's Piano Trio heard in the play. Beckett indicates precisely where they come in according to the camera movements:

 I.13; beginning bar 47: faint music, for five seconds, the recapitulation of the second motif of the opening subject, the ghostly haunting theme. Music linked to the camera's focus upon the door.
 I.23; beginning bar 49: ""a more dissonant and highly charged version of the motif, with the main rising interval or the melodic line being greater, thus producing greater tension."" Again the music is linked to the door.
 I.31; beginning bar 19: as at I.13, but with piano accompaniment, with crescendo, increasing harmonic tension, rising pitch, and a stretto effect as motifs overlap.

 II.26-29; beginning bar 64: a parallel passage, a recapitulation of that used in I.31-34, but with the stretto effect beginning earlier, and so greater tension
 II.35,36; beginning bar 71: like the previous passage, but with the ""ghostly"" theme overlapping itself, with more movement on the piano part.
 III.1,2,4,5; beginning bar 26: again a recapitulation, the equivalent passage to bar 71; marginally more restful since the rising intervals are all octaves.
 III.29; beginning bar 64: the same music as II.26, but this time the footsteps are heard and the boy appears.
 III.36; beginning bar 82: the music grows as the camera moves in; this is the coda, the end of the movement.

Interpretation

In a letter dating from January 1976, Beckett wrote of a first draft of a television play in which all of the motifs from his œuvre had returned: ""All the old ghosts. Godot and Eh Joe over infinity. Only remains to bring it to life."" Biographer James Knowlson observes that on ""the first typescript of 'Tryst', Beckett wrote in by hand the word 'Macbeth'. When I asked him directly what he meant by this note, he explained that the record sleeve of his own recording (the version made by Daniel Barenboim) linked this Piano Trio with Beethoven’s music for an opera based on Macbeth [...] 'The Ghost' retained for Beckett something of Macbeth’s doom laden atmosphere and involvement in the spirit world.""

""Krapp's Last Tape and Ghost Trio,"" observes Graley Herren, ""are not customarily thought of together; at first sight, the two plays do indeed appear to be quite different. Yet, on closer look, it is perhaps more puzzling why the two are not considered more alike. Both focus upon a man alone in his room thinking about a long lost other. Both men are prompted into deeper meditation by audio-recordings. Both are occasionally distracted away from their respective tapes, which stop and start several times. But each man eventually returns to his intent pose, crouching protectively, even lovingly, over the indispensable instrument of his reverie.""

There are many other motifs within the play that recall other works, none less than the appearance of the boy who may be saying, similar to the boys in Godot,  ""'She' will not come today, but surely tomorrow.""

On the surface the boy could simply be a go-between but, with the changes Beckett made – removing the oilskin and having the boy back away – it would appear that Beckett is looking to add significance to his small role. ""It is almost as though the boy were F’s youth, coming to tell him he has not yet reached the end of his course and backing away into his past."" This interpretation is given weight by James Knowlson who suggests that ""the man [is] perhaps about to die;"" it may be that all he has been waiting on is the news that his beloved is not coming so he can let go. Perhaps this is what is intimated by the added smile. It has been noted too that, in the BBC version, the corridor surrounding the boy ""resembles a coffin.""

Is the awaited one a departed lover, reluctant muse or death herself? Does the voice we hear belong to her? Presumably, she is deceased. It has even been suggested that the boy is ""the ghost of the perhaps-unborn child"" of the man's relationship with the woman. The specifics are unclear but the mood is.

As with the radio play Words and Music, the role of Beethoven's music in this piece is to reflect the emotions of Figure and ""his yearning for 'her'. His thoughts persistently return to the Largo and the intensity of his feeling is expressed by the music's increases in volume. In a sense 'she' is the music. It expresses her presence in Figure's consciousness in much the same way as Croak urged both Words and Music to express his memory of 'the face on the stairs.'""

Opinions differ greatly over the work and most critics tend to concentrate on descriptions rather than meanings, in fact, Beckett's biographer and long-time friend, James Knowlson, goes as far as to admit that ""no significant meaning can be abstracted"" from the piece. At the same time it has also been called, ""one of Beckett’s miniature masterpieces.""

On the Marionette Theatre

Puppets have been a source of interest to Beckett going back as far as the story, Love and Lethe, however, the most famous quote is from Murphy: ""all the puppets in this book whinge sooner or later, except Murphy, who is not a puppet.""

Beckett had been very impressed by Heinrich von Kleist's 1810 essay, Über das Marionettentheatre (On the Marionette Theatre) and his admiration was evidenced when he was rehearsing with Ronald Pickup for the BBC recording of Ghost Trio. Kleist envisioned the marionette as sublime, transcending not only the limits and flaws of the human body, but of the weight of self-consciousness. Self-awareness, he maintained, bred affectation, which destroys natural grace and charm in man. ""Man is, therefore, a creature permanently off balance. He lacks the unity, harmony, symmetry and grace that characterizes the puppet.""

""In Ghost Trio … the male figure (F) acts as if he were virtually a puppet, turning his head sharply whenever he thinks 'he hears her' and moving around the room, as if he were being controlled by the woman's voice, which issues what are, ambiguously, either commands or, more likely, anticipations of actions. The movements of his hand, as he pushes open the door or the window, and the movements of his head, as he bows it in front of the mirror, are all slow, deliberate, highly economical, and extremely graceful."" Beckett's aim ""was to achieve a musicality of gesture as striking as that of voice."" His argument was ""that precision and economy would produce the maximum of grace."" and it was this aspect of Kleist's argument Beckett was using as the basis of his drama.

The figure in the room is somewhere betwixt marionette and man, however, ""one sustained, economical and flowing, the other abrupt and jerky … poised midway between two worlds … in spite of everything, a creature bound to a world of matter, not quite the still-life figure that at moments he appears to be. Nor is he totally free of self-consciousness, as his look in the mirror indicates, or wholly indifferent to the world of the non-self.""

Me Like Guy Nice A Does Why ?']","Randall Allen Terry (born 1959) is an American activist and political candidate. Terry founded the anti-abortion organization Operation Rescue, which he later abandoned. Beginning in 1987, the group became particularly prominent for blockading the entrances to abortion clinics; Terry led the group until 1991. He has been arrested more than 40 times, including for violating a no-trespass order from the University of Notre Dame in order to protest against a visit by President Barack Obama.

In 2003, Terry founded the Society for Truth and Justice and conducted a program which he called Operation Witness. In 1998, he ran for Congress in Upstate New York, and in 2006, he ran for a seat in the Florida State Senate, both times, he lost in the Republican primary.

Career as an activist
In 1986, Terry was arrested for the first time for chaining himself to a sink at an abortion clinic. Terry was frequently in the news because of his activities as the leader of Operation Rescue.

Terry was named as a co-defendant in the 1994 Supreme Court case, NOW v. Scheidler, a class-action suit to compel anti-abortion leaders to compensate clinics for loss of business. Terry settled out of court with the National Organization for Women. Rather than pay the settlement, Terry promptly filed for bankruptcy, prompting Senator Charles Schumer to propose an amendment to a bankruptcy bill in Congress which would ""specifically ... prevent abortion opponents from using the bankruptcy code to avoid paying court fines."" The amendment was not included in the final bill. In 1998, NOW obtained more than 25,000 ""frequent flyer miles"" which were held by Terry in order to help satisfy a legal judgment.

In 1990, Terry helped to organize protests outside the hospital where Nancy Cruzan was a patient, around the time when her feeding tube was removed. The group Missouri Citizens for Life was also involved in the protests, along with the Rev. Patrick Mahoney, a former Operation Rescue staffer. He was also involved in protests which were related to the Terri Schiavo case. In 1994, Terry was a named defendant in Madsen v. Women's Health Center Inc. which ultimately made it all the way to the US Supreme Court. The Justices sided with Aware Woman Clinic and upheld a Buffer Zone. In 1998, Randall Terry ran for the United States House of Representatives in Upstate New York. Terry competed with radio station owner William ""Bud"" Walker for the Republican nomination to face Democratic incumbent Maurice Hinchey. Terry received the endorsement of Focus on the Family head James Dobson; however, national and state Republicans were not supportive of Terry's candidacy. Terry was defeated by Walker 53% to 35%, but he was the Right to Life Party's nominee in the general election. Terry came in third place, winning 7% of the vote, with Hinchey and Walker winning 62% and 31% respectively. In 2000, Terry and his son Jamiel promoted the candidacy of Steven Forbes in the Republican presidential primary. In June 2005, Terry announced plans to run in the primary against Florida Republican state senator James E. King, citing King's attempt to block legislation which would have kept Terri Schiavo alive. In August 2006, in an attempt to undermine King's support in a Republican primary the next month, Terry publicized an endorsement of King by ""Bill Clinton"" — actually, robo-calls by a professional impersonator of former president Bill Clinton. The two ""Clinton"" scripts each contained a disclaimer. One was, ""Hello friend, Bill Clinton here – not really!"" The other was ""This is a celebrity impersonation."" Terry used the scripts and the impersonator in 43,000 calls. The ""no amnesty"" line was a reference to immigration reform proposals which were an issue in many campaigns in 2006. On September 5, 2006, Terry was defeated in the primary, with King receiving over two-thirds of the votes which were cast.

On March 20, 2009, the White House announced that President Barack Obama was going to speak at the May 17 Commencement of the University of Notre Dame. Terry declared that Notre Dame, which is one of the foremost Catholic universities in the nation, should not have allowed Obama to speak. Terry objected to Obama's speech because Obama supports abortion rights. In an article which was published in the University's newspaper, The Observer, Terry was quoted as stating that he planned to turn the commencement into ""a circus."" On the Notre Dame campus on May 1, 2009, Terry was arrested for violating a no-trespassing order. He posted a bond of $250 at the St. Joseph County Jail, was released that same day, and was assigned a court date later that month. In a statement which he released to a Christian news service, Terry claimed that Notre Dame's invitation to Obama was a betrayal of Catholic teaching, comparing it to Judas' betrayal of Jesus Christ.

When Kansas obstetrician George Tiller was murdered while he was serving as an usher in his Wichita church on the morning of May 31, 2009, Terry immediately issued a statement in which he denounced Tiller. On the same day, June 1, Terry released a video in which he called president Barack Obama and pro-choice politicians ""child killers"", and he also stated that Tiller was a ""mass murderer"" who ""reaped what he sowed."" He voiced regret that Tiller wasn't able to ""get things right with his maker"" and he also stated that it was unfortunate that Tiller didn't get a ""trial of a jury of his peers and to have a proper execution."" Terry's comments provoked a backlash. In an editorial, the Albany Times-Union, accused Terry of undermining the credibility of the ""generally peaceful"" anti-abortion movement.

In 2013, Terry appeared on an episode of MTV's True Life and during his appearance on the show, he advocated the criminalization of all forms of birth control. During the course of the episode he stated, ""Do we want to make the pill illegal? Yes. Do we want to make the IUD illegal? Yes. The morning after pill? Yes. The patch? Yes. Anything that's a human pesticide, they all have to be made illegal. A woman has to go to jail if she kills her baby.""

Terry produces and hosts a television program which is titled Randall Terry: The Voice of Resistance, which airs on The Walk TV and can be seen on his website ""Voice of Resistance"".

2012 presidential candidacy

In January 2011, Terry announced his intention to challenge President Barack Obama in the Democratic Party primaries for the presidential election of 2012. His campaign strategy was based upon a commercial during Super Bowl XLVI featuring graphic photographs of aborted fetuses; historically, the networks have refused all political and issue-related advertising during the Super Bowl, citing equal-time rules, and the advertisement did not air.

The attempt to air the ads led to legal action and a statement by the Democratic National Committee that Terry was not a legitimate candidate, and thus should be forbidden privileges given others running.

In December 2011, he became the physical target of candidate Vermin Supreme, who sprinkled glitter over his head during a debate claiming he was turning Randall homosexual for a period of time.

According to unofficial results, Terry received 18% of the vote in the 2012 Democratic Oklahoma Presidential Primary. He also won 12 counties in the state, including the entire panhandle, and was awarded two delegates in the Democratic Primary. Kansas TV station KDGL-LD channel 23, is an Independent TV station serving Southwest Kansas and the Oklahoma Panhandle. It and its sister stations carry Randall's Walk TV program, broadcasting the length of the Panhandle. It was the only primary in which Terry won any counties or delegates. He had also appeared on the ballots in Alaska, Missouri, and New Hampshire.

2012 congressional candidacy
Although he lives in West Virginia, Terry paid his filing fee and ran as an independent candidate for Congress in Florida's 20th District. Incumbent Democrat Alcee Hastings won that election with 88% of the vote on November 6, 2012.

Personal life
Terry's personal life has frequently come under public scrutiny, some of which he has welcomed, going so far as to put his foster children on his curriculum vitae as part of his anti-abortion ""bona fides"". Terry has been married twice, and he has fathered children during both of his marriages. With his first wife Cindy, he had a daughter and then he fostered two additional daughters and a son. He adopted the two youngest foster children. He has four sons with his second wife, Andrea.

The son of public school teachers, Terry was raised in Rochester, New York. After dropping out of high school, hitch-hiking around the United States, and returning home to work in various jobs, he attended Elim Bible Institute, graduating in 1981. In the early 1980s, Terry married Cindy Dean, a woman who he had met in Bible school. In 1985, he met a woman who had borne her second child in prison and was planning to have an abortion rather than have a third child. Terry persuaded her to continue with the pregnancy and a daughter named Tila was born later that year. In 1987, Cindy and Randall Terry had a daughter together, whom they named Faith. In March 1988, they took in Tila, then aged three, and her siblings Jamiel, 8, and Ebony, 12, as foster children. All three of them are biracial; their mother was white. Terry formally adopted the two younger children in 1994 and on his résumé, he began to describe his family as: ""Children: One by birth and three black foster children,"" although Ebony had left home at the age of 16 in 1991. Ebony, who was not adopted by Terry, uses the surname Whetstone, but Jamiel and Tila took and retained the surname Terry. She converted to Islam, a religion which Terry has preached is composed of ""murderers"" and ""terrorists."" In 2004, Terry described his relationship with Ebony as ""good."" However, Terry banned Tila from his home after she became pregnant outside of marriage twice by the age of 18; her first pregnancy ended in a miscarriage.
In 1998, when Terry was accused of advocating racism while he was running for Congress, his son Jamiel stepped forward to defend him. In 2000, Jamiel worked with his father on Steven Forbes' campaign for the Republican nomination for U.S. president, and he campaigned with his father against gay marriage in Vermont. In 2004, Jamiel publicly announced that he is gay and he also wrote an article for Out Magazine, for which he was paid US$2,500. When he learned that the Out article was going to be published, Terry pre-empted Jamiel by writing an essay, ""My Prodigal Son, the Homosexual"", in which he writes of pain and disappointment, blames Jamiel's homosexuality and his other troubles on his childhood experiences, and contends that much of the Out Magazine article is false and was written by other people. Jamiel's response was, ""My father's first and foremost aim is to protect himself. He talks about how I prostitute the family's name, but he's used the fact that he saved my sister from abortion and rescued me from hardship in his speeches and interviews. What's the difference?""

In 2000, Terry divorced Cindy Dean, his wife of 19 years,  and married his former church assistant, Andrea Sue Kollmorgen. Kollmorgen, born c. 1976, was approximately 25 years old at the time of their nuptials; As a consequence of the divorce, the home on  where he had lived with Cindy and their four children was going to be sold. In 2000, some in the press unfavorably compared his decision to divorce Cindy Dean and marry Kollmorgen to the opinion which he expressed in his 1995 book, The Judgment of God: ""Families are destroyed as a father vents his mid-life crisis by abandoning his wife for a 'younger, prettier model.' "" His sentiments against divorce had been so strong that when his own parents got divorced, ""Randall refused to let his children speak with their grandfather for three years,"" according to interviews which were conducted with the family by the Washington Post. As a result of Terry's divorce from Cindy Dean, the pastor of the Landmark Church of Binghamton, New York, ""unceremoniously tossed him out"" although Terry had been a member there for 15 years. That church had previously censured him because he had abandoned his wife and the two children while they were still living at home in preparation for divorce, and it also censured him by claiming that he was engaging in a ""pattern of repeated and sinful relationships and conversations with both single and married women."" After the censure and expulsion, Terry joined the Charismatic Episcopal Church, a denomination which was established in 1992. After a period of study which commenced in 2005, Terry formally converted to Roman Catholicism in 2006, taking the confirmation name ""David Mark."" After his conversion, he disavowed his first marriage and divorce, saying, ""There were tragic problems that were inherent to the marriage. According to Catholic doctrine as it has been taught to me, those problems made it an invalid sacrament.""

In 2004, the Washington Post reported that Terry and Cindy's daughter was in college. Five years into his second marriage, a 2006 article in the National Catholic Register described his current family as ""his three, soon to be four, rambunctious young boys."" Terry's second wife, Andrea, is also an anti-abortion activist and in 2008, she was arrested for trespassing while she was leafleting a Roman Catholic cathedral parking lot with campaign fliers for a fictitious candidate who was advocating the enslavement of African-Americans. Randall Terry stated, ""The piece was intended to be incendiary and basically a satire,"" a protest against vehicles in the church parking lot which, he said, carried bumper stickers supporting pro-choice political candidates, particularly Rudy Giuliani.

Terry's son Jamiel was killed in an automobile accident in November 2011. They had reportedly reconciled prior to Jamiel's death.

In 2012, Terry moved his growing family to Romney, West Virginia, to focus on his campaign.

Synopsis
The album consists of two 28-minute pieces, each taking up one side of the original vinyl release.

""How Can You Be in Two Places at Once When You're Not Anywhere at All"" 
This opens with a late-night TV commercial by car salesman Ralph Spoilsport (Philip Proctor), a spoof of Southern California Ford dealer Ralph Williams. As he extols the virtues of a featured new car, the main character Babe (Peter Bergman), runs across traffic onto the lot and interrupts Ralph's spiel with an immediate desire to buy the car in question. Ralph enthusiastically invites Babe to take a look inside his ""beautiful new home"". The impossibly luxurious car contains a ""home entertainment system"", with AM and FM radio and television. Spoilsport turns on each component in turn, creating a cacophonous din.

Babe buys the car and, as he drives it, the text of road signs and billboards along the road is spoken as he passes them. He decides to take the Antelope Freeway, and the distance signs to it progress per Zeno's paradox (one mile, 1/2 mile, 1/4 mile, etc.) The infinite series is broken only when he decides to try the ""all-weather climate control"", and selects ""tropical paradise"" from a list of options. At the push of a button, this transforms the interior of his car into a tropical rainforest, complete with sounds of exotic birds, thunder, and rainfall.

A troupe of wise-cracking explorers emerge from the trees, including someone who sounds like W. C. Fields, on a half-hearted expedition. Babe tries to escape the interlopers by changing the climate control to ""Land of the Pharaohs"" and is transported to ancient Egypt, but to no avail; the explorers have come with him. Increasingly annoyed, he complains that the sun is setting and it will be night soon. They reply he's confused, the horizon is moving up; so they stand him on his head to convince him that it is morning. Babe loses his balance and falls to the ground, causing one to remark, ""He's no fun! He fell right over!"". A loud rumbling is heard, and the group realizes that a pyramid is opening.

The pyramid is actually a motel, with a vacancy. Babe enters the lobby and encounters a pair of partiers. They  gradually morph into panoply of characters who launch a satirical celebration of America which parodies Norman Corwin's 1941 patriotic radio pageant We Hold These Truths. This includes sardonic references to slavery and the conquest of the American Indians. At one point, each member of the group rhythmically repeats the names of the candidates in the 1968 presidential election mimicking a steam locomotive: ""Rockefeller, Nixon, Humphrey, and Kennedy.""

Eventually, Babe is drafted into the army, and the play morphs again into the closing scene of a World War II musical film ""Babes In Khaki"", starring Lillie Lamont (Proctor). The movie is broadcast on  television, and after it ends, channel surfing reveals snippets of random commercials and program segments. At one point we hear a crime drama, with tough guys saying they hate cops. One named Nick declares he's ""gonna get even with every rotten cop in this city"", by turning in his badge and burning his uniform.

Finally, Spoilsport returns as ""Ralph Icebag"", selling marijuana instead of cars. His spiel morphs into a close paraphrase of Molly Bloom's Soliloquy which closes James Joyce's novel Ulysses.

""The Further Adventures of Nick Danger"" 
This is presented as an episode (titled ""Cut 'Em Off at the Past"") of a fictional 1940s radio drama, Nick Danger, Third Eye, broadcast on December 7, 1941. Nick Danger (Phil Austin) is a '40s-style hardboiled private investigator in the Raymond Chandler mold. In live performances and photographs, he wears the stereotypical fedora and trench coat. He has the obligatory nemesis on the police force, Lieutenant Bradshaw (Bergman), who questions Danger's every move. His ""mark"" is Rocky Rococo (Proctor), a Peter Lorre parody. True to the clichés of the genre, there is a suspicious butler, Catherwood (David Ossman), and a femme fatale: Danger's old college flame Betty Jo Bialosky (Proctor, or Bergman in scenes with Rocky Rococo), with aliases Melanie Haber, Audrey Farber, and Susan Underhill, whom ""everyone knew as Nancy"" (parodying a line from the Beatles' song ""Rocky Raccoon"").

This sketch is not as surreal or Kafkaesque as most other Firesign Theatre material, though it is intermixed and loaded with references to the Beatles, the I Ching, and other counterculture topics.  The basic plot involves the attempt by Rococo to sell Danger a stolen ring, that belonged to Nancy; Danger is thus drawn into a trap and framed when Nancy and Catherwood kill Rococo because he found out about time travel experiments by Catherwood, leading Danger to a violent confrontation with all of them and forcing a confession from Catherwood at gunpoint.  It also parodies characteristics of old-time radio drama production, e.g. referring to a fireplace fire as ""the cellophane"" and ""coming in out of the cornstarch"" (used to create the sound effects); actors reading the wrong lines, or dropping their scripts; actors stepping out of character to read commercials; and referring to the use of voice fade-outs and organ cues to signal transitions between flashbacks.

At one point, Nancy faints and falls over, causing Danger to say, ""She's no fun, she fell right over."" He remembers he (Austin) said this same line on side 1 of the record, and asks, ""Where am I? I'd better check."" The side 1 track is then heard playing backwards, and Danger says, ""It's OK, they're speaking Chinese"" and continues with the play.

The climax is reached as Catherwood's return from a flashback is bungled, resulting in the duplication of every character except Lieutenant Bradshaw. Just as Danger is about to try something daring to solve this problem and extricate himself from his trap, the action is abruptly interrupted by a special news bulletin, in which President Franklin Delano Roosevelt (Bergman) wearily tells the American people of the attack on Pearl Harbor. He declares our ""rendezvous with destiny"" demands the United States ""unconditionally surrender"" to the Empire of Japan. The bulletin ends, but it is too late to find out what Danger did; Bradshaw is congratulating him for solving the case.

The closing organ theme chord segues into Austin laughing and singing ""ta-da!"", and the Firesign Theatre talk to the producer, announcing their intent to ""go back to the other side of the record"". The producer then announces, ""Scene 3, take 600"".

Artwork
The front cover of the album features photographs of Groucho Marx and John Lennon framed by faux Cyrillic lettering, ""ДLL НДІL МДЯЖ LЄИИФИ"". Because of this, the album is sometimes erroneously referred to as All Hail Мarx and Lennon.

The back cover is an overhead shot of the four members looking up at the camera, with Proctor standing on Austin's foot.

Inside the gatefold of the album there are eight posed photos representing various scenes from ""The Further Adventures of Nick Danger.""

In popular culture
There are several bars in the United States named ""Nick Danger's"".  There is a clothing line called ""Nick Danger"", as well as a garage band, a porn star, a site about board games (now defunct), and a radio DJ all using the name.  ""Rocky Rococo"" is the name of a pizza-and-pasta restaurant chain based in Wisconsin, and there is a ""Betty Jo Byoloski's"" (sic) bar and grill in downtown Winona, Minnesota.

The line ""He's no fun, he fell right over"" is used as a quip in the Mystery Science Theater 3000 episode ""Hercules Unchained"" for the film Hercules Unchained.

8992,"['tu e parole mie Le "" example for see ( hand of images the on cursive rapid in written words using began then She ?']","Ketty La Rocca (14 July 1938 – 7 February 1976) was an Italian artist during the 1960s and 70s. She was a leading exponent of body art and visual poetry movements.

Nowadays, The Estate Ketty La Rocca is managed by her son, Michelangelo Vasta, Professor of Economic History at the Department of Economics and Statistics, University of Siena.

Work
The art of La Rocca comprises visual poetry, visual art, and performance. She explored language, images, and scenes of the everyday world. She emphasized the imagery of bodies.

Beginning in the 1970s she mounted an extensive study of the human hand. She examined their potential for expression. She combined hands and words. She desired to create a different language, a more visceral communion in which the physical body, gestures and the written word were intertwined. In connection with these works La Rocca made specific reference to the female life experience, which had only ascribed certain activities to women’s hands. In 1974, she wrote from a feminist perspective: “For women today is not a time of explanations. They have a lot to do and then they only have one language at their disposal, which is alien and inimical to them. They are robbed of everything, except of the things that no one notices and those are manifold, even if they must be arranged. Hands, for instance, too slow for female skills, too poor and too incapable of continuing to hoard. It is better to embroider with words...“

Near the end of her career La Rocca worked in ""Riduzioni"" (reductions), in which she transforms a common photograph, such as a family or individual portrait, into something more graphic. She alters the picture using graphic contouring of the image or by other distortions, often involving written words.

La Rocca debuted in the early 1960s as a poet, and eventually combined her poetic sense with the visual sense. Beside the experience with concrete poetry, she produced, in line with the visual poetry of Gruppo 70, to which she belonged, her collages, a set of images and words taken from newspapers and magazines and recombined in critical forms.

Starting from the late 1960s and early 1970s, she examined the universe of communication, using innovations including videotapes, installation and performance. During this time she created several works in black PVC plastic, often reproducing single letters of the alphabet and punctuation marks (mainly the comma), and various objects in metal and mirror.

After that time La Rocca developed the idea of a body-language, or of a body turned into language. She used pictures of human hands making simple gestures. Her initial steps during this phase included her book ""In principio erat"" (1971), which Lea Vergine cited as one of the fundamental experiences of Italian body art; and La Rocca's video “Appendice per una supplica”, shown for the first time at the 1972 Biennale di Venezia.

She then began using words written in rapid cursive on the images of hand (see for example ""Le mie parole e tu?"", 1971). This was the common trait of two main series produced by Ketty La Rocca in the last years of her life: the ""riduzioni"" and the ""craniologie"". In the former works, she developed her signature body of work, and passage after passage, with a gradual transfiguration, the images dissolve — through the act of writing — to the point where they become pure abstraction. In the ""craniologie"" she used the word ""you"", written on the reproductions of x-rays of her skull, where the image of a hand or a finger was superimposed on the cranial cavity. La Rocca constructed her unique aesthetic language working with materials as different as the letters of the alphabet, hand gestures, x-rays of her own head, and the practice of automatic writing.

La Rocca died of brain cancer in 1976 at the age of 37. After her death, La Rocca's works have gained international notice. Several retrospectives have been organized in Italy, Europe and the United States, in public and private spaces, such as:

9073,"['First on \'s Who "" \'s Jaffe A. David ?']","The double bass, also known simply as the bass (or by other names), is the largest and lowest-pitched bowed (or plucked) string instrument in the modern symphony orchestra (excluding unorthodox additions such as the octobass). Similar in structure to the cello, it has four, although occasionally five, strings.

The bass is a standard member of the orchestra's string section, along with violins, viola, and cello,  as well as the concert band, and is featured in concertos, solo, and chamber music in Western classical music. The bass is used in a range of other genres, such as jazz, 1950s-style blues and rock and roll, rockabilly, psychobilly, traditional country music, bluegrass, tango and folk music.

The bass is a transposing instrument and is typically notated one octave higher than tuned to avoid excessive ledger lines below the staff. The double bass is the only modern bowed string instrument that is tuned in fourths (like a bass guitar or viol), rather than fifths, with strings usually tuned to E1, A1, D2 and G2. 

The instrument's exact lineage is still a matter of some debate, with scholars divided on whether the bass is derived from the viol or the violin family.

The double bass is played with a bow (arco), or by plucking the strings (pizzicato), or via a variety of extended techniques. In orchestral repertoire and tango music, both arco and pizzicato are employed. In jazz, blues, and rockabilly, pizzicato is the norm. Classical music and jazz use the natural sound produced acoustically by the instrument, as does traditional bluegrass. In funk, blues, reggae, and related genres, the double bass is often amplified.

Description

The double bass stands around  from scroll to endpin. However, other sizes are available, such as a  or , which serve to accommodate a player's height and hand size. These sizes do not reflect the size relative to a full size, or  bass; a  bass is not half the length of a  bass, but is only about 15% smaller. It is typically constructed from several types of wood, including maple for the back, spruce for the top, and ebony for the fingerboard. It is uncertain whether the instrument is a descendant of the viola da gamba or of the violin, but it is traditionally aligned with the violin family. While the double bass is nearly identical in construction to other violin family instruments, it also embodies features found in the older viol family.

The notes of the open strings are E1, A1, D2, and G2, the same as an acoustic or electric bass guitar. However, the resonance of the wood, combined with the violin-like construction and long scale length gives the double bass a much richer tone than the bass guitar, in addition to the ability to use a bow, while the fretless fingerboard accommodates smooth glissandos and legatos.

Playing style
Like other violin and viol-family string instruments, the double bass is played either with a bow (arco) or by plucking the strings (pizzicato). When employing a bow, the player can either use it traditionally or strike the wood of the bow against the string. In orchestral repertoire and tango music, both arco and pizzicato are employed. In jazz, blues, and rockabilly, pizzicato is the norm, except for some solos and occasional written parts in modern jazz that call for bowing.

In classical pedagogy, almost all of the focus is on performing with the bow and producing a good bowed tone; there is little work done on developing significant pizzicato skills. Bowed notes in the lowest register of the instrument produce a dark, heavy, mighty, or even menacing effect, when played with a fortissimo dynamic; however, the same low pitches played with a delicate pianissimo can create a sonorous, mellow accompaniment line. Classical bass students learn all of the different bow articulations used by other string section players (e.g., violin and cello), such as détaché, legato, staccato, sforzato, martelé (""hammered""-style), sul ponticello, sul tasto, tremolo, spiccato and sautillé. Some of these articulations can be combined; for example, the combination of sul ponticello and tremolo can produce eerie, ghostly sounds. Classical bass players do play pizzicato parts in orchestra, but these parts generally require simple notes (quarter notes, half notes, whole notes), rather than rapid passages.

Classical players perform both bowed and pizz notes using vibrato, an effect created by rocking or quivering the left hand finger that is contacting the string, which then transfers an undulation in pitch to the tone. Vibrato is used to add expression to string playing. In general, very loud, low-register passages are played with little or no vibrato, as the main goal with low pitches is to provide a clear fundamental bass for the string section. Mid- and higher-register melodies are typically played with more vibrato. The speed and intensity of the vibrato is varied by the performer for an emotional and musical effect.

In jazz, rockabilly and other related genres, much or all of the focus is on playing pizzicato. In jazz and jump blues, bassists are required to play rapid pizzicato walking basslines for extended periods. Jazz and rockabilly bassists develop virtuoso pizzicato techniques that enable them to play rapid solos that incorporate fast-moving triplet and sixteenth note figures. Pizzicato basslines performed by leading jazz professionals are much more difficult than the pizzicato basslines that classical bassists encounter in the standard orchestral literature, which are typically whole notes, half notes, quarter notes, and occasional eighth note passages. In jazz and related styles, bassists often add semi-percussive ""ghost notes"" into basslines, to add to the rhythmic feel and to add fills to a bassline.

The double bass player stands, or sits on a high stool, and leans the instrument against their body, turned slightly inward to put the strings comfortably in reach. This stance is a key reason for the bass's sloped shoulders, which mark it apart from the other members of the violin family—the narrower shoulders facilitate playing the strings in their higher registers.

History

The double bass is generally regarded as a modern descendant of the string family of instruments that originated in Europe in the 15th century, and as such has been described as a bass Violin. Before the 20th century many double basses had only three strings, in contrast to the five to six strings typical of instruments in the viol family or the four strings of instruments in the violin family. The double bass's proportions are dissimilar to those of the violin and cello; for example, it is deeper (the distance from front to back is proportionally much greater than the violin). In addition, while the violin has bulging shoulders, most double basses have shoulders carved with a more acute slope, like members of the viol family. Many very old double basses have had their shoulders cut or sloped to aid playing with modern techniques. Before these modifications, the design of their shoulders was closer to instruments of the violin family.

The double bass is the only modern bowed string instrument that is tuned in fourths (like a viol), rather than fifths (see Tuning below). The instrument's exact lineage is still a matter of some debate, and the supposition that the double bass is a direct descendant of the viol family is one that has not been entirely resolved.

In his A New History of the Double Bass, Paul Brun asserts that the double bass has origins as the true bass of the violin family. He states that, while the exterior of the double bass may resemble the viola da gamba, the internal construction of the double bass is nearly identical to instruments in the violin family, and very different from the internal structure of viols.

Double bass professor Larry Hurst argues that the ""modern double bass is not a true member of either the violin or viol families"". He says that ""most likely its first general shape was that of a violone, the largest member of the viol family. Some of the earliest basses extant are violones, (including C-shaped sound holes) that have been fitted with modern trappings."" Some existing instruments, such as those by Gasparo da Salò, were converted from 16th-century six-string contrabass violoni.

Terminology

A person who plays this instrument is called a ""bassist"", ""double bassist"", ""double bass player"", ""contrabassist"", ""contrabass player"" or ""bass player"". The names contrabass and  double bass refer to the instrument's range and use one octave lower than the cello (i.e. doubling on cello). The terms for the instrument among classical performers are contrabass (which comes from the instrument's Italian name, contrabbasso), string bass (to distinguish it from brass bass instruments in a concert band, such as tubas), or simply bass.

In jazz, blues, rockabilly and other genres outside of classical music, this instrument is commonly called the upright bass, standup bass or acoustic bass to distinguish it from the (usually electric) bass guitar. In folk and bluegrass music, the instrument is also referred to as a ""bass fiddle"" or ""bass violin"" (or more rarely as ""doghouse bass"" or ""bull fiddle""
). As a member of the violin-family of instruments, the construction of the upright bass is quite different from that of the acoustic bass guitar, as the latter is a derivative of the electric bass guitar, and usually built like a larger and sturdier variant of an acoustic guitar.

The double bass is sometimes confusingly called the violone, bass violin or bass viol. Other colourful names or nicknames are found in other languages. In Hungarian, the double bass is called nagybőgő, which roughly translates as ""big crier"", referring to its large voice.

Design

In general, there are two major approaches to the design outline shape of the double bass: the violin form (shown in the labelled picture in the construction section); and the viola da gamba form (shown in the header picture of this article). A third less common design, called the busetto shape, can also be found, as can the even more rare guitar or pear shape. The back of the instrument can vary from being a round, carved back similar to that of the violin, to a flat and angled back similar to the viol family.

The double bass features many parts that are similar to members of the violin family, including a wooden, carved bridge to support the strings, two f-holes, a tailpiece into which the ball ends of the strings are inserted (with the tailpiece anchored around the endpin mount), an ornamental scroll near the pegbox, a nut with grooves for each string at the junction of the fingerboard and the pegbox and a sturdy, thick sound post, which transmits the vibrations from the top of the instrument to the hollow body and supports the pressure of the string tension. Unlike the rest of the violin family, the double bass still reflects influences from, and can be considered partly derived, from the viol family of instruments, in particular the violone, the lowest-pitched and largest bass member of the viol family. For example, the bass is tuned in fourths, like a viol, rather than in fifths, which is the standard in the violin group. Also, notice that the 'shoulders' meet the neck in a curve, rather than the sharp angle seen among violins. As with the other violin and viol family instruments that are played with a bow (and unlike mainly plucked or picked instruments like guitar), the double bass's bridge has an arc-like, curved shape. This is done because with bowed instruments, the player must be able to play individual strings. If the double bass were to have a flat bridge, it would be impossible to bow the A and D strings individually.

The double bass also differs from members of the violin family in that the shoulders are typically sloped and the back is often angled (both to allow easier access to the instrument, particularly in the upper range). Machine tuners are always fitted, in contrast to the rest of the violin family, where traditional wooden friction pegs are still the primary means of tuning. Lack of standardization in design means that one double bass can sound and look very different from another.

Construction
The double bass is closest in construction to violins, but has some notable similarities to the violone (""large viol""), the largest and lowest-pitched member of the viol family. Unlike the violone, however, the fingerboard of the double bass is unfretted, and the double bass has fewer strings (the violone, like most viols, generally had six strings, although some specimens had five or four). The fingerboard is made of ebony on high-quality instruments; on less expensive student instruments, other woods may be used and then painted or stained black (a process called ""ebonizing""). The fingerboard is radiused using a curve, for the same reason that the bridge is curved: if the fingerboard and bridge were to be flat, then a bassist would not be able to bow the inner two strings individually. By using a curved bridge and a curved fingerboard, the bassist can align the bow with any of the four strings and play them individually. Unlike the violin and viola, but like the cello, the bass fingerboard is somewhat flattened out underneath the E string (the C string on cello), this is commonly known as a Romberg bevel. The vast majority of fingerboards cannot be adjusted by the performer; any adjustments must be made by a luthier. A very small number of expensive basses for professionals have adjustable fingerboards, in which a screw mechanism can be used to raise or lower the fingerboard height.

An important distinction between the double bass and other members of the violin family is the construction of the pegbox and the tuning mechanism. While the violin, viola, and cello all use friction pegs for tuning adjustments (tightening and loosening the string tension to raise or lower the string's pitch), the double bass has metal machine heads and gears. One of the challenges with tuning pegs is that the friction between the wood peg and the peg hole may become insufficient to hold the peg in place, particularly if the peg hole become worn and enlarged. The key on the tuning machine of a double bass turns a metal worm, which drives a worm gear that winds the string. Turning the key in one direction tightens the string (thus raising its pitch); turning the key the opposite direction reduces the tension on the string (thus lowering its pitch). While this development makes fine tuners on the tailpiece (important for violin, viola and cello players, as their instruments use friction pegs for major pitch adjustments) unnecessary, a very small number of bassists use them nevertheless. One rationale for using fine tuners on bass is that for instruments with the low C extension, the pulley system for the long string may not effectively transfer turns of the key into changes of string tension/pitch. At the base of the double bass is a metal rod with a spiked or rubberized end called the endpin, which rests on the floor. This endpin is generally thicker and more robust than that of a cello, because of the greater mass of the instrument.

The materials most often used in double bass construction for fully carved basses (the type used by professional orchestra bassists and soloists) are maple (back, neck, ribs), spruce (top), and ebony (fingerboard, tailpiece). The tailpiece may be made from other types of wood or non-wood materials. Less expensive basses are typically constructed with laminated (plywood) tops, backs, and ribs, or are hybrid models produced with laminated backs and sides and carved solid wood tops. Some 2010-era lower- to mid-priced basses are made of willow, student models constructed of Fiberglass were produced in the mid-20th century, and some (typically fairly expensive) basses have been constructed of carbon fiber.

Laminated (plywood) basses, which are widely used in music schools, youth orchestras, and in popular and folk music settings (including rockabilly, psychobilly, blues, etc.), are very resistant to humidity and heat, as well to the physical abuse they are apt to encounter in a school environment (or, for blues and folk musicians, to the hazards of touring and performing in bars). Another option is the hybrid body bass, which has a laminated back and a carved or solid wood top. It is less costly and somewhat less fragile (at least regarding its back) than a fully carved bass.

The soundpost and bass bar are components of the internal construction. All the parts of a double bass are glued together, except the soundpost, bridge, and tailpiece, which are held in place by string tension (although the soundpost usually remains in place when the instrument's strings are loosened or removed, as long as the bass is kept on its back. Some luthiers recommend changing only one string at a time to reduce the risk of the soundpost falling). If the soundpost falls, a luthier is needed to put the soundpost back into position, as this must be done with tools inserted into the f-holes; moreover, the exact placement of the soundpost under the bridge is essential for the instrument to sound its best. Basic bridges are carved from a single piece of wood, which is customized to match the shape of the top of each instrument. The least expensive bridges on student instruments may be customized just by sanding the feet to match the shape of the instrument's top. A bridge on a professional bassist's instrument may be ornately carved by a luthier.

Professional bassists are more likely to have adjustable bridges, which have a metal screw mechanism. This enables the bassist to raise or lower the height of the strings to accommodate changing humidity or temperature conditions.  The metal tuning machines are attached to the sides of the pegbox with metal screws. While tuning mechanisms generally differ from the higher-pitched orchestral stringed instruments, some basses have non-functional, ornamental tuning pegs projecting from the side of the pegbox, in imitation of the tuning pegs on a cello or violin.

Famous double bass makers come from around the world and often represent varied national characteristics. The most highly sought (and expensive) instruments come from Italy and include basses made by Giovanni Paolo Maggini, Gasparo da Salò, the Testore family (Carlo Antonio, Carlo Giuseppe, Gennaro, Giovanni, Paulo Antonio), Celestino Puolotti, and Matteo Goffriller. French and English basses from famous makers are also sought out by players.

Travel instruments
Several manufacturers make travel instruments, which are double basses that have features which reduce the size of the instrument so that the instrument will meet airline travel requirements. Travel basses are designed for touring musicians. One type of travel bass has a much smaller body than normal, while still retaining all of the features needed for playing. While these smaller-body instruments appear similar to electric upright basses, the difference is that small-body travel basses still have a fairly large hollow acoustic sound chamber, while many EUBs are solid body, or only have a small hollow chamber. A second type of travel bass has a hinged or removable neck and a regular sized body. The hinged or removable neck makes the instrument smaller when it is packed for transportation.

Strings

The history of the double bass is tightly coupled to the development of string technology, as it was the advent of overwound gut strings, which first rendered the instrument more generally practicable, as wound or overwound strings attain low notes within a smaller overall string diameter than non-wound strings. Professor Larry Hurst argues that had ""it not been for the appearance of the overwound gut string in the 1650s, the double bass would surely have become extinct"", because thicknesses needed for regular gut strings made the lower-pitched strings almost unplayable and hindered the development of fluid, rapid playing in the lower register.

Prior to the 20th century, double bass strings were usually made of catgut; however, steel has largely replaced it, because steel strings hold their pitch better and yield more volume when played with the bow. Gut strings are also more vulnerable to changes of humidity and temperature, and break more easily than steel strings.

Gut strings are nowadays mostly used by bassists who perform in baroque ensembles, rockabilly bands, traditional blues bands, and bluegrass bands. In some cases, the low E and A are wound in silver, to give them added mass. Gut strings provide the dark, ""thumpy"" sound heard on 1940s and 1950s recordings. The late Jeff Sarli, a blues upright bassist, said that ""Starting in the 1950s, they began to reset the necks on basses for steel strings."" Rockabilly and bluegrass bassists also prefer gut because it is much easier to perform the ""slapping"" upright bass style (in which the strings are percussively slapped and clicked against the fingerboard) with gut strings than with steel strings, because gut does not hurt the plucking fingers as much. A less expensive alternative to gut strings is nylon strings; the higher strings are pure nylon, and the lower strings are nylon wrapped in wire, to add more mass to the string, slowing the vibration, and thus facilitating lower pitches.

The change from gut to steel has also affected the instrument's playing technique over the last hundred years. Steel strings can be set up closer to the fingerboard and, additionally, strings can be played in higher positions on the lower strings and still produce clear tone. The classic 19th century Franz Simandl method does not use the low E string in higher positions because older gut strings, set up high over the fingerboard, could not produce clear tone in these higher positions. However, with modern steel strings, bassists can play with clear tone in higher positions on the low E and A strings, particularly when they use modern lighter-gauge, lower-tension steel strings.

Bows
The double bass bow comes in two distinct forms (shown below). The ""French"" or ""overhand"" bow is similar in shape and implementation to the bow used on the other members of the orchestral string instrument family, while the ""German"" or ""Butler"" bow is typically broader and shorter, and is held in a ""hand shake"" (or ""hacksaw"") position.

These two bows provide different ways of moving the arm and distributing force and weight on the strings. Proponents of the French bow argue that it is more maneuverable, due to the angle at which the player holds the bow. Advocates of the German bow claim that it allows the player to apply more arm weight on the strings. The differences between the two, however, are minute for a proficient player, and modern players in major orchestras use both bows.

German bow

The German bow (sometimes called the Butler bow) is the older of the two designs. The design of the bow and the manner of holding it descend from the older viol instrument family. With older viols, before frogs had screw threads to tighten the bow, players held the bow with two fingers between the stick and the hair to maintain tension of the hair. Proponents of the use of German bow claim that the German bow is easier to use for heavy strokes that require a lot of power.

Compared to the French bow, the German bow has a taller frog, and the player holds it with the palm angled upwards, as with the upright members of the viol family. When held in the traditionally correct manner, the thumb applies the necessary power to generate the desired sound. The index finger meets the bow at the point where the frog meets the stick. The index finger also applies an upward torque to the frog when tilting the bow. The little finger (or ""pinky"") supports the frog from underneath, while the ring finger and middle finger rest in the space between the hair and the shaft.

French bow

The French bow was not widely popular until its adoption by 19th-century virtuoso Giovanni Bottesini. This style is more similar to the traditional bows of the smaller string family instruments. It is held as if the hand is resting by the side of the performer with the palm facing toward the bass. The thumb rests on the shaft of the bow, next to the frog while the other fingers drape on the other side of the bow. Various styles dictate the curve of the fingers and thumb, as do the style of piece; a more pronounced curve and lighter hold on the bow is used for virtuoso or more delicate pieces, while a flatter curve and sturdier grip on the bow sacrifices some power for easier control in strokes such as detaché, spiccato, and staccato.

Bow construction and materials
Double bass bows vary in length, ranging from . In general, a bass bow is shorter and heavier than a cello bow. Pernambuco, also known as Brazilwood, is regarded as an excellent quality stick material, but due to its scarcity and expense, other materials are increasingly being used. Inexpensive student bows may be constructed of solid fiberglass, which makes the bow much lighter than a wooden bow (even too light to produce a good tone, in some cases). Student bows may also be made of the less valuable varieties of brazilwood. Snakewood and carbon fiber are also used in bows of a variety of different qualities. The frog of the double bass bow is usually made out of ebony, although snakewood and buffalo horn are used by some luthiers. The frog is movable, as it can be tightened or loosened with a knob (like all violin family bows). The bow is loosened at the end of a practice session or performance. The bow is tightened before playing, until it reaches a tautness that is preferred by the player. The frog on a quality bow is decorated with mother of pearl inlay.

Bows have a leather wrapping on the wooden part of the bow near the frog. Along with the leather wrapping, there is also a wire wrapping, made of gold or silver in quality bows. The hair is usually horsehair. Part of the regular maintenance of a bow is having the bow ""rehaired"" by a luthier with fresh horsehair and having the leather and wire wrapping replaced. The double bass bow is strung with either white or black horsehair, or a combination of the two (known as ""salt and pepper""), as opposed to the customary white horsehair used on the bows of other string instruments. Some bassists argue that the slightly rougher black hair ""grabs"" the heavier, lower strings better. As well, some bassists and luthiers believe that it is easier to produce a smoother sound with the white variety.  Red hair (chestnut) is also used by some bassists. Some of the lowest-quality, lowest cost student bows are made with synthetic hair. Synthetic hair does not have the tiny ""barbs"" that real horsehair has, so it does not ""grip"" the string well or take rosin well.

Rosin

String players apply rosin to the bow hair so it ""grips"" the string and makes it vibrate. Double bass rosin is generally softer and stickier than violin rosin to allow the hair to grab the thicker strings better, but players use a wide variety of rosins that vary from quite hard (like violin rosin) to quite soft, depending on the weather, the humidity, and the preference of the player. The amount used generally depends on the type of music being performed as well as the personal preferences of the player. Bassists may apply more rosin in works for large orchestra (e.g., Brahms symphonies) than for delicate chamber works. Some brands of rosin, such as Wiedoeft or Pop's double bass rosin, are softer and more prone to melting in hot weather. Other brands, such as Carlsson or Nyman Harts double bass rosin, are harder and less prone to melting.

Mechanism of sound production
Owing to their relatively small diameters, the strings themselves do not move much air and therefore cannot produce much sound on their own. The vibrational energy of the strings must somehow be transferred to the surrounding air. 
To do this, the strings vibrate the bridge and this in turn vibrates the top surface. Very small amplitude but relatively large force variations (due to the cyclically varying tension in the vibrating string) at the bridge are transformed to larger amplitude ones by combination of bridge and body of the bass. The bridge transforms the high force, small amplitude vibrations to lower force higher amplitude vibrations on the top of the bass body. The top is connected to the back by means of a sound post, so the back also vibrates. Both the front and back transmit the vibrations to the air and act to match the impedance of the vibrating string to the acoustic impedance of the air.

Specific sound and tone production mechanism
Because the acoustic bass is a non-fretted instrument, any string vibration due to plucking or bowing will cause an audible sound due to the strings vibrating against the fingerboard near to the fingered position. This busing sound gives the note its character.

Pitch

The lowest note of a double bass is an E1 (on standard four-string basses) at approximately 41 Hz or a C1 (≈33 Hz), or sometimes B0 (≈31 Hz), when five strings are used. This is within about an octave above the lowest frequency that the average human ear can perceive as a distinctive pitch. The top of the instrument's fingerboard range is typically near D5, two octaves and a fifth above the open pitch of the G string (G2), as shown in the range illustration found at the head of this article. Playing beyond the end of the fingerboard can be accomplished by pulling the string slightly to the side.

Double bass symphony parts sometimes indicate that the performer should play harmonics (also called flageolet tones), in which the bassist lightly touches the string–without pressing it onto the fingerboard in the usual fashion–in the location of a note and then plucks or bows the note. Bowed harmonics are used in contemporary music for their ""glassy"" sound. Both natural harmonics and artificial harmonics, where the thumb stops the note and the octave or other harmonic is activated by lightly touching the string at the relative node point, extend the instrument's range considerably. Natural and artificial harmonics are used in plenty of virtuoso concertos for the double bass.

Orchestral parts from the standard Classical repertoire rarely demand the double bass exceed a two-octave and a minor third range, from E1 to G3, with occasional A3s appearing in the standard repertoire (an exception to this rule is Orff's Carmina Burana, which calls for three octaves and a perfect fourth). The upper limit of this range is extended a great deal for 20th- and 21st-century orchestral parts (e.g., Prokofiev's Lieutenant Kijé Suite (1933) bass solo, which calls for notes as high as D4 and E4). The upper range a virtuoso solo player can achieve using natural and artificial harmonics is hard to define, as it depends on the skill of the particular player. The high harmonic in the range illustration found at the head of this article may be taken as representative rather than normative.

Five-string instruments have an additional string, typically tuned to a low B below the E string (B0). On rare occasions, a higher string is added instead, tuned to the C above the G string (C3). Four-string instruments may feature the C extension extending the range of the E string downwards to C1 (sometimes B0).

Traditionally, the double bass is a transposing instrument. Since much of the double bass's range lies below the standard bass clef, it is notated an octave higher than it sounds to avoid having to use excessive ledger lines below the staff. Thus, when double bass players and cellists are playing from a combined bass-cello part, as used in many Mozart and Haydn symphonies, they will play in octaves, with the basses one octave below the cellos. This transposition applies even when bass players are reading the tenor and treble clef (which are used in solo playing and some orchestral parts). The tenor clef is also used by composers for cello and low brass parts. The use of tenor or treble clef avoids excessive ledger lines above the staff when notating the instrument's upper range. Other notation traditions exist. Italian solo music is typically written at the sounding pitch, and the ""old"" German method sounded an octave below where notation except in the treble clef, where the music was written at pitch.

Tuning

Regular tuning

The double bass is generally tuned in fourths, in contrast to other members of the orchestral string family, which are tuned in fifths (for example, the violin's four strings are, from lowest-pitched to highest-pitched: G–D–A–E). The standard tuning (lowest-pitched to highest-pitched) for bass is E–A–D–G, starting from E below second low C (concert pitch). This is the same as the standard tuning of a bass guitar and is one octave lower than the four lowest-pitched strings of standard guitar tuning. Prior to the 19th-century, many double basses had only three strings; ""Giovanni Bottesini (1821–1889) favored the three-stringed instrument popular in Italy at the time"", because ""the three-stringed instrument [was viewed as] being more sonorous"". Many cobla bands in Catalonia still have players using traditional three-string double basses tuned A–D–G.

Throughout classical repertoire, there are notes that fall below the range of a standard double bass. Notes below low E appear regularly in the double bass parts found in later arrangements and interpretations of Baroque music. In the Classical era, the double bass typically doubled the cello part an octave below, occasionally requiring descent to C below the E of the four-string double bass. In the Romantic era and the 20th century, composers such as Wagner, Mahler, Busoni and Prokofiev also requested notes below the low E.

There are several methods for making these notes available to the player. Players with standard double basses (E–A–D–G) may play the notes below ""E"" an octave higher or if this sounds awkward, the entire passage may be transposed up an octave. The player may tune the low E string down to the lowest note required in the piece: D or C. Four-string basses may be fitted with a ""low-C extension"" (see below). Or the player may employ a five-string instrument, with the additional lower string tuned to C, or (more commonly in modern times) B, three octaves and a semitone below middle C. Several major European orchestras use basses with a fifth string.

C extension

Most professional orchestral players use four-string double basses with a C extension. This is an extra section of fingerboard mounted on the head of the bass. It extends the fingerboard under the lowest string and gives an additional four semitones of downward range. The lowest string is typically tuned down to C1, an octave below the lowest note on the cello (as it is quite common for a bass part to double the cello part an octave lower). More rarely this string may be tuned to a low B0, as a few works in the orchestral repertoire call for such a B, such as Respighi's The Pines of Rome. In rare cases, some players have a low B extension, which has B as its lowest note. There are several varieties of extensions:

In the simplest mechanical extensions, there are no mechanical aids attached to the fingerboard extension except a locking nut or ""gate"" for the E note. To play the extension notes, the player reaches back over the area under the scroll to press the string to the fingerboard. The advantage of this ""fingered"" extension is that the player can adjust the intonation of all of the stopped notes on the extension, and there are no mechanical noises from metal keys and levers. The disadvantage of the ""fingered"" extension is that it can be hard to perform rapid alternations between low notes on the extension and notes on the regular fingerboard, such as a bassline that quickly alternates between G1 and D1.

The simplest type of mechanical aid is the use of wooden ""fingers"" or ""gates"" that can be closed to press the string down and fret the C, D, E, or E notes. This system is particularly useful for basslines that have a repeating pedal point such as a low D because once the note is locked in place with the mechanical finger the lowest string sounds a different note when played open.

The most complicated mechanical aid for use with extensions is the mechanical lever system nicknamed the machine. This lever system, which superficially resembles the keying mechanism of reed instruments such as the bassoon, mounts levers beside the regular fingerboard (near the nut, on the E-string side), which remotely activate metal ""fingers"" on the extension fingerboard. The most expensive metal lever systems also give the player the ability to ""lock"" down notes on the extension fingerboard, as with the wooden ""finger"" system. One criticism of these devices is that they may lead to unwanted metallic clicking noises.

Once a mechanical ""finger"" of the wooden ""finger"" extension or the metal ""finger"" machine extension is locked down or depressed, it is not easy to make microtonal pitch adjustments or glissando effects, as is possible with a hand-fingered extension.

Five-string basses, in which the lowest string is normally B0, may use either a two semitone extension, providing a low A, or the very rare low G extension.

Other tuning variations
A small number of bass players tune their strings in fifths, like a cello but an octave lower (C1–G1–D2–A2 low to high). This tuning was used by the jazz player Red Mitchell and is used by some classical players, notably the Canadian bassist Joel Quarrington. Advocates of tuning the bass in fifths point out that all of the other orchestral strings are tuned in fifths (violin, viola, and cello), so this puts the bass in the same tuning approach. Fifth tuning provides a bassist with a wider range of pitch than a standard E–A–D–G bass, as it ranges (without an extension) from C1 to A2. Some players who use fifths tuning who play a five-string bass use an additional high E3 string (thus, from lowest to highest: C–G–D–A–E). Some fifth tuning bassists who only have a four string instrument and who are mainly performing soloistic works use the G–D–A–E tuning, thus omitting the low C string but gaining a high E. Some fifth tuning bassists who use a five-string use a smaller scale instrument, thus making fingering somewhat easier. The Berlioz–Strauss Treatise on Instrumentation (first published in 1844) states that ""A good orchestra should have several four-string double-basses, some of them tuned in fifths and thirds."" The book then shows a tuning of E1–G1–D2–A2) from bottom to top string. ""Together with the other double-basses tuned in fourths, a combination of open strings would be available, which would greatly increase the sonority of the orchestra."" 

In classical solo playing the double bass is usually tuned a whole tone higher (F1–B1–E2–A2). This higher tuning is called ""solo tuning"", whereas the regular tuning is known as ""orchestral tuning"". Solo tuning strings are generally thinner than regular strings. String tension differs so much between solo and orchestral tuning that a different set of strings is often employed that has a lighter gauge. Strings are always labelled for either solo or orchestral tuning and published solo music is arranged for either solo or orchestral tuning. Some popular solos and concerti, such as the Koussevitsky Concerto are available in both solo and orchestral tuning arrangements. Solo tuning strings can be tuned down a tone to play in orchestra pitch, but the strings often lack projection in orchestral tuning and their pitch may be unstable.

Some contemporary composers specify highly specialized scordatura (intentionally changing the tuning of the open strings). Changing the pitch of the open strings makes different notes available as pedal points and harmonics.
Berio, for example, asks the player to tune their strings E1–G1–D2–G2 in Sequenza XIVb and Scelsi asks for both F1–A1–D2–E2 and F1–A1–F2–E2 in Nuits. A variant and much less-commonly used form of solo tuning used in some Eastern European countries is (A1–D2–G2–C3), which omits the low E string from orchestral tuning and then adds a high C string. Some bassists with five-string basses use a high C3 string as the fifth string, instead of a low B0 string. Adding the high C string facilitates the performance of solo repertoire with a high tessitura (range). Another option is to utilize both a low C (or low B) extension and a high C string.

Five strings
When choosing a bass with a fifth string, the player may decide between adding a higher-pitched string (a high C string) or a lower-pitched string (typically a low B). To accommodate the additional fifth string, the fingerboard is usually slightly widened, and the top slightly thicker, to handle the increased tension. Most five-string basses are therefore larger in size than a standard four-string bass. Some five-stringed instruments are converted four-string instruments. Because these do not have wider fingerboards, some players find them more difficult to finger and bow. Converted four-string basses usually require either a new, thicker top, or lighter strings to compensate for the increased tension.

Six strings

The six-string double bass has both a high C and a low B, making it very useful, and it is becoming more practical after several updates. It is ideal for solo and orchestral playing because it has a more playable range. Many people achieved this on a six-string violone by restringing it with double bass strings making the tuning B0–E1–A1–D2–G2–C3.

Playing and performance considerations

Body and hand position

Double bassists either stand or sit to play the instrument. The instrument height is set by adjusting the endpin such that the player can reach the desired playing zones of the strings with bow or plucking hand. Bassists who stand and bow sometimes set the endpin by aligning the first finger in either first or half position with eye level, although there is little standardization in this regard. Players who sit generally use a stool about the height of the player's trousers inseam length.

Traditionally, double bassists stood to play solo and sat to play in the orchestra or opera pit. Now, it is unusual for a player to be equally proficient in both positions, so some soloists sit (as with Joel Quarrington, Jeff Bradetich, Thierry Barbé, and others) and some orchestral bassists stand.

When playing in the instrument's upper range (above G3, the G below middle C), the player shifts the hand from behind the neck and flattens it out, using the side of the thumb to press down the string. This technique—also used on the cello—is called thumb position. While playing in thumb position, few players use the fourth (little) finger, as it is usually too weak to produce reliable tone (this is also true for cellists), although some extreme chords or extended techniques, especially in contemporary music, may require its use.

Physical considerations
Rockabilly style can be very demanding on the plucking hand, due to rockabilly's use of ""slapping"" on the fingerboard.
Performing on bass can be physically demanding, because the strings are under relatively high tension. Also, the space between notes on the fingerboard is large, due to scale length and string spacing, so players must hold their fingers apart for the notes in the lower positions and shift positions frequently to play basslines. As with all non-fretted string instruments, performers must learn to place their fingers precisely to produce the correct pitch. For bassists with shorter arms or smaller hands, the large spaces between pitches may present a significant challenge, especially in the lowest range, where the spaces between notes are largest. However, the increased use of playing techniques such as thumb position and modifications to the bass, such as the use of lighter-gauge strings at lower tension, have eased the difficulty of playing the instrument.

Bass parts have relatively fewer fast passages, double stops, or large jumps in range. These parts are usually given to the cello section, since the cello is a smaller instrument on which these techniques are more easily performed.

Until the 1990s, child-sized double basses were not widely available, and the large size of the bass prevented children from playing the instrument until they grew to a height and hand size that allowed them to play a -size model (the most common size). Starting in the 1990s, smaller , , , and even -sized instruments became more widely available, so children could start younger.

Volume
Despite the size of the instrument, it is not as loud as many other instruments, due to its low musical pitch. In a large orchestra, usually between four and eight bassists play the same bassline in unison to produce enough volume. In the largest orchestras, bass sections may have as many as ten or twelve players, but modern budget constraints make bass sections this large unusual.

When writing solo passages for the bass in orchestral or chamber music, composers typically ensure the orchestration is light so it does not obscure the bass. While amplification is rarely used in classical music, in some cases where a bass soloist performs a concerto with a full orchestra, subtle amplification called acoustic enhancement may be used. The use of microphones and amplifiers in a classical setting has led to debate within the classical community, as ""...purists maintain that the natural acoustic sound of [Classical] voices [or] instruments in a given hall should not be altered"".

In many genres, such as jazz and blues, players use amplification via a specialized amplifier and loudspeakers. A piezoelectric pickup connects to the amplifier with a -inch patch cable. Bluegrass and jazz players typically use less amplification than blues, psychobilly, or jam band players. In the latter cases, high overall volume from other amplifiers and instruments may cause unwanted acoustic feedback, a problem exacerbated by the bass's large surface area and interior volume. The feedback problem has led to technological fixes like electronic feedback eliminator devices (essentially an automated notch filter that identifies and reduces frequencies where feedback occurs) and instruments like the electric upright bass, which has playing characteristics like the double bass but usually little or no soundbox, which makes feedback less likely. Some bassists reduce the problem of feedback by lowering their onstage volume or playing further away from their bass amp speakers.

In rockabilly and psychobilly, percussively slapping the strings against the fingerboard is an important part of the bass playing style. Since piezoelectric pickups are not good at reproducing the sounds of strings being slapped against the fingerboard, bassists in these genres often use both piezoelectric pickups (for the low bass tone) and a miniature condenser mic (to pick up the percussive slapping sounds). These two signals are blended together using a simple mixer before the signal is sent to the bass amp.

Transportation
The double bass's large size and relative fragility make it cumbersome to handle and transport. Most bassists use soft cases, referred to as gig bags, to protect the instrument during transport. These range from inexpensive, thin unpadded cases used by students (which only protect against scratches and rain) to thickly padded versions for professional players, which also protect against bumps and impacts. Some bassists carry their bow in a hard bow case; more expensive bass cases have a large pocket for a bow case. Players also may use a small cart and end pin-attached wheels to move the bass. Some higher-priced padded cases have wheels attached to the case. Another option found in higher-priced padded cases are backpack straps, to make it easier to carry the instrument.

Hard flight cases have cushioned interiors and tough exteriors of carbon fiber, graphite, fiberglass, or Kevlar. The cost of good hard cases–several thousand US dollars–and the high airline fees for shipping them tend to limit their use to touring professionals.

Accessories

Double bass players use various accessories to help them to perform and rehearse. Three types of mutes are used in orchestral music: a wooden mute that slides onto the bridge, a rubber mute that attaches to the bridge and a wire device with brass weights that fits onto the bridge. The player uses the mute when the Italian instruction con sordino (""with mute"") appears in the bass part, and removes it in response to the instruction senza sordino (""without mute""). With the mute on, the tone of the bass is quieter, darker, and more somber. Bowed bass parts with a mute can have a nasal tone. Players use a third type of mute, a heavy rubber practice mute, to practice quietly without disturbing others (e.g., in a hotel room).

A quiver is an accessory for holding the bow. It is often made of leather and it attaches to the bridge and tailpiece with ties or straps. It is used to hold the bow while a player plays pizzicato parts.

A wolf tone eliminator is used to lessen unwanted sympathetic vibrations in the part of a string between the bridge and the tailpiece which can cause tone problems for certain notes. It is a rubber tube cut down the side that is used with a cylindrical metal sleeve which also has a slot on the side. The metal cylinder has a screw and a nut that fastens the device to the string. Different placements of the cylinder along the string influence or eliminate the frequency at which the wolf tone occurs. It is essentially an attenuator that slightly shifts the natural frequency of the string (and/or instrument body) cutting down on the reverberation. The wolf tone occurs because the strings below the bridge sometimes resonate at pitches close to notes on the playing part of the string. When the intended note makes the below-the-bridge string vibrate sympathetically, a dissonant ""wolf note"" or ""wolf tone"" can occur. In some cases, the wolf tone is strong enough to cause an audible ""beating"" sound. The wolf tone often occurs with the note G on the bass.

In orchestra, instruments tune to an A played by the oboist. Due to the three-octave gap between the oboist's tuning A and the open A string on the bass (for example, in an orchestra that tunes to 440 Hz, the oboist plays an A4 at 440 Hz and the open A1 of the bass is 55 Hz) it can be difficult to tune the bass by ear during the short period that the oboist plays the tuning note. Violinists, on the other hand, tune their A string to the same frequency as the oboist's tuning note. There is a method commonly used to tune a double bass in this context by playing the A harmonic on the D string (which is only an octave below the oboe A) and then matching the harmonics of the other strings. However, this method is not foolproof, since some basses' harmonics are not perfectly in tune with the open strings. To ensure the bass is in tune, some bassists use an electronic tuner that indicates pitch on a small display. Bassists who play in styles that use a bass amp, such as blues, rockabilly, or jazz, may use a stompbox-format electronic tuner, which mutes the bass pickup during tuning.

A double bass stand is used to hold the instrument in place and raise it a few inches off the ground. A wide variety of stands are available, and there is no one common design.

Classical repertoire

Solo works for double bass

1700s
The double bass as a solo instrument enjoyed a period of popularity during the 18th century and many of the most popular composers from that era wrote pieces for the double bass. The double bass, then often referred to as the Violone, used different tunings from region to region. The ""Viennese tuning"" (A1–D2–F2–A2) was popular, and in some cases a fifth string or even sixth string was added (F1–A1–D2–F2–A2). The popularity of the instrument is documented in Leopold Mozart's second edition of his Violinschule, where he writes ""One can bring forth difficult passages easier with the five-string violone, and I heard unusually beautiful performances of concertos, trios, solos, etc.""

The earliest known concerto for double bass was written by Joseph Haydn 1763, and is presumed lost in a fire at the Eisenstadt library. The earliest known existing concertos are by Carl Ditters von Dittersdorf, who composed two concertos for the double bass and a Sinfonia Concertante for viola and double bass. Other composers that have written concertos from this period include Johann Baptist Vanhal, Franz Anton Hoffmeister (3 concertos), Leopold Kozeluch, Anton Zimmermann, Antonio Capuzzi, Wenzel Pichl (2 concertos), and Johannes Matthias Sperger (18 concertos). While many of these names were leading figures to the music public of their time, they are generally unknown by contemporary audiences. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's concert aria, Per Questa Bella Mano, K.612 for bass, double bass obbligato, and orchestra contains impressive writing for solo double bass of that period. It remains popular among both singers and double bassists today.

The double bass eventually evolved to fit the needs of orchestras that required lower notes and a louder sound. The leading double bassists from the mid-to-late 18th century, such as Josef Kämpfer, Friedrich Pischelberger, and Johannes Mathias Sperger employed the ""Viennese"" tuning. Bassist Johann Hindle (1792–1862), who composed a concerto for the double bass, pioneered tuning the bass in fourths, which marked a turning point for the double bass and its role in solo works. Bassist Domenico Dragonetti was a prominent musical figure and an acquaintance of Haydn and Ludwig van Beethoven. His playing was known all the way from his homeland Italy to the Tsardom of Russia and he found a prominent place performing in concerts with the Philharmonic Society of London. Beethoven's friendship with Dragonetti may have inspired him to write difficult, separate parts for the double bass in his symphonies, such as the impressive passages in the third movement of the Fifth Symphony, the second movement of the Seventh Symphony, and last movement of the Ninth Symphony. These parts do not double the cello part.

Dragonetti wrote ten concertos for the double bass and many solo works for bass and piano. During Rossini's stay in London in the summer of 1824, he composed his popular Duetto for cello and double bass for Dragonetti and the cellist David Salomons. Dragonetti frequently played on a three string double bass tuned G–D–A from top to bottom. The use of only the top three strings was popular for bass soloists and principal bassists in orchestras in the 19th century, because it reduced the pressure on the wooden top of the bass, which was thought to create a more resonant sound. As well, the low E-strings used during the 19th century were thick cords made of gut, which were difficult to tune and play.

1800s

In the 19th century, the opera conductor, composer, and bassist Giovanni Bottesini was considered the ""Paganini of the double bass"" of his time, a reference to the violin virtuoso and composer. Bottesini's bass concertos were written in the popular Italian opera style of the 19th century, which exploit the double bass in a way that was not seen beforehand. They require virtuosic runs and great leaps to the highest registers of the instrument, even into the realm of natural and artificial harmonics. Many 19th century and early 20th century bassists considered these compositions unplayable, but in the 2000s, they are frequently performed. During the same time, a prominent school of bass players in the Czech region arose, which included Franz Simandl, Theodore Albin Findeisen, Josef Hrabe, Ludwig Manoly, and Adolf Mišek. Simandl and Hrabe were also pedagogues whose method books and studies remain in use in the 2000s.

1900s–present
The leading figure of the double bass in the early 20th century was Serge Koussevitzky, best known as conductor of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, who popularized the double bass in modern times as a solo instrument. Because of improvements to the double bass with steel strings and better set-ups, the bass is now played at a more advanced level than ever before and more and more composers have written works for the double bass. In the mid-century and in the following decades, many new concerti were written for the double bass, including Nikos Skalkottas's Concerto (1942), Eduard Tubin's Concerto (1948), Lars-Erik Larsson's Concertino (1957), Gunther Schuller's Concerto (1962), Hans Werner Henze's Concerto (1966) and Frank Proto's Concerto No. 1 (1968).

The Solo For Contrabass is one of the parts of John Cage's Concert For Piano And Orchestra and can be played as a solo, or with any of the other parts both orchestral and/or piano.  Similarly, his solo contrabass parts for the orchestral work Atlas Eclipticalis can also be performed as solos.  Cage's indeterminate works such as Variations I, Variations II, Fontana Mix, Cartridge Music et al. can be arranged for a solo contrabassist.  His work 26.1.1499 for a String Player is often realized by a solo contrabass player, although it can also be played by a violinist, violist, or cellist.

From the 1960s through the end of the century Gary Karr was the leading proponent of the double bass as a solo instrument and was active in commissioning or having hundreds of new works and concerti written especially for him. Karr was given Koussevitzky's famous solo double bass by Olga Koussevitsky and played it in concerts around the world for 40 years before, in turn, giving the instrument to the International Society of Bassists for talented soloists to use in concert. Another important performer in this period, Bertram Turetzky, commissioned and premiered more than 300 double bass works.

In the 1970s, 1980 and 1990s, new concerti included Nino Rota's Divertimento for Double Bass and Orchestra (1973), Alan Ridout's concerto for double bass and strings (1974), Jean Françaix's Concerto (1975), Frank Proto's Concerto No. 2, Einojuhani Rautavaara's Angel of Dusk (1980), Gian Carlo Menotti's Concerto (1983), Christopher Rouse's Concerto (1985), Henry Brant's Ghost Nets (1988) and Frank Proto's ""Carmen Fantasy for Double Bass and Orchestra"" (1991) and ""Four Scenes after Picasso"" Concerto No. 3 (1997). Peter Maxwell Davies' lyrical Strathclyde Concerto No. 7, for double bass and orchestra, dates from 1992.

In the first decade of the 21st century, new concerti include Frank Proto's ""Nine Variants on Paganini"" (2002), Kalevi Aho's Concerto (2005), John Harbison's Concerto for Bass Viol (2006), André Previn's Double Concerto for violin, double bass, and orchestra (2007) and John Woolrich's To the Silver Bow, for double bass, viola and strings (2014).

Reinhold Glière wrote an Intermezzo and Tarantella for double bass and piano, Op. 9, No. 1 and No. 2 and a Praeludium and Scherzo for double bass and piano, Op. 32 No. 1 and No. 2. Paul Hindemith wrote a rhythmically challenging Double Bass Sonata in 1949. Frank Proto wrote his Sonata ""1963"" for Double Bass and Piano. In the Soviet Union, Mieczysław Weinberg wrote his Sonata No. 1 for double bass solo in 1971. Giacinto Scelsi wrote two double bass pieces called Nuits in 1972, and then in 1976, he wrote Maknongan, a piece for any low-voiced instrument, such as double bass, contrabassoon, or tuba. Vincent Persichetti wrote solo works—which he called ""Parables""—for many instruments. He wrote Parable XVII for Double Bass, Op. 131 in 1974. Sofia Gubaidulina penned a Sonata for double bass and piano in 1975.  In 1976 American minimalist composer Tom Johnson wrote ""Failing – a very difficult piece for solo string bass"" in which the player has to perform an extremely virtuosic solo on the bass whilst simultaneously reciting a text which says how very difficult the piece is and how unlikely he or she is to successfully complete the performance without making a mistake.

In 1977 Dutch-Hungarian composer Geza Frid wrote a set of variations on The Elephant from Saint-Saëns' Le Carnaval des Animaux for scordatura Double Bass and string orchestra. In 1987 Lowell Liebermann wrote his Sonata for Contrabass and Piano Op. 24. Fernando Grillo wrote the ""Suite No. 1"" for double bass (1983/2005). Jacob Druckman wrote a piece for solo double bass entitled Valentine. US double bass soloist and composer Bertram Turetzky (born 1933) has performed and recorded more than 300 pieces written by and for him. He writes chamber music, baroque music, classical, jazz, renaissance music, improvisational music and world music

US minimalist composer Philip Glass wrote a prelude focused on the lower register that he scored for timpani and double bass. Italian composer Sylvano Bussotti, whose composing career spans from the 1930s to the first decade of the 21st century, wrote a solo work for bass in 1983 entitled Naked Angel Face per contrabbasso. Fellow Italian composer Franco Donatoni wrote a piece called Lem for contrabbasso in the same year. In 1989, French composer Pascal Dusapin (born 1955) wrote a solo piece called In et Out for double bass. In 1996, the Sorbonne-trained Lebanese composer Karim Haddad composed Ce qui dort dans l'ombre sacrée (""He who sleeps in the sacred shadows"") for Radio France's Presence Festival. Renaud Garcia-Fons (born 1962) is a French double bass player and composer, notable for drawing on jazz, folk, and Asian music for recordings of his pieces like Oriental Bass (1997).

Two significant recent works written for solo bass include, Mario Davidovsky's Synchronisms No.11 for double bass and electronic sounds and Elliott Carter's Figment III, for solo double bass. The German composer Gerhard Stäbler wrote Co-wie Kobalt (1989–90), ""...a music for double bass solo and grand orchestra"". Charles Wuorinen added several important works to the repertoire, Spinoff trio for double bass, violin and conga drums, and Trio for Bass Instruments double bass, tuba and bass trombone, and in 2007 Synaxis for double bass, horn, oboe and clarinet with timpani and strings. The suite ""Seven Screen Shots"" for double bass and piano (2005) by Ukrainian composer Alexander Shchetynsky has a solo bass part that includes many unconventional methods of playing. The German composer Claus Kühnl wrote Offene Weite / Open Expanse (1998) and Nachtschwarzes Meer, ringsum… (2005) for double bass and piano.In 1997 Joel Quarrington commissioned the American / Canadian composer Raymond Luedeke to write his ""Concerto for Double Bass and Orchestra"", a piece he performed with The Toronto Symphony Orchestra, with the Saskatoon Symphony Orchestra, and, in a version for small orchestra, with The Nova Scotia Symphony Orchestra. Composer Raymond Luedeke also composed a work for double bass, flute, and viola with narration, ""The Book of Questions"", with text by Pablo Neruda.

In 2004 Italian double bassist and composer Stefano Scodanibbio made a double bass arrangement of Luciano Berio's 2002 solo cello work Sequenza XIV with the new title Sequenza XIVb.

Chamber music with double bass
Since there is no established instrumental ensemble that includes the double bass, its use in chamber music has not been as exhaustive as the literature for ensembles such as the string quartet or piano trio. Despite this, there is a substantial number of chamber works that incorporate the double bass in both small and large ensembles.

There is a small body of works written for piano quintet with the instrumentation of piano, violin, viola, cello, and double bass. The most famous is Franz Schubert's Piano Quintet in A major, known as ""The Trout Quintet"" for its set of variations in the fourth movement of Schubert's Die Forelle. Other works for this instrumentation written from roughly the same period include those by Johann Nepomuk Hummel, George Onslow, Jan Ladislav Dussek, Louise Farrenc, Ferdinand Ries, Franz Limmer, Johann Baptist Cramer, and Hermann Goetz. Later composers who wrote chamber works for this quintet include Ralph Vaughan Williams, Colin Matthews, Jon Deak, Frank Proto, and John Woolrich. Slightly larger sextets written for piano, string quartet, and double bass have been written by Felix Mendelssohn, Mikhail Glinka, Richard Wernick, and Charles Ives.

In the genre of string quintets, there are a few works for string quartet with double bass. Antonín Dvořák's String Quintet in G major, Op.77 and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's Serenade in G major, K.525 (""Eine kleine Nachtmusik"") are the most popular pieces in this repertoire, along with works by Miguel del Aguila (Nostalgica for string quartet and bass), Darius Milhaud, Luigi Boccherini (3 quintets), Harold Shapero, and Paul Hindemith. Another example is Alistair Hinton's String Quintet (1969–77), which also includes a major part for solo soprano; at almost 170 minutes in duration, it is almost certainly the largest such work in the repertoire.

Slightly smaller string works with the double bass include six string sonatas by Gioachino Rossini, for two violins, cello, and double bass written at the age of twelve over the course of three days in 1804. These remain his most famous instrumental works and have also been adapted for wind quartet. Franz Anton Hoffmeister wrote four String Quartets for Solo Double Bass, Violin, Viola, and Cello in D Major. Frank Proto has written a Trio for Violin, Viola and Double Bass (1974), 2 Duos for Violin and Double Bass (1967 and 2005), and The Games of October for Oboe/English Horn and Double Bass (1991).

Larger works that incorporate the double bass include Beethoven's Septet in E major, Op. 20, one of his most famous pieces during his lifetime, which consists of clarinet, horn, bassoon, violin, viola, cello, and bass. When the clarinetist Ferdinand Troyer commissioned a work from Franz Schubert for similar forces, he added one more violin for his Octet in F major, D.803. Paul Hindemith used the same instrumentation as Schubert for his own Octet. In the realm of even larger works, Mozart included the double bass in addition to 12 wind instruments for his ""Gran Partita"" Serenade, K.361 and Martinů used the double bass in his nonet for wind quintet, violin, viola, cello and double bass.

Other examples of chamber works that use the double bass in mixed ensembles include Sergei Prokofiev's Quintet in G minor, Op. 39 for oboe, clarinet, violin, viola, and double bass; Miguel del Aguila's Malambo for bass flute and piano and for string quartet, bass and bassoon; Erwin Schulhoff's Concertino for flute/piccolo, viola, and double bass; Frank Proto's Afro-American Fragments for bass clarinet, cello, double bass and narrator and Sextet for clarinet and strings; Fred Lerdahl's Waltzes for violin, viola, cello, and double bass; Mohammed Fairouz's Litany for double bass and wind quartet; Mario Davidovsky's Festino for guitar, viola, cello, and double bass; and Iannis Xenakis's Morsima-Amorsima for piano, violin, cello, and double bass. There are also new music ensembles that utilize the double bass such as Time for Three and PROJECT Trio.

Orchestral passages and solos

In the baroque and classical periods, composers typically had the double bass double the cello part in orchestral passages. A notable exception is Haydn, who composed solo passages for the double bass in his Symphonies No. 6 Le Matin, No. 7 Le midi, No. 8 Le Soir, No. 31 Horn Signal, and No. 45 Farewell—but who otherwise grouped bass and cello parts together. Beethoven paved the way for separate double bass parts, which became more common in the romantic era. The scherzo and trio from Beethoven's Fifth Symphony are famous orchestral excerpts, as is the recitative at the beginning of the fourth movement of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. In many nineteenth century symphonies and concertos, the typical impact of separate bass and cello parts was that bass parts became simpler and cello parts got the melodic lines and rapid passage work.

A double bass section of a modern orchestra typically uses eight double bassists, usually in unison. Smaller orchestras may have four double basses, and in exceptional cases, bass sections may have as many as ten members. If some double bassists have low C extensions, and some have regular (low E) basses, those with the low C extensions may play some passages an octave below the regular double basses. Also, some composers write divided (divisi) parts for the basses, where upper and lower parts in the music are often assigned to ""outside"" (nearer the audience) and ""inside"" players. Composers writing divisi parts for bass often write perfect intervals, such as octaves and fifths, but in some cases use thirds and sixths.

Where a composition calls for a solo bass part, the principal bass invariably plays that part. The section leader (or principal) also determines the bowings, often based on bowings set out by the concertmaster. In some cases, the principal bass may use a slightly different bowing than the concertmaster, to accommodate the requirements of playing bass. The principal bass also leads entrances for the bass section, typically by lifting the bow or plucking hand before the entrance or indicating the entrance with the head, to ensure the section starts together. Major professional orchestras typically have an assistant principal bass player, who plays solos and leads the bass section if the principal is absent.

While orchestral bass solos are somewhat rare, there are some notable examples. Johannes Brahms, whose father was a double bass player, wrote many difficult and prominent parts for the double bass in his symphonies. Richard Strauss assigned the double bass daring parts, and his symphonic poems and operas stretch the instrument to its limits. ""The Elephant"" from Camille Saint-Saëns' The Carnival of the Animals is a satirical portrait of the double bass, and American virtuoso Gary Karr made his televised debut playing ""The Swan"" (originally written for the cello) with the New York Philharmonic conducted by Leonard Bernstein. The third movement of Gustav Mahler's first symphony features a solo for the double bass that quotes the children's song Frere Jacques, transposed into a minor key. Sergei Prokofiev's Lieutenant Kijé Suite features a difficult and very high double bass solo in the ""Romance"" movement. Benjamin Britten's The Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra contains a prominent passage for the double bass section.

Double bass ensembles
Ensembles made up entirely of double basses, though relatively rare, also exist, and several composers have written or arranged for such ensembles. Compositions for four double basses exist by Gunther Schuller, Jacob Druckman, James Tenney, Claus Kühnl, Robert Ceely, Jan Alm, Bernhard Alt, Norman Ludwin, Frank Proto, Joseph Lauber, Erich Hartmann, Colin Brumby, Miloslav Gajdos and Theodore Albin Findeisen. David A. Jaffe's ""Who's on First?"", commissioned by the Russian National Orchestra is scored for five double basses. Bertold Hummel wrote a Sinfonia piccola for eight double basses. Larger ensemble works include Galina Ustvolskaya's Composition No. 2, ""Dies Irae"" (1973), for eight double basses, piano, and wooden cube, José Serebrier's ""George and Muriel"" (1986), for solo bass, double bass ensemble, and chorus, and Gerhard Samuel's What of my music! (1979), for soprano, percussion, and 30 double basses.

Double bass ensembles include L'Orchestre de Contrebasses (6 members), Bass Instinct (6 members), Bassiona Amorosa (6 members), the Chicago Bass Ensemble (4+ members), Ludus Gravis founded by Daniele Roccato and Stefano Scodanibbio, The Bass Gang (4 members), the London Double Bass Ensemble (6 members) founded by members of the Philharmonia Orchestra of London who produced the LP Music Interludes by London Double Bass Ensemble on Bruton Music records, Brno Double Bass Orchestra (14 members) founded by the double bass professor at Janáček Academy of Music and Performing Arts and principal double bass player at Brno Philharmonic Orchestra – Miloslav Jelinek, and the ensembles of Ball State University (12 members), Shenandoah University, and the Hartt School of Music. The Amarillo Bass Base of Amarillo, Texas once featured 52 double bassists, and The London Double Bass Sound, who have released a CD on Cala Records, have 10 players.

In addition, the double bass sections of some orchestras perform as an ensemble, such as the Chicago Symphony Orchestra's Lower Wacker Consort. There is an increasing number of published compositions and arrangements for double bass ensembles, and the International Society of Bassists regularly features double bass ensembles (both smaller ensembles as well as very large ""mass bass"" ensembles) at its conferences, and sponsors the biennial David Walter Composition Competition, which includes a division for double bass ensemble works.

Use in jazz

Beginning around 1890, the early New Orleans jazz ensemble (which played a mixture of marches, ragtime, and Dixieland) was initially a marching band with a tuba or sousaphone (or occasionally bass saxophone) supplying the bass line. As the music moved into bars and brothels, the upright bass gradually replaced these wind instruments around the 1920s. Many early bassists doubled on both the brass bass (tuba) and string bass, as the instruments were then often referred to. Bassists played improvised ""walking"" bass lines—scale- and arpeggio-based lines that outlined the chord progression.

Because an unamplified upright bass is generally the quietest instrument in a jazz band, many players of the 1920s and 1930s used the slap style, slapping and pulling the strings to produce a rhythmic ""slap"" sound against the fingerboard. The slap style cuts through the sound of a band better than simply plucking the strings, and made the bass more easily heard on early sound recordings, as the recording equipment of that time did not favor low frequencies. For more about the slap style, see Modern playing styles, below.

Jazz bass players are expected to improvise an accompaniment line or solo for a given chord progression. They are also expected to know the rhythmic patterns that are appropriate for different styles (e.g., Afro-Cuban). Bassists playing in a big band must also be able to read written-out bass lines, as some arrangements have written bass parts.

Many upright bass players have contributed to the evolution of jazz. Examples include swing era players such as Jimmy Blanton, who played with Duke Ellington, and Oscar Pettiford, who pioneered the instrument's use in bebop. Paul Chambers (who worked with Miles Davis on the famous Kind of Blue album) achieved renown for being one of the first jazz bassists to play bebop solos with the bow. Terry Plumeri furthered the development of arco (bowed) solos, achieving horn-like technical freedom and a clear, vocal bowed tone, while Charlie Haden, best known for his work with Ornette Coleman, defined the role of the bass in Free Jazz.

A number of other bassists, such as Ray Brown, Slam Stewart and Niels-Henning Ørsted Pedersen, were central to the history of jazz. Stewart, who was popular with the beboppers, played his solos with a bow combined with octave humming.  Notably, Charles Mingus was a highly regarded composer as well as a bassist noted for his technical virtuosity and powerful sound. Scott LaFaro influenced a generation of musicians by liberating the bass from contrapuntal ""walking"" behind soloists instead favoring interactive, conversational melodies. Since the commercial availability of bass amplifiers in the 1950s, jazz bassists have used amplification to augment the natural volume of the instrument.

While the electric bass guitar was used intermittently in jazz as early as 1951, beginning in the 1970s bassist Bob Cranshaw, playing with saxophonist Sonny Rollins, and fusion pioneers Jaco Pastorius and Stanley Clarke began to commonly substitute the bass guitar for the upright bass. Apart from the jazz styles of jazz fusion and Latin-influenced jazz however, the upright bass is still the dominant bass instrument in jazz. The sound and tone of the plucked upright bass is distinct from that of the fretted bass guitar. The upright bass produces a different sound than the bass guitar, because its strings are not stopped by metal frets, instead having a continuous tonal range on the uninterrupted fingerboard. As well, bass guitars usually have a solid wood body, which means that their sound is produced by electronic amplification of the vibration of the strings, instead of the upright bass's acoustic reverberation.

Demonstrative examples of the sound of a solo double bass and its technical use in jazz can be heard on the solo recordings Emerald Tears (1978) by Dave Holland or Emergence (1986) by Miroslav Vitous. Holland also recorded an album with the representative title Music from Two Basses (1971) on which he plays with Barre Phillips while he sometimes switches to cello.

Use in bluegrass and country

The string bass is the most commonly used bass instrument in bluegrass music and is almost always plucked, though some modern bluegrass bassists have also used a bow. The bluegrass bassist is part of the rhythm section, and is responsible for keeping a steady beat, whether fast, slow, in ,  or  time.  The bass also maintains the chord progression and harmony. The Engelhardt-Link (formerly Kay) brands of plywood laminate basses have long been popular choices for bluegrass bassists. Most bluegrass bassists use the  size bass, but the full-size and  size basses are also used.

Early pre-bluegrass traditional music was often accompanied by the cello. The cellist Natalie Haas points out that in the US, you can find ""...old photographs, and even old recordings, of American string bands with cello"". However, ""The cello dropped out of sight in folk music, and became associated with the orchestra."" The cello did not reappear in bluegrass until the 1990s and first decade of the 21st century. Some contemporary bluegrass bands favor the electric bass, because it is easier to transport than the large and somewhat fragile upright bass. However, the bass guitar has a different musical sound. Many musicians feel the slower attack and percussive, woody tone of the upright bass gives it a more ""earthy"" or ""natural"" sound than an electric bass, particularly when gut strings are used.

Common rhythms in bluegrass bass playing involve (with some exceptions) plucking on beats 1 and 3 in  time; beats 1 and 2 in  time, and on the downbeat in  time (waltz time). Bluegrass bass lines are usually simple, typically staying on the root and fifth of each chord throughout most of a song. There are two main exceptions to this rule. Bluegrass bassists often do a diatonic walkup or walkdown, in which they play every beat of a bar for one or two bars, typically when there is a chord change. In addition, if a bass player is given a solo, they may play a walking bass line with a note on every beat or play a pentatonic scale-influenced bassline.

An early bluegrass bassist to rise to prominence was Howard Watts (also known as Cedric Rainwater), who played with Bill Monroe's Blue Grass Boys beginning in 1944. The classical bassist Edgar Meyer has frequently branched out into newgrass, old-time, jazz, and other genres.
""My all-time favorite is Todd Phillips"", proclaimed Union Station bassist Barry Bales in April 2005. ""He brought a completely different way of thinking about and playing bluegrass.

An upright bass was the standard bass instrument in traditional country western music. While the upright bass is still occasionally used in country music, the electric bass has largely replaced its bigger cousin in country music, especially in the more pop-infused country styles of the 1990s and 2000s, such as new country.

Slap-style bass
Slap-style bass is sometimes used in bluegrass bass playing. When bluegrass bass players slap the string by pulling it until it hits the fingerboard or hit the strings against the fingerboard, it adds the high-pitched percussive ""clack"" or ""slap"" sound to the low-pitched bass notes, sounding much like the clacks of a tap dancer. Slapping is a subject of minor controversy in the bluegrass scene. Even slapping experts such as Mike Bub say, ""Don't slap on every gig"", or in songs where it is not appropriate. As well, bluegrass bassists who play slap-style on live shows often slap less on records. Bub and his mentor Jerry McCoury rarely do slap bass on recordings. While bassists such as Jack Cook slap bass on the occasional faster ""Clinch Mountain Boys song"", bassists such as Gene Libbea, Missy Raines, Jenny Keel, and Barry Bales [rarely] slap bass.

Bluegrass bassist Mark Schatz, who teaches slap bass in his Intermediate Bluegrass Bass DVD acknowledges that slap bass ""...has not been stylistically very predominant in the music I have recorded"". He notes that ""Even in traditional bluegrass slap bass only appears sporadically and most of what I've done has been on the more contemporary side of that (Tony Rice, Tim O'Brien)."" Schatz states that he would be ""... more likely to use it [slap] in a live situation than on a recording—for a solo or to punctuate a particular place in a song or tune where I wouldn't be obliterating someone's solo"". Another bluegrass method, Learn to Play Bluegrass Bass, by Earl Gately, also teaches bluegrass slap bass technique. German bassist Didi Beck plays rapid triplet slaps, as demonstrated in this video.

Use in popular music

In the early 1950s, the upright bass was the standard bass instrument in the emerging style of rock and roll music, Marshall Lytle of Bill Haley & His Comets being but one example. In the 1940s, a new style of dance music called rhythm and blues developed, incorporating elements of the earlier styles of blues and swing. Louis Jordan, the first innovator of this style, featured an upright bass in his group, the Tympany Five.

The upright bass remained an integral part of pop lineups throughout the 1950s, as the new genre of rock and roll was built largely upon the model of rhythm and blues, with strong elements also derived from jazz, country, and bluegrass. However, upright bass players using their instruments in these contexts faced inherent problems. They were forced to compete with louder horn instruments (and later amplified electric guitars), making bass parts difficult to hear. The upright bass is difficult to amplify in loud concert venue settings, because it can be prone to feedback howls. As well, the upright bass is large and awkward to transport, which also created transportation problems for touring bands. In some groups, the slap bass was utilized as band percussion in lieu of a drummer; such was the case with Bill Haley & His Saddlemen (the forerunner group to the Comets), which did not use drummers on recordings and live performances until late 1952; prior to this the slap bass was relied on for percussion, including on recordings such as Haley's versions of ""Rock the Joint"" and ""Rocket 88"".

In 1951, Leo Fender released his Precision Bass, the first commercially successful electric bass guitar. The electric bass was easily amplified with its built-in magnetic pickups, easily portable (less than a foot longer than an electric guitar), and easier to play in tune than an upright bass, thanks to the metal frets. In the 1960s and 1970s bands were playing at louder volumes and performing in larger venues. The electric bass was able to provide the huge, highly amplified stadium-filling bass tone that the pop and rock music of this era demanded, and the upright bass receded from the limelight of the popular music scene.

The upright bass began making a comeback in popular music in the mid-1980s, in part due to a renewed interest in earlier forms of folk and country music, as part of the roots rock and Americana trends. In the 1990s, improvements in pickups and amplifier designs for electro-acoustic horizontal and upright basses made it easier for bassists to get a good, clear amplified tone from an acoustic instrument. Some popular bands decided to anchor their sound with an upright bass instead of an electric bass, such as the Barenaked Ladies. A trend for ""unplugged"" performances on MTV, in which rock bands performed with solely acoustic instruments, further helped to enhance the public's interest in the upright bass and acoustic bass guitars.

Jim Creeggan of Barenaked Ladies primarily plays upright bass, although he has increasingly played bass guitar throughout the band's career. Chris Wyse of alternative rock group Owl uses a combination of electric and double bass. Athol Guy of the Australian folk/pop group The Seekers plays an upright bass. Shannon Birchall, of the Australian folk-rock group The John Butler Trio, makes extensive use of upright basses, performing extended live solos in songs such as Betterman. On the 2008 album In Ear Park by the indie/pop band Department of Eagles, a bowed upright bass is featured quite prominently on the songs ""Teenagers"" and ""In Ear Park"". Norwegian ompa-rock band Kaizers Orchestra use the upright bass exclusively both live and on their recordings.

Hank Williams III's bass players (Jason Brown, Joe Buck and Zach Shedd, most notably) have used upright basses for recording as well as during the country and Hellbilly sets of Hank III's live performances before switching to electric bass for the Assjack set.

The late 1970s rockabilly-punk genre of psychobilly continued and expanded upon the rockabilly tradition of slap bass. Bassists such as Kim Nekroman and Geoff Kresge have developed the ability to play rapid slap bass that in effect turns the bass into a percussion instrument.

Modern playing styles

In popular music genres, the instrument is usually played with amplification and almost exclusively played with the fingers, pizzicato style. The pizzicato style varies between different players and genres. Some players perform with the sides of one, two, or three fingers, especially for walking basslines and slow tempo ballads, because this is purported to create a stronger and more solid tone. Some players use the more nimble tips of the fingers to play fast-moving solo passages or to pluck lightly for quiet tunes. The use of amplification allows the player to have more control over the tone of the instrument, because amplifiers have equalization controls that allow the bassist to accentuate certain frequencies (often the bass frequencies) while de-accentuating some frequencies (often the high frequencies, so that there is less finger noise).

An unamplified acoustic bass's tone is limited by the frequency responsiveness of the instrument's hollow body, which means that the very low pitches may not be as loud as the higher pitches. With an amplifier and equalization devices, a bass player can boost the low frequencies, which changes the frequency response. In addition, the use of an amplifier can increase the sustain of the instrument, which is particularly useful for accompaniment during ballads and for melodic solos with held notes.

In traditional jazz, swing, polka, rockabilly, and psychobilly music, it is sometimes played in the slap style. This is a vigorous version of pizzicato where the strings are ""slapped"" against the fingerboard between the main notes of the bass line, producing a snare drum-like percussive sound. The main notes are either played normally or by pulling the string away from the fingerboard and releasing it so that it bounces off the fingerboard, producing a distinctive percussive attack in addition to the expected pitch. Notable slap style bass players, whose use of the technique was often highly syncopated and virtuosic, sometimes interpolated two, three, four, or more slaps in between notes of the bass line.

""Slap style"" may have influenced electric bass guitar players  who, from the mid-sixties (particularly Larry Graham of Sly and the Family Stone), developed a technique called slap and pop that used the thumb of the plucking hand to hit the string, making a slapping sound but still letting the note ring, and the index or middle finger of the plucking hand to pull the string back so it hits the fretboard, achieving the pop sound described above. Motown bass player James Jamerson routinely used a double bass for enhancement of the electric bass in post-production (""sweetening"") of recorded tracks and vice versa in many instances.

Classical

Some of the most influential contemporary classical double bass players are known as much for their contributions to pedagogy as for their performing skills, such as US bassist Oscar G. Zimmerman (1910–1987), known for his teaching at the Eastman School of Music and, for 44 summers at the Interlochen National Music Camp in Michigan and French bassist François Rabbath (b. 1931) who developed a new bass method that divided the entire fingerboard into six positions. Bassists noted for their virtuoso solo skills include American pedagogue and performer Gary Karr (b. 1941), Finnish composer Teppo Hauta-Aho (b. 1941), Italian composer Fernando Grillo, and US player-composer Edgar Meyer. For a longer list, see the List of contemporary classical double bass players.

Jazz

Notable jazz bassists from the 1940s to the 1950s included bassist Jimmy Blanton (1918–1942) whose short tenure in the Duke Ellington Swing band (cut short by his death from tuberculosis) introduced new melodic and harmonic solo ideas for the instrument; bassist Ray Brown (1926–2002), known for backing Beboppers Dizzy Gillespie, Oscar Peterson, Art Tatum and Charlie Parker, and forming the Modern Jazz Quartet; hard bop bassist Ron Carter (born 1937), who has appeared on 3,500 albums make him one of the most-recorded bassists in jazz history, including LPs by Thelonious Monk and Wes Montgomery and many Blue Note Records artists; and Paul Chambers (1935–1969), a member of the Miles Davis Quintet (including the landmark modal jazz recording Kind of Blue) and many other 1950s and 1960s rhythm sections, was known for his virtuosic improvisations.

The experimental post 1960s era, and free jazz and jazz-rock fusion, produced several influential bassists. Charles Mingus (1922–1979), who was also a composer and bandleader, produced music that fused hard bop with black gospel music, free jazz, and classical music. Free jazz and post-bop bassist Charlie Haden (1937–2014) is best known for his long association with saxophonist Ornette Coleman, and for his role in the 1970s-era Liberation Music Orchestra, an experimental group. Eddie Gómez and George Mraz, who played with Bill Evans and Oscar Peterson, respectively, and are both acknowledged to have furthered expectations of pizzicato fluency and melodic phrasing. Fusion virtuoso Stanley Clarke (born 1951) is notable for his dexterity on both the upright bass and the electric bass. Terry Plumeri is noted for his horn-like arco fluency and vocal-sounding tone.

In the 1990s and first decade of the 21st century, one of the new ""young lions"" was Christian McBride (born 1972), who has performed with a range of veterans ranging from McCoy Tyner to fusion gurus Herbie Hancock and Chick Corea, and who has released albums such as 2003's Vertical Vision. Another young bassist of note is Esperanza Spalding (born 1984) who, at 27 years of age, had already won a Grammy for Best New Artist.

Other popular genres

In addition to being a noted classical player, Edgar Meyer is well known in bluegrass and newgrass circles. Todd Phillips is another prominent bluegrass player. Well-known rockabilly bassists include Bill Black, Marshall Lytle (with Bill Haley & His Comets) and Lee Rocker (with 1980s-era rockabilly revivalists the Stray Cats).

Notable rockabilly revivalists and psychobilly performers from the 1990s and first decade of the 21st century include Scott Owen (from the Australian band The Living End), Jimbo Wallace (from the US band Reverend Horton Heat), Kim Nekroman (Nekromantix), Patricia Day (HorrorPops), Geoff Kresge (Tiger Army, ex-AFI). Willie Dixon (1915–1992) was one of the most notable figures in the history of rhythm and blues. In addition to being an upright bassist, he wrote dozens of R&B hits and worked as a producer. He also plays bass on numerous Chuck Berry's rock and roll hits. Many other rockabilly bands like El Rio Trio (from the Netherlands) also use this instrument in their work. See also the List of double bassists in popular music.

Pedagogy and training
The pedagogy and training for the double bass varies widely by genre and country. Classical double bass has a history of pedagogy dating back several centuries, including teaching manuals, studies, and progressive exercises that help students to develop the endurance and accuracy of the left hand, and control for the bowing hand. Classical training methods vary by country: many of the major European countries are associated with specific methods (e.g., the Edouard Nanny method in France or the Franz Simandl method in Germany). In classical training, the majority of the instruction for the right hand focuses on the production of bowing tone; little time is spent studying the varieties of pizzicato tone.

In contrast, in genres that mainly or exclusively use pizzicato (plucking), such as jazz and blues, a great deal of time and effort is focused on learning the varieties of different pizzicato styles used for music of different styles of tempi. For example, in jazz, aspiring bassists have to learn how to perform a wide range of pizzicato tones, including using the sides of the fingers to create a full, deep sound for ballads, using the tips of the fingers for fast walking basslines or solos, and performing a variety of percussive ghost notes by raking muted or partially muted strings.

Formal training

Of all of the genres, classical and jazz have the most established and comprehensive systems of instruction and training. In the classical milieu, children can begin taking private lessons on the instrument and performing in children's or youth orchestras. Teens who aspire to becoming professional classical bassists can continue their studies in a variety of formal training settings, including colleges, conservatories, and universities. Colleges offer certificates and diplomas in bass performance.

Conservatories, which are the standard musical training system in France and in Quebec (Canada) provide lessons and amateur orchestral experience for double bass players. Universities offer a range of double bass programs, including bachelor's degrees, Master of Music degrees, and Doctor of Musical Arts degrees. As well, there are a variety of other training programs such as classical summer camps and orchestral, opera, or chamber music training festivals, which give students the opportunity to play a wide range of music.

Bachelor's degrees in bass performance (referred to as B.Mus. or B.M.) are four-year programs that include individual bass lessons, amateur orchestra experience, and a sequence of courses in music history, music theory, and liberal arts courses (e.g., English literature), which give the student a more well-rounded education. Usually, bass performance students perform several recitals of solo double bass music, such as concertos, sonatas, and Baroque suites.

Master of music degrees (M.mus.) in double bass performance consist of private lessons, ensemble experience, coaching in playing orchestral double bass parts, and graduate courses in music history and music theory, along with one or two solo recitals. A Master's degree in music (referred to as an M.Mus. or M.M.) is often a required credential for people who wish to become a professor of double bass at a university or conservatory.

Doctor of Musical Arts (referred to as D.M.A., DMA, D.Mus.A. or A.Mus.D.) degrees in double bass performance provide an opportunity for advanced study at the highest artistic and pedagogical level, requiring usually an additional 54+ credit hours beyond a master's degree (which is about 30+ credits beyond a bachelor's degree). For this reason, admission is highly selective. Examinations in music history, music theory, ear training/dictation, and an entrance examination-recital, are required. Students perform a number of recitals (around six), including a lecture-recital with an accompanying doctoral dissertation, advanced coursework, and a minimum B average are other typical requirements of a D.M.A. program.

Throughout the early history of jazz, double bass players either learned the instrument informally, or from getting classical training early on, as in the case of Ron Carter and Charles Mingus. In the 1980s and 1990s, colleges and universities began to introduce diplomas and degrees in jazz performance. Students in jazz diploma or Bachelor of Music programs take individual bass lessons, get experience in small jazz combos with coaching from an experienced player, and play in jazz big bands. As with classical training programs, jazz programs also include classroom courses in music history and music theory. In a jazz program, these courses focus on the different eras of jazz history. such as Swing, Bebop, and fusion. The theory courses focus on the musical skills used in jazz improvisation and in jazz comping (accompanying) and the composition of jazz tunes. There are also jazz summer camps and training festivals/seminars, which offer students the chance to learn new skills and styles.

Informal training
In other genres, such as blues, rockabilly, and psychobilly, the pedagogical systems and training sequences are not as formalized and institutionalized. There are not degrees in blues bass performance, or conservatories offering multiple-year diplomas in rockabilly bass. However, there are a range of books, playing methods, and, since the 1990s, instructional DVDs (e.g., on how to play rockabilly-style slap bass). As such, performers in these other genres tend to come from a variety of routes, including informal learning by using bass method books or DVDs, taking private lessons and coaching, and learning from records and CDs. In some cases, blues or rockabilly bassists may have obtained some initial training through the classical or jazz pedagogy systems (e.g., youth orchestra or high school big band). In genres such as tango, which use a lot of bowed passages and jazz-style pizzicato lines, the bassists tend to come from classical or jazz training routes.

Careers
Careers in double bass vary widely by genre and by region or country. Most bassists earn their living from a mixture of performance and teaching jobs. The first step to getting most performance jobs is by playing at an audition. In some styles of music, such as jazz-oriented stage bands, bassists may be asked to sight read printed music or perform standard pieces (e.g., a jazz standard such as Now's the Time) with an ensemble. Similarly, in a rock or blues band, auditionees may be asked to play various rock or blues standards. An upright bassist auditioning for a blues band might be asked to play in a Swing-style walking bassline, a rockabilly-style ""slapping"" bassline (in which the strings are percussively struck against the fingerboard) and a 1950s ballad with long held notes. A person auditioning for a role as a bassist in some styles of pop or rock music may be expected to demonstrate the ability to perform harmony vocals as a backup singer. In some pop and rock groups, the bassist may be asked to play other instruments from time to time, such as electric bass, keyboards or acoustic guitar. The ability to play electric bass is widely expected in country groups, in case the band is performing a classic rock or new country song.

Classical music
In classical music, bassists audition for playing jobs in orchestras and for admission into university or Conservatory programs or degrees. At a classical bass audition, the performer typically plays a movement from a J.S. Bach suite for solo cello or a movement from a bass concerto and a variety of excerpts from the orchestral literature. The excerpts are typically the most technically challenging parts of bass parts and bass solos from the orchestral literature. Some of the most commonly requested orchestral excerpts at bass auditions are from Beethoven's Symphonies Nos. 5, 7 and 9; Strauss's Ein Heldenleben and Don Juan; Mozart's Symphonies Nos. 35, 39 and 40; Brahms' Symphonies Nos. 1 and 2; Stravinsky's Pulcinella; Shostakovich's Symphony No. 5; Ginastera's Variaciones Concertante; Tchaikovsky's Symphony No. 4; Mahler's Symphony No. 2; J. S. Bach's Suite No. 2 in B; Berlioz's Symphonie Fantastique, Mendelssohn's Symphony No. 4; and the bass solos from Verdi's opera Otello, Mahler's Symphony No. 1, Britten's The Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra and Prokofiev's Lieutenant Kije Suite.

9170,"['me to did saint your what guess , Well "" , said I and , him defending started mother My ?']","Sandra Dee (born Alexandra Zuck; April 23, 1942 – February 20, 2005) was an American actress. Dee began her career as a child model, working first in commercials, and then film in her teenage years. Best known for her portrayal of  ingénues, Dee earned a Golden Globe Award as one of the year's most promising newcomers for her performance in Robert Wise's Until They Sail (1958). She became a teenage star for her performances in Imitation of Life and Gidget (both 1959), which made her a household name.

By the late 1960s, her career had started to decline, and a highly publicized marriage to Bobby Darin ended in divorce. The year of her divorce, Dee's contract with Universal Pictures was dropped. She attempted a comeback with the 1970 independent horror film The Dunwich Horror, but rarely acted after this time, appearing only occasionally in television productions throughout the 1970s and early 1980s. The rest of the decade was marred by alcoholism, mental illness, plus near total reclusiveness, particularly after her mother died in 1988. Afterwards she sought medical and psychological help in the early 1990s, and died in 2005 of complications from kidney disease, brought on by a lifelong struggle with anorexia nervosa.

Life and career

1942–1951: Early life
Dee was born Alexandra Zuck on April 23, 1942 in Bayonne, New Jersey, the only child of John Zuck and Mary (née Cymboliak) Zuck, who met as teenagers at a Russian Orthodox Church dance. They married shortly afterward, but divorced before Dee was five years old. She was of Carpatho-Rusyn ancestry and raised in the Orthodox faith; her son Dodd Darin wrote in his biographical book about his parents titled Dream Lovers that Dee's mother Mary and her aunt Olga ""were first generation daughters of a working-class Russian Orthodox couple,"" and Dee recalled, ""we belonged to a Russian Orthodox church, and there was dancing at the social events."" She soon adopted the name Sandra Dee, becoming a professional model by the age of four and progressing to television commercials.

There has been some dispute as to Dee's actual birth year, with evidence pointing to both 1942 and 1944. Legal records, including her California divorce record from Bobby Darin, as well as the Social Security Death Index and her own gravestone all give her year of birth as 1942. In a 1967 interview with the Oxnard Press-Courier, she acknowledged being 18 in 1960 when she first met Darin, whom she wed three months later. According to her son's book, Dee was born in 1944, but, having begun modeling and acting at a very young age, she and her mother falsely inflated her age by two years in order that she could find more work. Dee's parents divorced in 1950, and her mother then married a man who had been sexually abusing Dee and continued to do so after he married her mother.

1952–1956: Modeling career
Producer Ross Hunter claimed to have discovered Dee on Park Avenue in New York City with her mother when she was 12 years old. In a 1959 interview, Dee recalled that she ""grew up fast,"" surrounded mostly by older people, and was ""never held back in anything [she] wanted to do.""

During her modeling career, Dee attempted to lose weight to ""be as skinny as the high-fashion models,"" although an improper diet ""ruined [her] skin, hair, nails—everything."" Having lost weight, her body was unable to digest any food that she ate, and it took the help of a doctor to regain her health. According to Dee, she ""could have killed [herself]"" and ""had to learn to eat all over again."" In spite of the damaging effects on her health, Dee earned $75,000 in 1956 () working as a child model in New York, which she used to support herself and her mother after the death of her stepfather in 1956. According to sources, Dee's large modeling salary was more than that which she would later earn as an actress. While modeling in New York, she attended the Professional Children's School.

1957–1958: Early films and Universal contract
Ending her modeling career, Dee moved from New York to Hollywood in 1957. She graduated from University High School in Los Angeles in June 1958. Dee's onscreen debut was in the 1957 MGM film Until They Sail, directed by Robert Wise. To promote the film, Dee appeared in a December issue of Modern Screen in a column by Louella Parsons, who praised Dee and compared her appearance and talent to those of Shirley Temple. Dee's performance made her one of that year's winners of the Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year – Actress.

MGM cast Dee as the female lead in The Reluctant Debutante (1958), with John Saxon as her romantic costar. It was the first of several films in which Dee appeared with Saxon. She provided the voice of Gerda for the English dub of The Snow Queen (1957). With her newfound success and the effects of sexual abuse, Dee continued to struggle with anorexia nervosa, and her kidneys temporarily failed.

In 1958, Dee signed with Universal Pictures and was one of the company's last contract players prior to the dissolution of the studio system. She had a lead role in The Restless Years (1958) for producer Ross Hunter, opposite Saxon and Teresa Wright. She followed this with another film for Hunter, A Stranger in My Arms (1959).

1959–1965: Stardom

Dee's third film for Hunter was of greater impact than the first two: Imitation of Life (1959), opposite Lana Turner. The film became a box-office success, grossing more than $50 million. It was the highest-grossing film in Universal's history and made Dee a household name. She was loaned to Columbia Pictures to play the title role in the teenage beach comedy Gidget (1959), which was a solid hit, helping spawn the beach party genre and leading to two sequels, two television series and two television movies (although Dee did not appear in any of these).

Universal next cast Dee as a tomboy opposite Audie Murphy in the Western romantic comedy The Wild and the Innocent (1959). Warner Bros. borrowed her for another melodrama in the vein of Imitation of Life, A Summer Place (1959), opposite Troy Donahue as her romantic costar. The film was a massive hit, and that year American box office exhibitors voted Dee the 16th-most popular star in the country.

Hunter reunited Dee with Turner and Saxon in Universal's Portrait in Black (1960), a thriller that was a financial success despite receiving harsh reviews. Dee was listed as the nation's seventh-greatest star at the end of 1960. Peter Ustinov cast her as the lead in the Cold War comedy Romanoff and Juliet (1961) with Universal's new heartthrob John Gavin, reuniting them from Imitation of Life.

Dee and Gavin played together again in Hunter's popular Tammy Tell Me True (1961), in which Dee took the Tammy role originated by Debbie Reynolds. In Come September (1961), she worked with Bobby Darin in his film debut (following a cameo in an earlier film). Dee and Darin married after filming on December 1, 1960. On December 16, 1961, she gave birth to their son Dodd Mitchell Darin (also known as Morgan Mitchell Darin).

In 1961, Dee, with three years remaining on her Universal contract, signed a new one for seven years. Dee and Darin appeared together in the Hunter romantic comedy If a Man Answers (1962). In 1963, she appeared in the final Tammy film, Tammy and the Doctor, and the hit comedy Take Her, She's Mine, playing a character loosely based on Nora Ephron. That year, she was voted the eighth-greatest star in the country, but it was her last appearance in the top 10. Dee appeared n I'd Rather Be Rich (1964), a musical remake of It Started with Eve, once again for Hunter. She was reunited with Darin in That Funny Feeling (1965) before appearing in her last film at Universal under her contract with the spy comedy A Man Could Get Killed (1966).

Dee was also a singer and recorded some singles in the early 1960s, including a cover version of ""When I Fall in Love.""

1966–1983: Career decline and later roles

By the end of the 1960s, Dee's career had slowed significantly, and she was dropped by Universal Pictures. She rarely acted following her 1967 divorce from Darin. In a 1967 interview with Roger Ebert, she reflected on her experience in the studio system and on the ingénue image that had been foisted on her, which she found constricting:Look at this––[a] cigarette. I like to smoke. I'm 25 years old, and it so happens that I like to smoke. So out in Hollywood the studio press agents are still pulling cigarettes out of my hand and covering my drink with a napkin whenever my picture is taken. Little Sandra Dee isn't supposed to smoke, you know. Or drink. Or breathe.

Dee appeared in the somewhat successful Doctor, You've Got to Be Kidding! in 1967. Hunter asked her to return to Universal in a co-starring role in Rosie! (1967), but the film was not a success. Dee was inactive in the film industry for several years before appearing in the 1970 American International Pictures occult horror film The Dunwich Horror—a loose adaptation of an H.P. Lovecraft story—as a college student who finds herself in the center of an occult ritual plot. Dee later said, ""The reason I decided to do Dunwich was because I couldn't put the script down once I started reading it. I had read so many that I had to plow through, just because I promised someone. Even if this movie turns out be a complete disaster, I guarantee it will change my image."" However, she refused to appear nude in the film's final sequence that had been written in the screenplay.

Throughout the 1970s, Dee took sporadic guest-starring roles on episodes of several television series, such as Night Gallery, Fantasy Island and Police Woman. Her final film performance occurred in the low-budget drama Lost (1983). In her later years, Dee told a newspaper that she ""felt like a has-been that never was.""

1984–2005: Later life and retirement
Dee's years in the 1980s were marked by poor health, and she became a self-described recluse after retiring from acting. At one point, she finally confronted her mother about the sexual abuse by her stepfather when she was a child, as well as her mother's obliviousness to it. She said: 
One night I couldn't control the pressure any longer. My mother and I were at home with a few of her close friends, and she started eulogizing my stepfather. I was slowly getting more and more irate. Finally I said, ""Mom, shut up. A saint he wasn't."" My mother started defending him, and I said, ""Well, guess what your saint did to me? He had sex with me."" My mother was shocked, then angry. I knew I hurt her. I wanted to. I had so much anger toward her for not doing something to help me. But she ignored me, and the subject never came up again. I realize now that my mother erased the abuse from her own mind. It didn't exist, so she didn't have to feel guilty.

Dee battled anorexia nervosa, depression and alcoholism for many years, hitting a low point in 1988 when her mother died of lung cancer. Dee stated that for months she became a recluse living on soup, crackers and scotch, with her body weight falling to only 80 pounds. After she began to vomit blood, her son compelled her to seek medical and psychiatric treatment. Her mental and physical condition improved, and she expressed a desire to appear in a television situation comedy, partly in order to belong to a family. She stopped drinking altogether after she was diagnosed with kidney failure in 2000, which was attributed to years of heavy drinking and smoking.
 
In 1994's Dream Lovers: The Magnificent Shattered Lives of Bobby Darin and Sandra Dee, Dodd Darin chronicled his mother's anorexia and drug and alcohol problems, stating that she had been sexually abused as a child by her stepfather Eugene Douvan. The same year, Dee's final acting credit occurred with a voice-only appearance on an episode of Frasier.

Death

After requiring kidney dialysis for the last four years of her life, complications from kidney disease led to Dee's death on February 20, 2005 at the Los Robles Hospital & Medical Center in Thousand Oaks, California at the age of 62. She was interred in a crypt at Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in the Hollywood Hills.

9382,"[""Charley 's Where ?"", ""Charley 's Where ?""]","Ernest Harold Martin (born Ernest Harold Markowitz; August 28, 1919 – May 7, 1995) was an American Broadway producer who wrote the book for a musical, owned a Broadway theater and produced motion pictures, including Guys and Dolls, How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying, A Chorus Line and Cabaret (1972 film nominated for 10 Oscars). Best known for such hits as Guys and Dolls, How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying, and Cabaret, Martin left his mark on American and international theatre and screen.

Life and career
Martin, singly or with Cy Feuer, was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Musical five times with Walking Happy (1967); Skyscraper (1966), Little Me (1963); How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying (1962), and Guys and Dolls (1951). Little Me and How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying also garnered them nominations for the Tony Award for Best Producer of a Musical. How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying and Guys and Dolls won the Tony Award for Best Musical, while ""Business"" also won the Best Producer Tony and the Pulitzer Prize. Feuer and Martin owned the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre from 1960 to 1965. They were so successful as producers on Broadway that they were dubbed ""The Golddust Twins.""

Martin managed the Los Angeles Civic Light Opera from 1976 to 1980 as well as its sister Civic Light Opera in San Francisco, bringing Broadway shows to the west coast and creating and cultivating new shows (such as Liza Minnelli's The Act) prior to taking them to Broadway NY Times Obituary Ernest H. Martin Dies. Ernest H. Martin was a master at conceptualization and initiator of many Broadway and film classics, while his partner Cy Feuer, was a master at directing and executing on the ideas. Feuer was known to say, ""Ernie was the sparkplug and I was the engineer"" 

He graduated from UCLA, where he was elected president of the senior class. He began his career at CBS radio, where he quickly rose to the position of head of programming. He was married three times, twice to women named Nancy, and his third wife was Twyla Martin.

9396,"['this express to else how , bit a but , weary - world not , or weary - world bit a \'s it say would I "" , song the of said Jackson , 2011 in Club ?']","""Be My Number Two"" is a song by British singer-songwriter and musician Joe Jackson, which was released in 1984 as the third and final single from his sixth studio album Body and Soul. It was written by Jackson, and produced by Jackson and David Kershenbaum. ""Be My Number Two"" reached No. 70 in the UK and remained in the charts for four weeks.

Background
Speaking to The A.V. Club in 2011, Jackson said of the song, ""I would say it's a bit world-weary or, not world-weary, but a bit, how else to express this? Once bitten, twice shy. It's saying, 'Well, let's try again, but it's not going to be like it was the first time.' So it's poignant, I think.""

Critical reception
On its release as a single, Jerry Smith of Music Week wrote, ""A slow ballad sung with feeling, mainly accompanied by piano until the band come in at the end with a warm fluid sax picking out the melody."" Colin Davidson of the Evening Express described it as a ""great choice as a single"" and ""poignant songwriting at its very best"". Frank Edmonds of the Bury Free Press gave the song an 8 out of 10 rating and described it as a ""quiet, plaintive, thoughtful and extremely attractive love ballad"".

Sunie of Number One commented, ""This is a pretty enough song, all tinkling piano and sad, cynical words. But it's not aimed at you or me. Divorce-scarred, mid-life Americans should lap it up."" Billboard noted, ""A quiet tune, except for the rousing finish; just Jackson, piano, and a tone of bewildered pathos.""

In a review of Body and Soul, The Absolute Sound stated, ""'Be My Number Two' is a song worthy of Jackson, a maybe-cynical, maybe-wise love song with a bit of hard-edged Fifties feel. This is the kind of song Jackson has always done well."" The New Rolling Stone Album Guide of 2004 described the song as one which ""hark[s] back to the incisive cynicism of Jackson's breakthrough albums"".

9403,"['Dipahamkan Harus Tauchid dan , Tawakal , Takdir Bagaimana titled book religious a wrote he , 1953 In ?']","Haji Agus Salim (; October 8, 1884 – November 4, 1954) was an Indonesian journalist, diplomat, and statesman. He served as Indonesia's Minister of Foreign Affairs between 1947 and 1949.

Early life
Agus Salim was born Masjhoedoelhaq Salim on October 8, 1884, in the village of Koto Gadang, a suburb of Fort de Kock. His father, Sutan Mohammad Salim, was a colonial prosecutor and judge whose highest rank was chief judge for the indigenous court in Tanjung Pinang. His birth name, which translates into ""defender of truth"", was changed into Agus Salim early in his childhood.

Salim received his elementary education at Europeesche Lagere School; at that time, it was considered a privilege for a non-European child to attend an all-European school. He continued his studies at the Hogere Burgerschool in Batavia, and graduated with the highest score in the whole Dutch East Indies. Salim's father had applied (and was granted) for his two sons, Agus and Jacob, to be granted equal status with the Europeans. However, his efforts to secure a government scholarship to study medicine in the Netherlands fell short. Kartini, another European-educated student whose writings on women's rights and emancipation became famous later, offered to defer her own scholarship for Salim; this, too, was rejected.

C.S. Hurgronje, a prominent colonial administrator best known for his study of native affairs, took Salim under his wing and arranged for him to leave the Indies in 1905 to work as an interpreter and secretary at the Dutch consulate in Jeddah, where he handled hajj affairs; in some way, it was to distance him from the radical teachings of a close relative, the well-known Shafi'i imam of Masjid al-Haram Ahmad Khatib al-Minangkabawi.

Salim returned to the Indies in 1911 and pursued a career in journalism, contributing pieces for magazines and publications like Hindia Baroe, Fadjar Asia, and Moestika. He would later serve as an editor in Neratja, a newspaper aligned with the Sarekat Islam, where he was also an active member. While in that, he founded a private Hollandsche Indische School in his hometown of Koto Gadang, but left after three years to return to Java.

Political activism 
Salim became one of the most vocal advocates of the growing Indonesian nationalist movement, in the period known as the national awakening. He became a prominent leader in the Sarekat Islam and was considered a right-hand man of its leader, Oemar Said Tjokroaminoto. The SI contained many political strains, including communists, business leaders and Islamically-minded reformers. Having spent time in the Hejaz, Salim was considered to be on the reformist side of the SI and was at odds with the increasingly leftist faction of SI led by Semaun, Tan Malaka, and Darsono; who would eventually break with SI to found the Communist Union of the Indies.

Salim was occasionally accused by those leftists of being too close to the Dutch colonial government. First, his newspaper Neratja had been funded in 1917 with government money (under the direction of Governor General Johan Paul van Limburg Stirum) who wanted a Malay-language forum for perspectives sympathetic to the Dutch Ethical Policy, However, by 1918 Neratja became a harsh critic of the colonial government, regularly printing reports of mistreatment of Muslims in remote regions of the Indies. Nonetheless, allegations continued to surface from the left. The Dutch communist Henk Sneevliet accused Neratja editor Abdul Muis of having advocated for his expulsion from the Indies in 1917. And when Salim's Neratja was the only Malay language newspaper to applaud his expulsion in 1918, its editors were condemned by other newspapers and forced to apologize.  Even in the late 1920s, as many communists in the Indies were being sent to concentration camps in Boven Digoel, disputes were still arising over Salim's behavior in 1917. In 1927 Bintang Timoer published allegations that Agus Salim had joined Sarekat Islam and other meetings in the 1910s and delivered reports to government officials and then used government money to criticize communists in Neratja.  Salim responded that he had needed money to continue his activities, and that everyone profited from the government in some way or other.

Later, after the breakup of the Sarekat Islam, Salim (along with Tjokroaminoto) co-founded the Islamic Union Party (Partai Serikat Islam, PSI), later became PSII. After Tjokro's death in 1934, Salim became the party's intellectual leader.

In 1921, Salim was appointed to the Volksraad, the Indies' mainly symbolic and advisory quasi-legislature, representing Sarekat Islam. Despite being a proficient speaker of the Dutch language, he insisted to deliver his speeches in Malay, the first member of the council to do so despite hostile reception from other European members. He left the chamber in 1924, frustrated by the chamber's powerlessness (its main function is indeed to solely give advices to the Governor-General) and derided it as just a mere komedi omong (talking comedy).

Being an outspoken advocate of social change within Indonesian Islamic community, Salim was widely known for his unorthodoxy on social issues. At the 1927 convention of national Islamic organization Jong Islamieten Bond (JIB) in Surakarta, Salim ripped apart the curtained divider between men's and women's seating area, and proceeded to deliver his speech titled  (""On Veiling and Separation of Women"").

Another area of activism that Salim was active was labour's welfare. At request of prominent Dutch trade union Nederlands Verbond van Vakverenigingen (NVV), he served as an advisor for its delegation to the 1929 and 1930 International Labour Convention, both times in Geneva, Switzerland.

It was alleged that throughout his early years returning from Jeddah, Salim had been in contact or possibly working for the Politieke Inlichtingen Dienst (PID), the Dutch East Indies's principal state security and intelligence service. Allan Akbar, a historian, conceded that Salim had been asked for a favour by Datuak Tumangguang, a prominent Minangkabau advisor to the colonial government, to covertly enter Sarekat Islam, especially to investigate the relationship between Tjokroaminoto and the Germans. For six weeks, Salim investigated the Sarekat from within, but in a strange twist of history, decided to join the organization in his own will.

Japanese occupation 
During the waning years of Dutch rule and early years of Japanese occupation, Salim retired from active politics and was involved in several trades. Unlike most of the future Republican leaders, Salim was never arrested nor exiled, probably owing from his vast connections with the colonial bureaucracy or his rumored services for the colonial intelligence services.

In 1943, the Japanese military government asked Salim, a renowned polyglot who speak nine languages, to compile a military dictionary for the use of Pembela Tanah Air, the newly-formed volunteer militia prepared for an impending invasion of the Allied forces. Salim found his way back to politics, being appointed to advise the Indonesian leaders (Sukarno, Mohammad Hatta, Ki Hajar Dewantara, and Mas Mansyur) who is in charge of the Pusat Tenaga Rakyat (""Center for People's Power"", Putera), an intellectual body set up by Japanese government to mobilize popular support for war efforts.

Indonesian independence 

Salim was appointed to the Investigating Committee for Preparatory Work for Independence (Badan Penyelidik Usaha-usaha Persiapan Kemerdekaan Indonesia, BPUPK) in March 1945.

On June 1, Salim was appointed to a Committee of Nine (Panitia Sembilan) tasked to draft the basis of the state. In the committee chaired by Sukarno, Salim was one of the prominent Muslim leaders alongside Wahid Hasyim and Abdul Kahar Muzakir. One of the issue that must be tackled by the committee was to find a compromise between the secular nationalist bloc, which demanded a secular state; with the Islamist bloc, which argued that being a Muslim-majority nation, an independent Indonesia should be based on Islamic principles.

The committee would end up with the Jakarta Charter, which includes Sukarno's proposed Pancasila as official state philosophy and an explicit call for Muslim Indonesians to oblige to the sharia (ketuhanan dengan kewajiban menjalankan syariat Islam bagi pemeluk-pemeluknya). BPUPK as a whole ratified it on July 10. On July 11, Salim was appointed to sit in the Subcommittee for Constitutional Drafting (Panitia Kecil Perancang Undang-Undang Dasar), again chaired by Sukarno. He was highly influential on the early drafting of the constitution and was seen as a respected mediator during heated confrontations.

On August 7, the BPUPK was dissolved and replaced with the Preparatory Committee for Indonesian Independence (Panitia Persiapan Kemerdekaan Indonesia, PPKI). For unclear reasons, however, Salim did not sit in committee; he was also not recorded of being present during the independence proclamation at Sukarno's residence on August 17.

Government and diplomatic services 

Salim did not join the first Indonesian cabinet; Sukarno, now President of the Republic, appointed him to the newly-created Supreme Advisory Council (Dewan Pertimbangan Agung, DPA). He remained in that position until March 1946, when he was appointed Deputy Foreign Minister (Menteri Muda Luar Negeri) under Foreign Minister and Prime Minister Sutan Sjahrir of the Socialist Party. He reprised that role in the third Sjahrir Cabinet before being promoted as Foreign Minister in the first Amir Sjarifuddin Cabinet in July 1947; Amir, like Sjahrir, is a Socialist.

As Deputy Foreign Minister, Salim led numerous Indonesian diplomatic missions abroad. He led the Indonesian delegation in the Asian Relations Conference in New Delhi from March to April 1947. The same month, he led a small party consisting of Abdurrahman Baswedan, Rasjidi, and Nazir Sutan Pamuncak to seek diplomatic recognition from Arab states. A fluent speaker of classical (fusha) Arabic, Salim met with Mahmoud El Nokrashy Pasha, the Egyptian prime minister, and Abdul Rahman Hassan Azzam, the secretary-general of the Arab League. For the next three months, Salim and his delegation successfully gained diplomatic recognition from almost all members of the League.

In August 1947, Salim with Sjahrir traveled to the United States to participate in a United Nations Security Council session in Lake Success, New York. With help of banker Margono Djojohadikusumo (grandfather of Prabowo Subianto), the two breached Dutch naval blockade with a plane carrying contraband vanilla to Singapore. Returning home, Salim was part of the Indonesian delegation throughout negotiations aboard USS Renville, which led to an agreement that temporarily reduced tensions after the breaking down of the previous Linggadjati Agreement. During the negotiations, Salim's personal friendship with the Dutch chief negotiator Abdulkadir Widjojoatmodjo (a KNIL high-ranking officer whom he had worked with in the Dutch consulate in Jeddah) helped to smoothen the process.

Salim remained in charge of foreign affairs in the first Hatta Cabinet, while officially serving ad interim. When Dutch started a military offensive called Operatie Kraai, in December 1948 , he was one of the Republican leaders exiled from the capital, Yogyakarta. Alongside Sjahrir and Sukarno, Salim was first exiled to Berastagi in North Sumatera before transferred to Parapat. With the rest of the leaders, Salim returned to Yogya and reclaimed his duties as foreign minister in the second Hatta Cabinet, having been briefly exercised by Sjafruddin Prawiranegara ex officio with his duties as Chairman of the Emergency Government of the Republic in its only cabinet from December 1948 to July 1949.

One of Salim's final diplomatic service was as part of the Indonesian delegation in the Dutch–Indonesian Round Table Conference in The Hague on late 1949. Hatta's second cabinet was dissolved in December 1949 and the United States of Indonesia was formed. Hatta, the United States' inaugural (and only) premier and foreign minister, appointed Salim to be a special advisor on foreign affairs. The United States itself was dissolved in September 1950.

Later life and death 
After leaving government service, Salim returned to writing and journalism. In 1952, he was appointed to the honorary board of Association of Indonesian Journalists (Persatuan Wartawan Indonesia, PWI). In 1953, he wrote a religious book titled Bagaimana Takdir, Tawakal, dan Tauchid Harus Dipahamkan? (""How Should Tawakkul, Taqdir, and Tawhid Be Understood?""); later editions saw it updated as Keterangan Filsafat Tentang Takdir, Tawakal, dan Tauchid (""Philosophical Addresses on Tawakkul, Taqdir, and Tawhid"").

On spring of 1953, Salim and his wife lived for six months in Ithaca, New York, where he delivered guest lectures at Cornell University. His lectures were later compiled and published as Pesan-Pesan Islam: Rangkaian Kuliah Musim Semi 1953 di Cornell University, Amerika Serikat.

Salim died on November 4, 1954, in Jakarta. He was interred at the Kalibata Heroes Cemetery.

Personal life and legacy 
Salim married Zaenatun Nahar, a cousin, in 1912. The marriage produced eight children: Theodora Atia (Dolly); Jusuf Taufik (Totok); Violet Hanifah (Yoyet); Maria Zenobia; Achmad Sjewket; Islam Basjari; Abdul Hadi; Siti Asia; Zuchra Adiba; and Abdurrachman Ciddiq. Hadi and Adiba died as babies, while Sjewket was killed in action during the Indonesian revolution. Chalid Salim, Salim's younger brother, was a communist who became Catholic pastor during his years of exile in Boven Digoel. Emil Salim, a prominent economist and minister in Suharto administration, is a nephew.

Dolly, the eldest, was known for being the first person to sing the lyrics of Indonesia Raya, later adopted as the republic's national anthem, during the Second Youth Congress (Kongres Pemuda II) in 1928. Violet married Djohan Sjahroezah, a prominent socialist and underground anti-Japanese activist and a nephew of Sjahrir, Salim's revolutionary protege.

Salim was known for his frugality and simple lifestyle. Mohammad Roem, in a piece for Prisma magazine, described the lifestyle of the man whom he succeeded as Foreign Minister as a manifestation of leiden is lijden (""leading is suffering""), an old Dutch proverb. He and his wife agreed not to send their children to Dutch colonial schools, despite being a product of the institutions himself; instead, they mostly homeschooled them.

Informally bestowed the honorific title of the ""Grand Old Man"" (Kamitua yang Mulia), Salim was reported to be fluent in at least nine languages. Minangkabau and Malay would have been his natives languages, followed by English, Dutch, French, Japanese, German, Latin, and Turkish. He raised his children in a multilingual household. In an anecdote told by Cornell professor George McTurnan Kahin to historian Asvi Warman Adam, Salim and South Vietnamese leader (and future president) Ngo Dinh Diem sat together in a faculty dining room at the Cornell campus. Salim stroke a conversation he soon dominated over French-educated Diem.

Salim was best remembered for his sharp wit and debating skills. In a version of the story (as told by Jef Last), several Sarekat Islam members tried to mock Salim, who is in the middle of a speech, with goat sounds; alluring to Salim's white beard and in a way, his devout Islamic faith. Salim calmly responded by asking the chair ""whether Sarekat has invited a herd of goats to its meeting""; and if yes, ""as a polyglot I would honour their right to listen to a speech by speaking in hircine language."" In another instance, Salim was mocked by Bergmeyer, a Dutch member of the Volksraad for delivering a speech in Malay. At one point Salim had said ekonomi, the Malayized word for economy, and Bergmeyer challenged him to state the original Malay for the word. Salim quickly retorted: ""if you can say what 'economy' is in the original Dutch, I'll state the Malay version for you."" Both Malay and Dutch absorbed 'economy' from the Ancient Greek word of οἰκονομία, so there would be no original word in both languages.

He was also popular for his lighthearted humour. A lifelong smoker of cigar (he would sometimes lit one while teaching at Cornell) a common lore was that when Salim, on behalf of the Indonesian government, met Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh (some claimed, however, it's the other British royalties) during a dinner at the coronation of Elizabeth II in June 1953. A British diplomat assigned to him had asked him not to smoke his kretek in the Westminster Abbey and in the palace. During the dinner, however, Salim found the young Duke was still awkward and unsettled while greeting his guests as a new consort to the Queen. He lit his kretek and asked if the Duke knew of it. When the Duke inquired what was Salim smoking, he answered: ""That, Your Highness, is the reason for which the West conquered the world!""

Salim was posthumously declared a National Hero in 1960. Padang's main football stadium was named in his honor, alongside numerous roads in major Indonesian cities.

9437,"['"" Emília Anda Onde Por , story short a has Scliar Moacyr Author ?']","Emília, also known as the Marchioness of Rabicó or Emília, A Boneca Gente (""The Human Doll"") is a fictional character and a titular of the Sítio do Picapau Amarelo series of fantasy novels written by Brazilian author Monteiro Lobato. A doll with a rough, antagonistic personality and an independent, anarchist behaviour, Emília is Lobato's most popular creation alongside Jeca Tatu and, according to studies and analyses of his work, she is his personification in the stories and that, towards the character, Lobato expresses his own ideas. Even though, Lobato has stated that Emília is ""sometimes so independent that neither I, nor her father, succeed in controlling her"".
Since 1951, Emília has been adapted to stage plays, theatrical films and television series, portrayed by several actresses (eleven altogether) throughout the decades in Brazil.

History
Emília is a rag doll described as ""clumsy"" or ""ugly"", resembling a ""witch"" that was handmade by Aunt Nastácia, the ranch's cook, for the little girl Lúcia, also known as ""Little Nose"". Some day, while at the creek of a nearby stream, Lucia fell asleep and was supposedly (as the narrative initially suggests the girl could be dreaming) awaken by a tiny fish and his friend, a cockchafer, while they talked to each other on her upturned nose. The two of them were flung afar after Lúcia sneezed because of their presence. Thinking that Lúcia was a monster, the bug left, but the fish (dressed in suit and tie), stood, and introduced himself as the Scaly Prince from the Clear Waters Kingdom. Lúcia introduced herself and a still inanimate Emília, and both were invited to visit the Prince's underwater kingdom. Lúcia then discovered that the stream was a portal to a woundrous place full of other talking fishes and insects. As the frog guard, Major Sticky, was found sleeping at the Palace's gateway, the Prince suggested Lúcia to dress him with Emília's skirt, and obligated him to eat several sea rocks as a punishment for sleeping while working. At the dinner, Lúcia first met Doctor Snail, and complained about Emília's current situation. The Doctor then medicated the doll with a dose of his pills (the same Major Sticky later accidentally ingested, mistaking them with sea rocks), and Emília suddenly started talking, and would never stop henceforth. She immediately nominated herself as the ""Marchioness of Rabicó"", the ""Countess of Three Tiny Stars"". Lúcia then was forced to go back to surface as Aunt Nastácia screamed loud enough to shake the bottom of the sea.

Lúcia arrived home surprising her tender grandmother, Mrs. Benta, and scaring Aunt Nastácia, with her brand-new, talkative and living Emília. Later, Emília met Lúcia's cousin that arrived from town, Pedrinho.
Emília's position as the ""Marchioness of Rabicó"" makes Lúcia have the idea of promoting a royal engagement between the doll and the greezy, fat and lazy pig of the same name, starting to treat her as an actual marchioness and bride. Emília believes when Lúcia tells her that the pig had been a charming prince one day, before an evil fairy cursed him. The doll decides she will accept the pig's ""proposal"", even though she won't live with Rabicó until he turns back to normal. Lúcia suggested the creation of a nearby ""royal"" figure. Primally using a corn cob, Pedrinho then created the ""Viscount of Sabugosa"", which in an unknown form came to life and, beyond the wedding prank, would become Emília's counterpart to the boy. Believing in everything, Emília was then ""married"" to Rabicó, for Lúcia and Pedrinho's delight, but was led to a disastrous after-party when the pig attacked the homemade candies, for Emília's disgust. The doll fainted after Pedrinho revealed her the truth about Rabicó's ""curse"". At a dinner, Emília roughly celebrated as everybody thought Aunt Nastácia had roasted her husband, for Lúcia's despair.

This time with Rabicó, the Viscount and Pedrinho, Lúcia and Emília returned to the Underwater Kingdom as Lúcia receives a letter from the fishes, stating that the Prince, after her sudden departure, was left in sadness. At the Kingdom, for everyone's surprise, the Viscount reveals himself to have the mind of an intellectual biologist. He and his people, for Emília's delight, are invited by Narizinho to visit their ranch. Emília insists to Mrs. Benta to exchange one of the cows for a whale from the Kingdom. As one of the guests, Miss Sardine (a pilchard), gets fried after she confuses Aunt Nastácia's boiling oil with a swimming pool, the Prince and his subjects decide to leave the Yellow Woodpecker Ranch. However, Lúcia had yet no rescue the Prince, as he had ""unlearned the art of swimming"" after too much time away from the water.

Emília creates dissension with who appears to be Felix the Cat, after he arrives in the rach with ""gawky"" stories (all of them contradicted by the Viscount). She is decided to think of a tale better than the one told by Felix the night before, and succeeds, as everybody applauses her, leaving the Cat jealous. After one of the fowls is killed and devoured, the Viscount starts a Sherlock Holmes-like investigation, and the Cat, which in fact is not Felix, is expelled by Aunt Nastácia.

In the most original volume of the series, A Chave do Tamanho (""The Size Key""), Emília commits her greatest act, after noticing that the horror of World War II is causing pain in everyone, particularly Mrs. Benta, and filling the ranch with sadness. Traveling by the magical powder of Pirlimpimpim, Emília visits a house where are placed the Keys that can turn on and turn off the impossible to the most unimaginable things. Attempting to turn down the Key of War, Emília chooses the wrong one, and turns down the Key that controls the size equilibrium of every human being. Emília founds herself hundreds of times smaller, among her dress, and later finds out that she caused the same to happen with the whole humanity. The doll becomes smaller enough to settle her own ""ranch"" on the Viscount's topper. As the small people become used to their new life, Emília manages to visit the White House, where she interacts with the President of the United States and questions him about the War. After realizing that the Size was ""evil"" since the scarcity from before the shrinkage have been replaced by abundance, Emília proposes a referendum, so people will vote either for or against the Size. After everyone agrees to return to their normal size, Emília takes the Viscount to the House of Keys, where he turns the Size on once again.

Other occasion was the literal reform the doll proposed to the whole nature, which ended up with earthworms, insects such like ants and centipedes, as well as microscopic beings such as fleas, having their sizes increased to the proportion of a dog (the opposite to what happened in A Chave do Tamanho).

Tie-ins
Emília, alongside the Viscount and Mrs. Benta, in featured in a tie-in biographical novel written by Brazilian author Luciana Sandrini, Minhas Memórias de Lobato (""My Lobato Memories""). The story is similar to Memórias de Emília, but in Minhas Memórias, the doll decides to write about her creator, once again with the ""help"" of the Viscount. Mrs. Benta then tells them his story, detailing his entire life, from childhood to his final years.

Author Moacyr Scliar has a short story, Por Onde Anda Emília""? (literally ""Whatever Happened to Emilia?""), in which he suggests the fates of the doll and her family after several years have passed. While Mrs. Benta and Aunt Nastácia had died, Rabicó had been turned into ham after all, and Pedrinho and Lúcia became adults and ""vanished"", an aged Emília was still alive and defiant as always, dreaming about switching off the keys of Poverty, Unemployment and Hunger (Brazilian social issues of the present day), and about the Yellow Woodpecker farm itself, their former world of fantasy now possessed by homeless invaders (a reference to the MST). Having a conservative and an anarchist side, Emilia demonstrates being dubious over the movement, divided between adhering and rebelling, while the most recommended person to advise her, her own creator, has already died.

Personality
Emília develops from an ordinary rag doll to an ""almost human"" doll, as she demonstrates to be abnormally intelligent by insisting on her own ideologies and opinions, even though she insists to pronounce many words in the wrong way, or on her own way. For example, she prefers to say ""liscabão"" rather than ""beliscão"" (""pinch""), and insisted to refer to Doctor Snail as Doctor ""Cara-de-coruja"" (which is assonant to ""caramujo"", which is one word for ""snail"" in Portuguese).

According to herself, Emília is ""Independência ou Morte!"", a catchphrase she took from Prince Pedro I, who proclaimed the Independence of Brazil. Emília has proven herself to be rogue, rebellious, stubborn, rough and intensely determined. In Histórias Diversas, she attempts to take a group of nymphs to her own by tricking their leader. She also was decided to cut off the wings of a little angel in Memórias de Emília, but fails as the angel manage to escape.

Controversy
Monteiro Lobato has been criticized for his racist portrayal and treatment of black people in several of his works. This can be noticed in the way Emília refers to Aunt Nastácia (a mulatta), or the way she treats the cook. With the Sítio do Picapau Amarelo novel series, this has been analysed in the way he depicts Aunt Nastácia. In Peter Pan, while Mrs. Benta tells J. M. Berry's novel to her grandsons, Aunt Nastácia complains about ""missing pieces"" of her own shadow. It is later revealed by the Viscount that Emília was, literally, cutting of the woman's shadow with a scissor, leaving everyone to what the doll simply smiled with superiority, after spending a considerable part of the novel questioning about Nastácia's beliefs and her color.

In other media
Emília's behaviour and physical aspect are intensely softened when the character is adapted into live-action portrayal. A magical subplot was added to the Rede Globo version of the character as, in their version, Emília is able to bring imagination to real only by ""pretending"". Her ability is constantly desired by the story's antagonists, primally the reptilian evil hag Cuca.

Film and television
Emília was portrayed for the first time in the 1951 feature film O Saci, directed by Rodolfo Nanni, based on the novel of the same name, the second volume of the series. Child actress Olga Maria plays the doll in the movie.

In the following year, she was portrayed by an adult actress, and so would be for the next fifty years. Lúcia Lambertini was cast as Emília in the first television series based on the Sítio novels, produced by TV Tupi. On two occasions, when Lambertini got married and later pregnant, she was replaced by Dulce Margarida. The two actresses then started portraying the doll mutually, after Lambertini left São Paulo to continue acting as Emília in Rio de Janeiro.
Zodja Pereira took the part in the 1967 Rede Bandeirantes' series.
A second theatrical film, released in 1973, had Leda Zepellin in the role, directed by Geraldo Sarno.
The most famous portrayal of Emília, as a colorful rag doll with a trademark make-up and patchwork hair, would start in 1977, after actress Dirce Migliaccio was cast as Emília for the first Rede Globo series Sítio do Picapau Amarelo, that is now considered a classic. In 1978, Migliaccio was replaced by Reny de Oliveira, who left the series in 1982 after not having a positive feedback from the character. Oliveira is notorious for posing nude for Playboy Brasil in order to rid her image from Emília. Suzana Abranches then assumed her place between 1983 and 1986, when the show was then cancelled.
Sítio do Picapau Amarelo would come back fourteen years later, in 2001, with Isabelle Drummond in the role. Drummond was supposed to read for the part of Lúcia, but choose to read Emília's by herself, being cast at the age of 8. The role debuted her career and became strongly popular in the following years.  A Rede Globo television special presented by Drummond as Emília, in 2004, featured a scene where the doll encountered Dirce Migliaccio's character when looking through a mirror, seeing Dirce's Emília as her reflection. In another television special to celebrate Rede Globo's 40th anniversary, Isabelle Drummond (as a girl thar grew up watching the network) was digitally inserted in several programs of Globo, including past versions of Sítio. The actress left the series in 2006.
Tatyane Goulart replaced Isabelle Drummond in 2007, the final year of the show after its 2001 revival. Sítio was cancelled due to poor ratings in that year.
In 2012, the 2001 version of Sítio, as well as the novel Reinações de Narizinho, served as the basis for an animated series of same name, which is produced by Globo and Mixer. Isabella Guarnieri voices Emília in the episodes.

Comics
Sítio do Picapau Amarelo became a comic in 1977, published by RGE. The characters later received their own titles, including the doll, with Emília which was published between 1979 and 1980 earning 6 issues.

The 2001 series was brought into the comic book format in 2003, for the national Brazilian anti-hunger campaign Fome Zero, entitled Emília e a Turma do Sítio no Fome Zero. The series generally dealt with nutritional reeducation. Between 2006 and 2008 there was a little return of the Sítio do Picapau Amarelo comics, published by Editora Globo. In 2007 Emilia returned to have her title published, and lasted until 2008 earning 12 issues.

Lereah served as the President of Reecon Advisors, Inc., a real estate advisory and information company located in the Washington, D.C. area, from 2008 to 2020.  Lereah was previously an Executive Vice President at Move, Inc. and before that, Chief Economist for the National Association of Realtors (NAR). Lereah served as the NAR's spokesman on economic forecasts, interest rates, home sales, mortgage rates, as well as other policy issues and trends affecting the United States real estate industry. Lereah was also the Chief Economist for the Mortgage Bankers Association during the 1990s and has testified before Congress on economic and real estate matters.

On April 30, 2007, the NAR announced that in May Lereah would be leaving his job as chief economist to join Move, Inc. as an Executive Vice President. He was succeeded by Lawrence Yun. Lereah left Move in 2008 to join Reecon Advisors, Inc.

He received his B.A. in Economics & Marketing from American University, Washington, D.C. and his Ph.D. in Economics from the University of Virginia. He lives in Port St. Lucie, Florida.

Publications
Lereah's book The Rules for Growing Rich: Making Money in the New Information Economy touting investment in technology company equities was published in June 2000 at the onset of the collapse of the dot-com bubble.

Lereah has also written about real estate investing. His book All Real Estate is Local was published by Doubleday in 2007. His 2005 book Are You Missing the Real Estate Boom?: Why Home Values and Other Real Estate Investments Will Climb Through The End of The Decade—And How to Profit From Them was rereleased in February 2006 as Why the Real Estate Boom Will Not Bust—And How You Can Profit from It.

In 2020, Lereah published The Power of Positive Aging: Successfully Coping with the Inconveniences of Aging.

Criticisms
Lereah has been criticized for encouraging the rise of the United States housing bubble.  According to a HousingPanic blog post quoted by the Chicago Tribune, ""In October 2005 Lereah was busy calling the bubble believers 'Chicken Littles.' Many of the predictions espoused by the 'Chicken Littles' are fast becoming closer to reality. ... David Lereah has lost credibility because of his irresponsible cheerleading.""

Commenting on the phenomenon of shifting NAR accounts of the national housing market, the Motley Fool reported, in June 2006,
""There's nothing funnier or more satisfying … than watching the National Association of Realtors (NAR) change its tune these days. The latest news release from this sunny-Jim industry group finally fesses up to its past fiction, but even when it admits the bubble's going to pop, it can't muster the courage to just come out and say it. … the NAR is full of it and will spin the numbers any way it can to keep up the pleasant fiction that all is well. … [T]he cracks began to show in subsequent remarks from NAR 'Chief Economist' David Lereah. The head outfit that ridiculed the idea of a housing bubble for years is now crying for Ben Bernanke to bring it back. … It should have been completely obvious to anyone with a loan calculator and a glance at wage increases that those months of industry bubble denials were just wishful thinking.""

Business Week also captured Lereah's most famous quote:

""The steady improvement in [home] sales will support price appreciation...[despite] all the wild projections by academics, Wall Street analysts, and others in the media.""  Lereah was Chief Economist at the National Association of Realtors when he said this.  The day was Jan 10, 2007, just as housing prices steadily worsened falling even farther than many skeptics had predicted.

This development led to a more actively interventionist foreign policy for England, going forward in its history.

In addition to concerns about expanded Spanish power in the Netherlands, which was supposed to threaten England itself, French intrigue in the region under the Duke of Anjou also mattered, It became a consideration for Elizabeth's government in addressing its policy towards the Netherlands.

Prominent officials, including Robert Dudley, the Earl of Leicester, and Francis Walsingham, as well as the Queen herself, discussed the situation openly. They took it that the future of the Netherlands was pertinent to English sovereignty. Internal disagreements between the Earl of Leicester and the Queen on the best approach became a controversy on whether direct involvement was necessary, or monetary support and sanctuary to Dutch rebels was better.

English political concerns around the Netherlands

Concerns with the Spanish and Spanish Allies

The primary external concern came from worries around the potential actions of Spain. Initial discussion on the necessity of English involvement within the then-ongoing Dutch Revolt was elevated through fear on the part of the Queen's Privy Council to the possibility of the Netherlands to be used by Spain as a staging ground for an  invasion into England as a means to depose Elizabeth and reinstate the Catholic Church. Questions were raised among the advisors to the degree of the Spanish King's religious resolve to Catholicism, and as a result, the potential alignment to the wishes of Pope Pius V after Elizabeth's excommunication and the subsequent loss of  her legitimacy in the Regnans in Excelsis in 1570.  The papal bull, which split Catholics that were within England between devotion to their country and monarch, and to their church within their own community, created uncertainty also to Elizabeth's government in how to predict Phillip's progress. According to historian Wallace T. MacCaffrey:

What frightened and baffled even the most cool-headed English councillors in assessing the probable course of Spanish policy was the unpredictable ideological component in Phillip’s views. Would he be content with the restoration of his power and the re-establishment of his faith in his Burgundian provinces, or would the compulsions of religious ideology drive him beyond these traditional aims to the grander tasks of exterminating heresy in general, and, in particular, in the British Isles? 

Outside of England, and despite a deep common hatred of Spain within England, English Catholic émigrés that fled to the Netherlands as a result of Elizabeth's government, put faith into Phillip to be the catalyst of a return to Catholicism, most strongly so with the de-legitimization of Elizabeth's cousin and next heir at the time, Mary, Queen of Scots.

Governors of the Spanish Netherlands
Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, the 3rd Duke of Alba, became as governor a symbol for oppression among the Protestant Dutch, having this exemplified in the popular imagination among that population by the executions of Lamoral, Count of Egmont and Philip de Montmorency, Count of Horn.

Don John of Austria, a half-brother of Phillip II, was viewed as having been appointed governor by Phillip in light of his own ambition, having himself “dreamed of a throne of his own.”  Don John was also considered by English Catholic émigrés “as early as 1572” to be a good suitor to Mary, Queen of Scots, legitimizing a claim to the English throne.  This unofficial candidacy was definitely a cause for concern among the Privy Council under Elizabeth.

House of Croye
From within the Netherlands, the House of Croye rooted itself as the prominent Catholic family, contrasting to the Protestant House of Orange. Led by the brothers Charles Philippe de Croÿ, Marquis d’Havré and Philippe III de Croÿ, the House supported Spanish intervention within the Low Countries in the interest of working against French influence.  In the interests of leadership, they favored a relative of Phillip's, the Archduke Matthias of Austria as the Dutch governor, which he became in January 1578 as Governor-General of Brussels. However, the leader of their rivals in the House of Orange, William the Silent, became the Lieutenant-General underneath Matthias as a result in seeking out a joint Catholic-Protestant solution.

The House also took a particular stance on English assistance, leading other Catholic noble families in accepting English monetary assistance, but not English manpower, especially expeditions led by the Earl of Leicester, who was friendly with the House of Orange.  They succeeded to have the Council of State bar the acceptance of English men in late 1577, yet held onto a promise made by Elizabeth of £100,000 to be spent in the conflict.  This resolve was later reversed by the States, however, and manned English assistance was allowed on November 19 of that year.

Assassination of William the Silent, the Prince of Orange
(see also: William the Silent: Assassination)

The assassination of William of Orange in 1584 by a Catholic supporter of Philip II acting upon an edict by the latter to have William killed, led to an emboldening of Protestant fervor against the Spanish government despite the action seeming to decapitate the initial resistance movement.  Elizabeth responded to the assassination of the Prince of Orange with strengthening her policies assisting in the revolt.

Possibility of French influence
Even though the Kingdom of France itself was not of an immediate threat or direct concern to the Elizabethan government as Spain was seen to be, its potential ability to utilize the Netherlands against the interests of England caused Elizabeth's government to also consider France in its exterior assessments. France at this time had a similar level of religious conflict in its own borders, between the Catholic establishment of the French Crown and the Protestant Huguenots. Yet despite this, concern existed on the proximity and subsequent power of France:

For Englishmen the specter of French domination of the Low Countries was a frightening one. It would give that kingdom a throttle-hold on England’s main trading partner and secure to her the great financial and industrial resources of these rich provinces. And strategically England would be flanked at every angle from Biscay to the Ems by the single power of France. This last consideration weighed heavily in all English decisions about their neighbors’ affairs. There could be no neutrality towards the troubles of the seventeen provinces nor towards those of France so long as the probability of French intervention in the former remained.

The Duke of Anjou

(see also: Francis, Duke of Anjou)

Interest in the Duke of Anjou to English interests began at the end of April in 1578, when commissioners representing the States were negotiating with representatives of the Duke, where the States wished for the Duke  to be involve himself in the conflict by invading other Habsburg-held territories that were not part of the Revolt, such as Burgundy.  Although these discussions yielded no result in practice, it led to reaction by Elizabeth in turn.
When these dealings were brought to the Queen's attentions, William Davison was given orders by Elizabeth to approach the States and amend the terms of the monetary assistance that England would give through Prince Casimir of the Palatinate, who was receiving funding from England in increments of £20,000 for soldiers to help the States, requiring now that it would be on the condition that the States can no longer deal with the Duke if a second £20,000 were to be sent.  By late May, the Duke attempts to engage in a treaty with the States to commit “for two months with 10,000 foot soldiers and 2,000 horsemen under his own direct control.” This made Elizabeth furious with the States, ordering Davison to freeze English assets to the States and order Casimir to stay idle until dealings with the Duke are completely ceased and when representatives Walsingham and Cobham will arrive.

At the same time, in the spring of 1578, a series of Protestant insurrections arose in the southern, Spanish-controlled Netherlands, which led to them having “seized churches for their use, expelled the religious orders, smashed altars and images, and demanded the right to public observance and promulgation of their faith.”  From these insurrections, the fear of a Spanish advantage from the Dutch disunity as a result of the mass protests caused Elizabeth to promptly reconsider her stance on the Duke, allowing “clandestine agents” to establish a direct line, as well as giving freedom to the States to deal with the Duke.

Sympathies of leaders and other prominent people

Queen Elizabeth I

During her reign, the Queen would evolve her strategies surrounding English involvement in the Low Countries at a gradual pace, growing in the amount and type of assistance she was willing to give as time progressed. The  concerns levied by her Privy Council about the desire of Phillip II to conduct a Spanish expedition into England were particularly strengthened with the assassination of William, the Prince of Orange, in 1588, where it seemed to be established in the mind of Elizabeth that Phillip was willing to go on an offensive.

In beginning her moves towards intervention, the Queen desired on taking an indirect approach to the situation in the Netherlands, seeking to preemptively establish a formal alliance built among Protestant member princes of the Holy Roman Empire to develop a solidified pan-Protestant solidarity for when it seemed appropriate to act.  In this, she approached various German princes to forge the alliance:

Frederick II of Denmark, a German prince of the Empire as Duke of Holstein, was considered by Elizabeth to be a key ally. Initially refusing on September 12, 1577, the direct and formal alliance with England that Elizabeth had anticipated, Frederick began during the rest of the 1570s and into the 1580s to come round to Elizabeth's idea of Protestant cooperation.  In a series of exchanges, Frederick resolved to mediate between England and Spain in the Dutch conflict: if Frederick's aid was not accepted by Philip II of Spain, ""he would close the Sound to their traffic and (if necessary) offer direct military support to their protestant adversaries, including Elizabeth.""

Duke Casimir of the Palatinate was one of Elizabeth's closest allies from her earliest approaches to the conflict. In early 1578, with Elizabeth unwilling use English forces after the defeat of the Protestant Dutch army at the Battle of Gembloux and concerned about such a move provoking the French, she approached the Duke with funds to recruit “6,000 Swiss and 5,000 ‘reiters’ to the provinces” to assist the Dutch.  The Duke, who was already aligned to the Protestant cause, took advantage of the opportunity, with payment by Elizabeth being “20,000 pounds immediately and the same sum in addition on days of musters, to be charged against the loan of 100,000 pounds.”  This payment would later be halted in response to the States' initial dealings with the Duke of Anjou, and then later returned upon the thaw of Elizabeth's opinion on the Duke of Anjou being involved in the conflict.

The Protestant states of the Netherlands under William also dealt officially in the agreement to solidarity which Elizabeth attempted to foster with the other German states. The Prince of Orange, through Daniel Rogers, suggested a deal with Elizabeth on a direct military alliance against Spain. It anticipated war, and looked to act preemptively against Philip II and his ‘crusade of Catholic re-conquest.’  Elizabeth rejected the offer, and instead made a counter-proposal, as a means to draw the Netherlands into unity with the other Protestant states of continental Europe.  Other German states within the Holy Roman Empire that were potential allies in direct alliances included Brunswick, Hesse, Württemberg, and Saxony.

Direct involvement became a change in the policy precedence with Elizabeth with the Leicester Expedition into the Low Countries, allowing for English troops directly under the control of an English leader to be present in the region. Publicly, and to avoid the anxiety around direct involvement in the eyes of the Spanish, Elizabeth had released her intentions with the move on the basis of a cultural defense of the Protestant Dutch:

to give aid to the defence of the people afflicted and oppressed in the Low Countries, were not any desire of aggrandizing either herself or her subjects, but to aid the natural people of those countries to defend their towns from sacking and desolation, and thereby to procure them safety, to the honour of God, whom they desire to serve sincerely as Christian people, according to his word, and to enjoy their ancient liberties; to free herself from invading neighbours; and to ensure a continuance of the old-standing intercourse of friendship and merchandise betwixt her people and the inhabitants of those countries.

In November 1585, she wrote a letter to the States-General within the Netherlands for her declaring her candidacy of Robert Dudley, the Earl of Leicester, to lead the expedition, as well as declaring her favor towards the interest of the Low Countries.  Later into the campaign, however, she would take contention with the Earl's approaches in objective to the Expedition, in seeking to establish an entirely new government within the Netherlands independent entirely of the Spanish, an option the Queen did not wish to take.

Robert Dudley, the Earl of Leicester

Background with the Low Countries

Before the Leicester Expedition was to take place, Robert Dudley, the Earl of Leicester, already had interactions in the Low Countries, being sympathetic to the Protestant cause led by the House of Orange.  This intimacy between the Earl and the House of Orange caused him to be a source of fear among those in contest with Orange, such as the House of Croye. The success of the latter Dutch House in blocking direct English aid in the States-General in late 1577 came as an offence to the Earl, who came to division with William of Orange, viewing it as offensive, until William Davison cooled tensions between the two men.  Tension would also arise as well between the Earl and the Queen during the Leicester Expedition over the actions that were taken by the former during the campaign.

The Leicester Expedition
(see also: The Leicester Expedition)

The impetus behind what would become the Leicester Expedition came about from advice given to her by the Privy Council to operate with a stronger active role within the Low Countries. According to John Bruce of the Camden Society, the advice of the Privy Council was to:

send over a considerable body of auxiliary forces, and to place them under the command of some eminent person, who should not merely direct the military operations, but should also assist the States-General with his counsel, and put them in the way of correcting many errors of government into which they have fallen.

Elizabeth had initially disagreed with this advice, fearing primarily of the precedent that could be set in assisting rebellions against a sovereign ruler, especially against Phillip II in consideration to the danger she was in with the Catholic world. By September 1585, it was guaranteed that the Queen would nominate Robert Dudley to the Privy Council and to the States-General within the Netherlands, due to his perceived intimate knowledge and level of connection to the Queen herself, being a “personal favorite” of hers that also did not have a necessary and irreplaceable role in her Court.

Direct correspondences between Robert Dudley and the Court began on December 1585, in a letter from Francis Walsingham addressed to Dudley, reporting on the Queen's direct instructions for the campaign: stabilize the government, to not engage in battles without “great advantage” assured, to maintain discipline and punishing those who do not honor that call for discipline, to make leaders responsible that forces under their command are at full capacity, to pay soldiers “by the head” with payment disbursed to the captains first, punish leaders who abuse their posts, employ “some well chosen persones” that organize collecting contributions to the war effort, to respect the authority of Dutch nobles as well as especially the children of the late William (of Orange), to clarify that England will not take dominion over the Netherlands at the end of this expedition, and to be available to advise Dutch nobility whenever needed.

The Earl, however, desired to see a return to the Netherlands of the government exercised under the Prince of Orange, who was assassinated the year earlier.  This angered the Queen to the Earl's actions, which would become evident when he writes to Walsingham, as well as Elizabeth's Lord Treasurer, Lord Chamberlain, and Vice Chamberlain, acknowledging that the Queen does not appreciate the Earl's own support of this separate Dutch government. Despite understanding this and begging for forgiveness from the Queen, he implores the men he writes to that he is coming solely from a place to benefit the Queen and England as a whole.  The height of Elizabeth's discontent with Dudley is explained in letters directly from the Queen to the Earl and delivered by Sir Thomas Heneadge, dated February 10, 1585–6, where she demands him to publicly resign his authority and to inform the States that the actions in accepting the government that Dudley had undertaken did not reflect her wishes as Queen.

Biography
In 1969 Maessen finished second on the series final of the TV talent show New Faces. Maessen was a mother of two children from Melbourne and signed with Ron Tudor's production company. In December Maessen released her debut single ""The Love Moth"", which was an English language cover version of an Italian song, ""La Pioggia"", by Gigliola Cinquetti. Maessen's version reached the Go-Set National Top 40 in April 1970 and was a top 10 hit in Melbourne. Maessen also appeared on local TV shows.

Maessen's second pop single, ""Knock, Knock Who's There?"" was a cover version of Mary Hopkin's entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1970. It was released on Fable Records in April 1970 and peaked at No. 2. It co-charted with Hopkin's version. During the 1970 radio ban, a major dispute between commercial radio stations and record companies, Hopkin's version was not well known to Australian listeners. ""Knock, Knock Who's There?"" finished third on Go-Sets Top Records for the Year of 1970 and was the highest placed by an Australian artist. Maessen became the first Australian female artist to be awarded a gold record certificate for a single with sales of over 50,000. She won the 1971 George Wallace Memorial Logie for Best New Talent and in the Go-Set Pop Poll was voted in the top five as most popular female vocalist.

In March 1971 Maessen released her fourth single, ""Hurry on Down"", which did not chart. In mid-1971 she was again voted in the top five as most popular female vocalist by Go-Set readers. Her debut album, Live for Life, appeared in July with another single, ""Here I Go Again"", in October. She released ""Love Is for the Two of Us"" late in 1971 which was a duet with TV personality Jimmy Hannan. Two further singles followed in 1972 and her last commercial release was ""Hey Mama, Sing Me a Song"" in 1974 composed by Miki Gavrielov an Israeli singer song writer.

9609,['aerial new a need A Dae ?'],"Ulster Scots or Ulster-Scots  (, ), also known as Ulster Scotch and Ullans, is the dialect of Scots spoken in parts of Ulster in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. It is generally considered a dialect or group of dialects of Scots, although groups such as the Ulster-Scots Language Society and Ulster-Scots Academy consider it a language in its own right, and the Ulster-Scots Agency and former Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure have used the term Ulster-Scots language.

Some definitions of Ulster Scots may also include Standard English spoken with an Ulster Scots accent. This is a situation like that of Lowland Scots and Scottish Standard English with words pronounced using the Ulster Scots phonemes closest to those of Standard English.
Ulster Scots has been influenced by Hiberno-English, particularly Ulster English, and by Ulster Irish. As a result of the competing influences of English and Scots, varieties of Ulster Scots can be described as ""more English"" or ""more Scots"".

Names
While once referred to as Scotch-Irish by several researchers, that has now been superseded by the term Ulster Scots. Speakers usually refer to their vernacular as 'Braid Scots', 'Scotch' or 'the hamely tongue'. Since the 1980s Ullans, a neologism popularized by the physician, amateur historian and politician Ian Adamson, merging Ulster and Lallans, the Scots for Lowlands, but also an acronym for “Ulster-Scots language in literature and native speech” and Ulstèr-Scotch, the preferred revivalist parlance, have also been used. Occasionally, the term Hiberno-Scots is used, but it is usually used for the ethnic group rather than the vernacular.

Speaker population and spread

During the middle of the 20th century, the linguist Robert John Gregg established the geographical boundaries of Ulster's Scots-speaking areas based on information gathered from native speakers. By his definition, Ulster Scots is spoken in mid and east Antrim, north Down, north-east County Londonderry, and in the fishing villages of the Mourne coast. It is also spoken in the Laggan district and parts of the Finn Valley in east Donegal and in the south of Inishowen in north Donegal. Writing in 2020, the Fintona-born linguist Warren Maguire argued that some of the criteria that Gregg used as distinctive of Ulster Scots are common in south-west Tyrone and were found in other sites across Northern Ireland investigated by the Linguistic Survey of Scotland.

The 1999 Northern Ireland Life and Times Survey found that 2% of Northern Ireland residents claimed to speak Ulster Scots, which would mean a total speech community of approximately 30,000 in the territory. Other estimates range from 35,000 in Northern Ireland, to an ""optimistic"" total of 100,000 including the Republic of Ireland (mainly the east of County Donegal). Speaking at a seminar on 9 September 2004, Ian Sloan of the Northern Ireland Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure (DCAL) accepted that the 1999 Northern Ireland Life and Times Survey ""did not significantly indicate that unionists or nationalists were relatively any more or less likely to speak Ulster Scots, although in absolute terms there were more unionists who spoke Ulster Scots than nationalists"".

In the 2011 census of Northern Ireland, 16,373 people (0.9% of the population) stated that they can speak, read, write and understand Ulster Scots and 140,204 people (8.1% of the population) reported having some ability in Ulster Scots.

Status

Linguistic status

The majority of linguists treat Ulster Scots as a variety of the Scots language; Caroline Macafee, for example, writes that ""Ulster Scots is [...] clearly a dialect of Central Scots.""  The Northern Ireland Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure considers Ulster Scots to be ""the local variety of the Scots language."" Some linguists, such as Raymond Hickey, treat Ulster Scots (and other forms of Scots) as a dialect of English. It has been said that its ""status varies between dialect and language"".

Enthusiasts such as Philip Robinson (author of Ulster-Scots: a Grammar of the Traditional Written and Spoken Language), the Ulster-Scots Language Society and supporters of an Ulster-Scots Academy are of the opinion that Ulster Scots is a language in its own right. That position has been criticised by the Ulster-Scots Agency, a BBC report stating: ""[The Agency] accused the academy of wrongly promoting Ulster-Scots as a language distinct from Scots."" This position is reflected in many of the Academic responses to the ""Public Consultation on Proposals for an Ulster-Scots Academy""

Legal status
Ulster Scots is defined in an Agreement between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of Ireland establishing implementation bodies done at Dublin on the 8th day of March 1999 in the following terms:

The North/South Co-operation (Implementation Bodies) Northern Ireland Order 1999, which gave effect to the implementation bodies incorporated the text of the agreement in its Schedule 1.

The declaration made by the British Government regarding the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages reads as follows:

This recognition differed significantly from the commitments entered into under the Charter in relation to Irish, for which specific provisions under Part III were invoked for the protection and promotion of that language. The definition of Ullans from the North/South Co-operation (Implementation Bodies) Northern Ireland Order 1999 above was used on 1 July 2005 Second Periodical Report by the United Kingdom to the Secretary General of the Council of Europe outlining how the UK met its obligations under the Charter.

The Good Friday Agreement (which does not refer to Ulster Scots as a ""language"") recognises Ulster Scots as ""part of the cultural wealth of the island of Ireland"", and the Implementation Agreement established the cross-border Ulster-Scots Agency (Tha Boord o Ulstèr-Scotch).

The legislative remit laid down for the agency by the North/South Co-operation (Implementation Bodies) Northern Ireland Order 1999 is: ""the promotion of greater awareness and the use of Ullans and of Ulster-Scots cultural issues, both within Northern Ireland and throughout the island"".

The agency has adopted a mission statement: to promote the study, conservation, development and use of Ulster Scots as a living language; to encourage and develop the full range of its attendant culture; and to promote an understanding of the history of the Ulster-Scots people. Despite the Agency's reference to Ulster Scots as ""a language"", this eliding of the distinction between Ulster Scots as a linguistic form, and ""Ulster Scots culture"" broadly referring to cultural forms associated with the Scottish-descended population, continued thereafter.

The Northern Ireland (St Andrews Agreement) Act 2006 amended the Northern Ireland Act 1998 to insert a section (28D) entitled Strategies relating to Irish language and Ulster Scots language etc. which inter alia laid on the Executive Committee a duty to ""adopt a strategy setting out how it proposes to enhance and develop the Ulster Scots language, heritage and culture."" This reflects the wording used in the St Andrews Agreement to refer to the enhancement and development of ""the Ulster Scots language, heritage and culture"". There is still controversy on the status of Ulster Scots.

History and literature

Scots, mainly Gaelic-speaking, had been settling in Ulster since the 15th century, but large numbers of Scots-speaking Lowlanders, some 200,000, arrived during the 17th century following the 1610 Plantation, with the peak reached during the 1690s. In the core areas of Scots settlement, Scots outnumbered English settlers by five or six to one.

Literature from shortly before the end of the unselfconscious tradition at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries is almost identical with contemporary writing from Scotland. W. G. Lyttle, writing in Paddy McQuillan's Trip Tae Glesco, uses the typically Scots forms kent and begood, now replaced in Ulster by the more mainstream Anglic forms knew, knowed or knawed and begun. Many of the modest contemporary differences between Scots as spoken in Scotland and Ulster may be due to dialect levelling and influence from Mid Ulster English brought about through relatively recent demographic change rather than direct contact with Irish, retention of older features or separate development.

The earliest identified writing in Scots in Ulster dates from 1571: a letter from Agnes Campbell of County Tyrone to Queen Elizabeth on behalf of Turlough O'Neil, her husband. Although documents dating from the Plantation period show conservative Scots features, English forms started to predominate from the 1620s as Scots declined as a written medium.

In Ulster Scots-speaking areas there was traditionally a considerable demand for the work of Scottish poets, often in locally printed editions. These include Alexander Montgomerie's The Cherrie and the Slae in 1700; shortly over a decade later an edition of poems by Sir David Lindsay; nine printings of Allan Ramsay's The Gentle shepherd between 1743 and 1793; and an edition of Robert Burns' poetry in 1787, the same year as the Edinburgh edition, followed by reprints in 1789, 1793 and 1800. Among other Scottish poets published in Ulster were James Hogg and Robert Tannahill.

That was complemented by a poetry revival and nascent prose genre in Ulster, which started around 1720. The most prominent of these was the rhyming weaver poetry, of which, some 60 to 70 volumes were published between 1750 and 1850, the peak being in the decades 1810 to 1840, although the first printed poetry (in the Habbie stanza form) by an Ulster Scots writer was published in a broadsheet in Strabane in 1735. These weaver poets looked to Scotland for their cultural and literary models and were not simple imitators but clearly inheritors of the same literary tradition following the same poetic and orthographic practices; it is not always immediately possible to distinguish traditional Scots writing from Scotland and Ulster. Among the rhyming weavers were James Campbell (1758–1818), James Orr (1770–1816), Thomas Beggs (1749–1847), David Herbison (1800–1880), Hugh Porter (1780–1839) and Andrew McKenzie (1780–1839).

Scots was also used in the narrative by Ulster novelists such as W. G. Lyttle (1844–1896) and Archibald McIlroy (1860–1915). By the middle of the 19th century the Kailyard school of prose had become the dominant literary genre, overtaking poetry. This was a tradition shared with Scotland which continued into the early 20th century. Scots also frequently appeared in Ulster newspaper columns, especially in Antrim and Down, in the form of pseudonymous social commentary employing a folksy first-person style. The pseudonymous Bab M'Keen (probably successive members of the Weir family: John Weir, William Weir, and Jack Weir) provided comic commentaries in the Ballymena Observer and County Antrim Advertiser for over a hundred years from the 1880s.

A somewhat diminished tradition of vernacular poetry survived into the 20th century in the work of poets such as Adam Lynn, author of the 1911 collection Random Rhymes frae Cullybackey, John Stevenson (died 1932), writing as ""Pat M'Carty"", and John Clifford (1900–1983) from East Antrim. In the late 20th century the poetic tradition was revived, albeit often replacing the traditional Modern Scots orthographic practice with a series of contradictory idiolects. Among the significant writers is James Fenton, mostly using a blank verse form, but also occasionally the Habbie stanza. He employs an orthography that presents the reader with the difficult combination of eye dialect, dense Scots, and a greater variety of verse forms than employed hitherto. The poet Michael Longley (born 1939) has experimented with Ulster Scots for the translation of Classical verse, as in his 1995 collection The Ghost Orchid. The writing of Philip Robinson (born 1946) has been described as verging on ""post-modern kailyard"". He has produced a trilogy of novels Wake the Tribe o Dan (1998), The Back Streets o the Claw (2000) and The Man frae the Ministry (2005), as well as story books for children Esther, Quaen o tha Ulidian Pechts and Fergus an tha Stane o Destinie, and two volumes of poetry Alang the Shore (2005) and Oul Licht, New Licht (2009).

A team in Belfast has begun translating portions of the Bible into Ulster Scots. The Gospel of Luke was published in 2009 by the Ullans Press. It is available in the YouVersion Bible Project.

Since the 1990s

In 1992 the Ulster-Scots Language Society was formed for the protection and promotion of Ulster Scots, which some of its members viewed as a language in its own right, encouraging use in speech, writing and in all areas of life.

Within the terms of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages the British Government is obliged, among other things, to:
Facilitate and/or encourage of the use of Scots in speech and writing, in public and private life.
Provide appropriate forms and means for the teaching and study of the language at all appropriate stages.
Provide facilities enabling non-speakers living where the language is spoken to learn it if they so desire.
Promote study and research of the language at universities of equivalent institutions.

The Ulster-Scots Agency, funded by DCAL in conjunction with the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, is responsible for promotion of greater awareness and use of Ullans and of Ulster-Scots cultural issues, both within Northern Ireland and throughout the island. The agency was established as a result of the Belfast Agreement of 1998. Its headquarters are on Great Victoria Street in central Belfast, while the agency has a major office in Raphoe, County Donegal.

In 2001 the Institute of Ulster Scots Studies was established at the University of Ulster.

An Ulster Scots Academy has been planned with the aim of conserving, developing, and teaching the language of Ulster-Scots in association with native speakers to the highest academic standards.

The 2010 documentary The Hamely Tongue by filmmaker Deaglán O Mocháin traces back the origins of this culture and language, and relates its manifestations in today's Ireland.

New orthographies

By the early 20th century the literary tradition was almost extinct, though some 'dialect' poetry continued to be written. Much revivalist Ulster Scots has appeared, for example as ""official translations"", since the 1990s. However, it has little in common with traditional Scots orthography as described in Grant and Dixon's Manual of Modern Scots (1921). Aodán Mac Póilin, an Irish language activist, has described these revivalist orthographies as an attempt to make Ulster Scots an independent written language and to achieve official status. They seek ""to be as different to English (and occasionally Scots) as possible"". He described it as a hotchpotch of obsolete words, neologisms (example: stour-sucker for vacuum cleaner), redundant spellings (example: qoho for who) and ""erratic spelling"". This spelling ""sometimes reflects everyday Ulster Scots speech rather than the conventions of either modern or historic Scots, and sometimes does not"". The result, Mac Póilin writes, is ""often incomprehensible to the native speaker"". In 2000, John Kirk described the ""net effect"" of that ""amalgam of traditional, surviving, revived, changed, and invented features"" as an ""artificial dialect"". He added,It is certainly not a written version of the vestigial spoken dialect of rural County Antrim, as its activists frequently urge, perpetrating the fallacy that it’s wor ain leid. (Besides, the dialect revivalists claim not to be native speakers of the dialect themselves!). The colloquialness of this new dialect is deceptive, for it is neither spoken nor innate. Traditional dialect speakers find it counter-intuitive and false...

In 2005, Gavin Falconer questioned officialdom's complicity, writing: ""The readiness of Northern Ireland officialdom to consign taxpayers’ money to a black hole of translations incomprehensible to ordinary users is worrying"". Recently produced teaching materials, have, on the other hand, been evaluated more positively.

Sample texts
The three text excerpts below illustrate how the traditional written form of Ulster Scots from the 18th to early 20th century was virtually indistinguishable from contemporary written Scots from Scotland.

The Muse Dismissed (Hugh Porter 1780–1839)

Be hush'd my Muse, ye ken the morn
Begins the shearing o' the corn,
Whar knuckles monie a risk maun run,
An' monie a trophy's lost an' won,
Whar sturdy boys wi' might and main
Shall camp, till wrists an' thumbs they strain,
While pithless, pantin' wi' the heat,
They bathe their weazen'd pelts in sweat
To gain a sprig o' fading fame,
Before they taste the dear-bought cream—
But bide ye there, my pens an' papers,
For I maun up, an' to my scrapers—
Yet, min', my lass— ye maun return
This very night we cut the churn.

To M.H. (Barney Maglone 1820?–1875)

This wee thing's o' little value,
But for a' that it may be
Guid eneuch to gar you, lassie,
When you read it, think o' me.

Think o' whan we met and parted,
And o' a' we felt atween—
Whiles sae gleesome, whiles doon-hearted—
In yon cosy neuk at e'en.

Think o' when we dander't
Doon by Bangor and the sea;
How yon simmer day, we wander't
'Mang the fields o' Isle Magee.

Think o' yon day's gleefu' daffin'
(Weel I wot ye mind it still)
Whan we had sic slips and lauchin',
Spielin' daftly up Cave Hill.

Dinna let your e'en be greetin'
Lassie, whan ye think o' me,
Think upo' anither meetin',
Aiblins by a lanward sea.

From The Lammas Fair (Robert Huddleston 1814–1889)

Tae sing the day, tae sing the fair,
That birkies ca' the lammas;
In aul' Belfast, that toun sae rare,
Fu' fain wad try't a gomas.
Tae think tae please a', it were vain,
And for a country plain boy;
Therefore, tae please mysel' alane,
Thus I began my ain way,
Tae sing that day.

Ae Monday morn on Autumn's verge
To view a scene so gay,
I took my seat beside a hedge,
To loiter by the way.
Lost Phoebus frae the clouds o' night,
Ance mair did show his face—
Ance mair the Emerald Isle got light,
Wi' beauty, joy, an' grace;
Fu' nice that day.

The examples below illustrate how 21st century Ulster Scots texts seldom adhere to the previous literary tradition, Yer guide tae the cheenge-ower, perhaps being a rare exception. Instead there has been an increase in the use of somewhat creative phonetic spellings based on the perceived sound-to-letter correspondences of Standard English, i.e. dialect writing, as exemplified in Alice's Carrànts in Wunnerlan or the adoption of a more esoteric ""amalgam of traditional, surviving, revived, changed, and invented features"" as exemplified in Hannlin Rede.

From Yer guide tae the cheenge-ower (digitaluk 2012)

Gin ye hae guid analogue reception the nou, ye'r like no tae need tae replace yer ruiftap or set-tap aerial for the cheenge-ower – thare nae sic thing as a 'deegital aerial'. But gin ye hae ill analogue reception the nou, ye’ll mebbe need tae replace it.

From Alice's Carrànts in Wunnerlan (Anne Morrison-Smyth, 2013)

The Caterpillar an Alice lukt at ither fur a quare while wi’oot taakin: finally the Caterpillar tuk the hookah oot o its mooth, an spoke tae hir in a languid, dozy voice.
“Wha ir yae?” said the Caterpillar.
This wusnae a pooerfu guid openin fur a yarn. Alice answert brev an baakwardly, “A—A harly know, Sir, jest at this minute—at least A know wha A wus this moarnin, but heth, A hae bin changed a wheen o times since thin.”
“What dae yae mean bae that?” said the Caterpillar sternly. “Explain yersel!”
“A cannae explain maesel, A’m feart, Sir,” said Alice, “baecaas A’m naw maesel, yae see.”
“A dinnae see,” said the Caterpillar.
“A cannae mak it onie mair clear,” Alice answer, while polite, “fur A cannae unnerstan it maesel tae stairt wi; an baein sae monie different sizes in yin dae haes turnt mae heid.”

From Hannlin Rede [annual report] 2012–2013 (Männystèr o Fairms an Kintra Fordèrin, 2012)

9697,['AnyDecentMusic Aggregator ?'],"Good Thing is the second studio album by American singer Leon Bridges. It was released on May 4, 2018, by Columbia Records. The album was supported by three singles: ""Bet Ain't Worth the Hand"", ""Bad Bad News"" and ""Beyond"".

Good Thing received generally positive reviews from critics and debuted at number three on the US Billboard 200. The album was nominated for Best R&B Album at the 2019 Grammy Awards. Its single ""Bet Ain't Worth the Hand"" won a Grammy for Best Traditional R&B Performance.

Singles
The album's dual singles, ""Bet Ain't Worth the Hand"" and ""Bad Bad News"", were released for digital download on March 13, 2018, with ""Bet Ain't Worth the Hand"" later sent to urban contemporary radio on April 10, 2018.

The album's third single, ""Beyond"", was released on April 20, 2018, it was later sent to urban contemporary radio on April 30, 2018.

Critical reception

Good Thing was met with generally positive reviews. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 74, based on 17 reviews. Aggregator AnyDecentMusic? gave it 6.9 out of 10, based on their assessment of the critical consensus.

Chris Willman of Variety gave the album a positive review stating, ""The new album is not that drastically less of a classicist affair than Coming Home, when all is said and done, but this time it's a whole variety pack of retro"". Luke Fox of Exclaim! wrote: ""Leon Bridges' sophomore record rings as an endorsement of his range. And that's a great thing for Good Thing, which tempers its pop-radio ambitions with unique bends on the age-old love song in this super-tight, 35-minute ride."" Tara Joshi of The Guardian said, ""Bridges doesn't entirely leave behind his old-school roots, but, while Good Thing is hardly the next Blonde or, indeed, 24K Magic, it leaves you with a greater sense of who he is: loved-up, and striving for a level of ambition that feels within reach"". Reviewing the album for Pitchfork, Olivia Horn said that ""On Good Thing, Bridges has kept his heart on his sleeve but updated his parlance to something a little less affected, a little more believable"". Joe Levy of Rolling Stone said, ""Not everything works. ""If It Feels Good (Then It Must Be)"" and ""You Don't Know"" feel like fake Pharrell, which is some pretty thin plastic. But the closers—the skin-to-skin makeup sex ballad ""Mrs."" and the free-ranging autobiographical narrative ""Georgia to Texas"" (Bridges' second tribute to his mom in as many albums)—show how expansive and individual Bridges can be, even as he guns for the charts"".

In more mixed reviews, Slant Magazines Zachary Hoskins stated: ""The album falters when Bridges strays from his retro-soul wheelhouse."" Kitty Empire of The Observer said, ""Certain sections of Bridges's audience are likely to define themselves against modern forms, so there is a risk here. But Bridges handles the transition deftly"". Kate Lismore of DIY commented that, ""While he proves in spades that he's not merely a throwback artist who has to rely on nostalgia, the mishmash of sounds coming from the album does feel a little muddled at times"".

9716,"['cricket de win Wunna , example For ?', 'match cricket the win ?', 'him see you did When "" means ?']","Bajan , or Bajan Dialect, is an English-based creole language with African and British influences spoken on the Caribbean island of Barbados. Bajan is primarily a spoken language, meaning that in general, standard English is used in print, in the media, in the judicial system, in government, and in day-to-day business, while Bajan is reserved for less formal situations, in music, or in social commentary. Ethnologue reports that, as of 2018, 30,000 Barbadians were native English speakers, while 260,000 natively spoke Bajan.

Languages
Bajan is the Caribbean creole with grammar that most resembles Standard English. There is academic debate on whether its creole features are due to an earlier pidgin state or to some other reason, such as contact with neighbouring English-based creole languages. 

Due to emigration to the Province of Carolina, Bajan has influenced American English and the Gullah language spoken in the Carolinas. Regionally, Bajan has ties to Belizean and Guyanese Creoles.

Unlike Jamaica, Guyana or Trinidad, Barbados was the destination of few enslaved African-born captives after 1800. Thus, African Barbadians became ""Bajanised"" relatively soon after British colonization. This tended to make them less resistant to local culture, with its Anglicised language, religion and customs.

Bajan is a primarily spoken language with no standardised written form. Due to the lack of standardisation, spelling may vary widely from person to person. There is much dialectal variation throughout the island. Barbadians practising Rastafari on the island also tend to speak more with a Jamaican accent than full Bajan. Bajan words and sentences presented below are largely spelled as they are pronounced. New terminology, expressions, jargon, and idioms are regularly added to the dialect by social commentary sung during the annual Crop Over festival.

Features
As in most English-based Caribbean creoles, the interdentals  and  (as in ""thing"", and ""the"" respectively) have merged with other consonants (in this case,  and , respectively, resulting in ""ting"" and ""de""). Unlike most other Caribbean creoles, Bajan is fully rhotic, and if anything more rhotic than North American Standard English. Bajan also has a strong tendency to realize syllable-final  as a glottal stop . Thus the Bajan pronunciation of start, , contrasts sharply with the pronunciation of other Caribbean speakers,  or  or .

Pronouns
Pronouns in Bajan Dialect do not diverge too far from Standard English, but there are differences. As with other similar creoles, Bajan does not differentiate subject and object pronouns, nor possessive pronouns, except in the case of the first person singular. Another difference is the word for the plural you, which is wunna, similar to the Jamaican word unnu / unna or Bahamian yinna. Here is a list of pronouns in Bajan Dialect:

The word ""yuh"" is interchangeably pronounced  or .

Questions
The structure of questions in Bajan Dialect varies from that of Standard English, as it is generally the same format as regular statements. Questions seeking yes or no answers are usually pronounced as a statement with only a raised intonation to differentiate, usually on the last word. For example, Wunna win de cricket?  means ""Did you (pl.) win the cricket match?""; das yours? means ""Is that yours?""

On the other hand, questions asking for information, i.e. who, what, when, where, why or how, usually begin with a 'question word/phrase', saying what is being asked for, followed by a partial, or incomplete statement. For example, ""Wha he wan?"" means ""What does he want?"" or ""He wants what?"" Some question words, however, do not exist, or are seldom used in Bajan dialect, including when, where and why, and are achieved by making questions beginning with ""wha"" (what). For example, ""Wha time you see he?"" means ""When did you see him?"", and ""Wha part de Chefette?"" means ""Where is the Chefette?"" In addition, ""why"" questions can be achieved by asking ""how come"". For example, ""How come you get hay so late?”

Tenses
The tense/aspect system of Bajan is fundamentally unlike that of English. In Bajan, verbs are seldom conjugated, and only have a few forms, lacking forms to express tense or distinguish between singular and plural. In particular, there are no morphological marked past tense forms corresponding to English ""-ed"", ""-t"" or other past tense forms.

Continuous Tenses
Continuity is shown in Bajan dialect in much the same way as it is in Standard English. In Bajan, the base of the verb is changed by adding ""-in"", ""ing"" or ""ine"" to the end. For many verbs, this simply results in a contracted form of the Standard English. For example, the base ""do"", from ""to do"", becomes ""doin"" in continuous tenses, which is a contracted form of the Standard English ""doing"".

Showing Tense
In Bajan dialect, the tense of a verb is expressed through 'tense indicators'. These are special verbs which are conjugated for this purpose, and generally derive from the verbs ""to be"", ""to do"" and ""to go"".

The present tense is indicated by the words is or does, with is being considered less proper. For example, 
""I does guh church pun a Sunduh/Sundy"" → ""I go to church on Sundays""
""He does eat nuff apples"" → ""He eats a lot of apples""
The phrase ""I is"" or ""I does"", is quite commonly shortened to ""Ise"". e.g. ""Ise guh church pun a Sunduh.""
The past tense unlike other tenses, is not indicated by a tense indicator, and uses only the base of the verb. For example,
""He walk town"" → ""He walked to town""
""Dem eat all de food"" → ""They ate all of the food"".
As an exception to the rules, the verb ""to go"" is conjugated to ""went"". For example,
""I went to church Sunduh"" → ""I went to church on Sunday""

In Bajan dialect, when the past tense structure is made continuous, it instead becomes the present continuous, for example ""He watchin de show"" means ""He is watching the show"", and ""She gine eat"" means ""She is going to eat"". The present and past perfect continuous tenses replaces the past continuous.
The present perfect tense uses the indicator ""duh"". For example,
""He duh dun get hey"" → ""He has already arrived""
""Wunna dun guh school"" → ""You all have gone to school.
The past perfect or pluperfect tense is indicated by the word ""did"" or ""dih"". For example,
""He did wan guh tuh de confrunce"" → ""He had wanted to go to the conference"".
The future tense is indicated by the word ""gun"" or ""gon"". For example,
""She gine bring wunna de receipt"" → ""She will bring you all the receipt""

There are many more nuances to Bajan verbs and tenses in addition. One such nuance is that unlike Standard English, Bajan also tends towards using a zero copula. E.g. ""We in de garage"" means ""We are in the garage"". Moreover, the indicators are also used copulas, much like ""to be"" in Standard English. E.g. ""She duh in de house"" means ""She was in the house"".

Negative
Negatives are achieved by modifying the tense indicator of the sentence to end in n, or by adding ain before the verb in the past tense, present continuous or in place of the copula, or in front of the indicator in the present perfect tense. Here is a list of indicators and their negative form.

9829,"['hell the what , decided and – manner adult , responsible a in lives their approach n’t do who goofballs impulsive two – were they who about thought just We "" : said Schur ?', 'woods the in up grow you Did "" her asks Donna , awkwardly flirt Ann seeing After ?', 'Nell you Are ?']","""Andy and April's Fancy Party"" (sometimes referred to as ""Fancy Party"") is the ninth episode of the third season of the American comedy television series Parks and Recreation, and the 39th overall episode of the series. It originally aired on NBC in the United States on April 14, 2011. In the episode, Andy and April hold a dinner party, which turns out to be a surprise wedding, much to Leslie's concern. Meanwhile, Ben mulls whether to remain in Pawnee or return to his old job in Indianapolis, and Ann feels extremely uncomfortable while attending a singles mixer.

The episode was written by Katie Dippold and directed by Michael Trim. The wedding between Andy and April was a culmination of a romantic subplot between the two characters that began in the second season episode ""Hunting Trip"". The Parks and Recreation staff tried to keep the wedding secret to surprise viewers, but NBC accidentally ran a commercial advertising the wedding two months earlier, after the episode ""Ron & Tammy: Part Two."" Series co-creator Michael Schur initially said the promo was meant to refer to Ron and his ex-wife Tammy, but later admitted it was an error.

""April and Andy's Fancy Party"" featured several guest performances by actors who appeared in previous episodes, including Ben Schwartz as Jean-Ralphio Saperstein, Josh Duvendeck and Blake Lee as Derek and Ben, Minni Jo Mazzola as Natalie Ludgate, and Mark Rivers, Andrew Burlinson and Alan Yang as Andy's bandmates. According to Nielsen Media Research, the episode was seen by 5.16 million household viewers, a slight increase over the previous original episode, ""Camping"". It received generally positive reviews.

Plot
During a cold open scene, Ron (Nick Offerman) horrifies the entire parks department by apparently pulling an aching tooth out of his own mouth with a pair of pliers. He later admits it was a prank, as a dentist had removed the tooth the previous day. Later, Andy (Chris Pratt) and April (Aubrey Plaza) invite everyone to a dinner party at the home of Andy's bandmate Burly (Andrew Burlinson), where Andy is living. Ben (Adam Scott) tells Leslie (Amy Poehler) that his boss in Indianapolis wants him back on the road, but he has also been offered a job to work under Chris (Rob Lowe) in Pawnee. Although Leslie wants Ben to stay, she is hesitant to say so outright, disappointing him and leaving him conflicted over which job to take.

At the party, Leslie discovers Andy and April plan to surprise everyone by getting married that night. Leslie spends most of the party trying to dissuade them, since they have been dating less than a month and have no place to live. However, Ron believes it is not Leslie's place to interfere with their decision. Tom (Aziz Ansari) is thrilled when Andy makes him his best man, but his excitement lessens when Andy also asks Ron, Chris, and several others to be his ""best men"". Tom tries to throw an impromptu bachelor party and give a speech to make himself the ""best"" best man, but fails each time.

Although Leslie plans to object during the ceremony, she cannot bring herself to do it and comes to accept the marriage. Andy and April officially become husband and wife. Afterward, Ron explains to Leslie that she did not object because deep down she knew that Andy and April would get married no matter what, and that there is no correct way to do things when it comes to matters of the heart, using his own two former marriages as an example. During the reception, April privately tells Leslie how much she appreciates her, flattering Leslie. Andy makes a speech to the guests, where he calls Tom his ""best"" best man, much to Tom's delight. He tells the crowd that life is short and he and April simply did what made them happy. Taking Andy's advice, Leslie asks Ben to stay in Pawnee, and he surprises her by revealing that he has already accepted Chris' job offer.

In a subplot, Ann (Rashida Jones) goes to a singles mixer where she is extremely uncomfortable. She runs into Donna (Retta), who at first views Ann as competition, but then offers her advice after witnessing Ann's awkward flirting. When Ann hears about Andy getting married from Leslie, she considers going home, as she and Andy dated for several years. Donna tells Ann to forget her past and enjoy herself in the present. Ann ends up having a good time at the mixer and gets several phone numbers.

Production
""Andy and April's Fancy Party"" was written by Katie Dippold and directed by Michael Trim. It is referred to simply as ""Fancy Party"" in some publications. During a break between the development of the first six episodes of the season and the remaining episodes, the writing staff was contemplating what direction they should take with the romantic relationship between Andy and April. Parks co-creator Michael Schur said they wanted to avoid the ""standard-issue TV romance plots: fights, other men/women driving them apart, and so on"". They decided the two should get married after dating for only a short time because it was funny, it made sense with the characters' personalities, and it raised the stakes for future stories involving the two. Schur said: ""We just thought about who they were – two impulsive goofballs who don’t approach their lives in a responsible, adult manner – and decided, what the hell? What if they just make a rash decision and get hitched?""

The cast and crew of Parks and Recreation made a conscious effort not to discuss the Andy and April wedding during media interviews with the hopes of keeping it a surprise. However, after the original broadcast of the third season episode ""Ron & Tammy: Part Two"", NBC ran a commercial advertising ""April and Andy's wedding registry"" on the official Parks and Recreation website. At this point in the series, April and Andy were separated and had not yet reconciled. Shortly after the episode aired, HitFix television reviewer Alan Sepinwall wrote that the commercial mistakenly used the wrong names and was actually referring to Ron and Tammy's wedding registry. However, after ""Andy and April's Fancy Party"" aired, Schur admitted the commercial was intended to run with that episode, but ran with ""Ron & Tammy: Part Two"" due to an error by NBC employees:

""In an effort to undo the spoiler, we publicly stated, in a number of interviews, that NBC had just accidentally gotten the character names wrong, and that there was no upcoming Andy-April wedding.  We sincerely hope that fans of the show are cool with us gently lying to them, in an effort to maintain the surprise nuptials as much as we could.  Now if you'll excuse us, we have to go shoot the season finale surprise Jerry-Donna wedding scene.""

""Andy and April's Fancy Party"" featured several guest performances by actors who had appeared in previous Parks and Recreation episodes. Ben Schwartz reprised his role as Tom's playboy-like friend Jean-Ralphio Saperstein. April's flower men were Ben and Derek, played by Josh Duvendeck and Blake Lee. Derek is April's bisexual ex-boyfriend and Ben was the boy he dated while simultaneously dating April; the two had appeared in several second season episodes. Minni Jo Mazzola reprised her recurring role as April's sister Natalie Ludgate. Andy's band Mouse Rat, which has appeared in previous episodes starting with the first season finale ""Rock Show"", also appeared in ""Andy and April's Fancy Party"". Mark Rivers played the drums, Andrew Burlinson played guitar and Parks and Recreation screenwriter Alan Yang played bass guitar. Eric Isenhower made his first appearance on the show as Orin, a creepy Goth friend of April. The character was mentioned offhandedly in the episode ""Time Capsule"" and Dippold loved the idea of him, so she worked Orin into the script.

The day the episode first aired, the term ""Ron Swanson"", and the misspelled ""Rob Swanson"", were so commonly discussed on the social-networking website Twitter that they were listed among the site's trending topics, which are indicative of being the most popular topics being discussed on Twitter at a given moment. Shortly after the episode's original broadcast, NBC started a fake wedding website about the wedding called ""Andy and April's Awesome Sauce Wedding"", which included photos and a guestbook website visitors can sign.

Cultural references
Andy gets married wearing the jersey of Reggie Wayne, wide receiver for the Indianapolis Colts. April had previously given him the jersey as a gift in the second-season episode ""Christmas Scandal"". The Simon and Garfunkel song ""April Come She Will"" plays while April walks down the aisle. Chris performs a break dance to the House of Pain hip hop song ""Jump Around"". While trying to understand why the wedding is happening so quickly, Leslie asks whether April is dying, like the lead character from the 2002 romance film A Walk to Remember. While trying to decide on a joke for his best man speech, Tom asks Jean-Ralphio which Vince Vaughn movie he should choose; Jean-Ralphio confidently answers Fred Claus, a 2007 Christmas comedy film.

Ben was asked to bring the 2009 science fiction film Avatar to the wedding, along with 50 pairs of 3-D glasses and a 3-D-capable television. At one point, Tom makes fun of Ben's nerdiness by making a reference to The Lord of the Rings film trilogy, but Ben explains he did not enjoy the film adaptation by director Peter Jackson. When someone refers to actress Julia Roberts, Ron only recognizes her as ""that toothy girl from Mystic Pizza"". After seeing Ann flirt awkwardly, Donna asks her ""Did you grow up in the woods?  Are you Nell?"", referring to Jodie Foster's character from the film Nell. In one scene, Andy used the phrase ""Xbox pancake"", a reference to a video game console, while describing the idea of combining two great things.

Reception

Ratings
In its original American broadcast, ""Andy and April's Fancy Party"" was seen by an estimated 5.16 million household viewers, according to Nielsen Media Research, with a 3.1 rating/5 share among all viewers and a 2.5 rating/7 share among viewers between ages 18 and 49. It constituted a slight ratings increase over the previous original episode ""Camping"". Parks and Recreation was defeated in its 9:30 p.m. timeslot by the Fox crime drama Bones, which was seen by an average of 11.1 million households. However, Parks defeated repeats of the ABC medical drama Grey's Anatomy, which drew 4.18 million household viewers, and the CBS crime drama CSI: Crime Scene Investigation which, although it had more viewers at 8.23 million households, had a lower rating than Parks, drawing 1.5 rating/4 share among viewers between ages 18 and 49. ""Andy and April's Fancy Party"" also outperformed an original episode of the CW Network drama Nikita, which drew 2.14 million households.

Reviews

""Andy and April's Fancy Party"" received generally positive reviews. Alan Sepinwall of HitFix called it ""one of the funniest, sweetest, just plain best episodes of this season of this great comedy"", and that it embodied ""intoxicating mix of laughs and sweetness that ""Parks and Rec"" consistently nails"". Sepinwall particularly praised the scene when April declared her love for Leslie, and enjoyed the comedic pairing of Ann and Donna. Time magazine writer James Poniewozik said the episode showed Parks and Recreation in ""top form"", and he praised the episode for avoiding television cliches about weddings. In most shows, he wrote, April and Andy would have been persuaded to stop the wedding at the last moment, or Andy would have panicked after realizing the enormity of what he had done. Matt Fowler of IGN called the episode ""charming, effortless, and hilarious"" and wrote ""the strength of this episode was that it actually convinced us all that April and Andy getting married, after just a month of dating, was a great idea"". TV Guide writer Matt Roush called ""Andy and April's Fancy Wedding"" the highlight of the night among NBC's Thursday comedy shows, and said he particularly loved the scene with Ron Swanson pulling out his tooth, and another later scene where Ron criticized Chris for bringing a vegetarian loaf to the party instead of cake.

ChicagoNow writer Andy Daglas said the fact that Andy and April's wedding was subdued, not overhyped in commercials to attract ratings, shows how much the writers understand and respect their characters. He also praised the episode's blend of ""humor and heart"", of which he said: ""No show on the air, and few shows I can think of ever, does it better."" Zap2it writer Rick Porter said he was surprised by the wedding twist, particularly by the fact that the wedding was not stopped at the last moment by a ""TV-style complication"". He also praised the subplot with Ann and Donna, and said he hoped the two characters would continue to interact with each other throughout the season. The Atlantic writer Scott Meslow said ""Andy and April's Fancy Party"" showed how well the April and Andy characters have developed since their romantic story arc began in the second-season episode ""Hunting Trip"". Meslow said the episode ""couldn't have been better"" and was even effective during unabashed sentimental scenes, like the wedding itself and April voicing her appreciation for Leslie. Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club said the wedding felt appropriate for the two characters, and he enjoyed the progression of Leslie going from dreading the wedding to accepting it. Heisler wrote, ""Truly, I don't think I've ever watched an episode of Parks & Rec without feeling great at the end.""

Eric Sundermann of Hollywood.com said the fact that the wedding scene works shows how genuine the characters are and how well they are presented by the writers. Sundermann also praised the cold open with Ron ripping his tooth out, and said he enjoyed the way Ann Perkins' character has continued to develop through the season. Steve Kandell of New York magazine called April and Andy perhaps the ""most convincingly matched and resoundingly sympathetic couple in sitcom history"", and said their storylines have been handled much more effectively than those of Jim Halpert and Pam Beesly in the NBC comedy The Office. Kandell was more critical of the Ann character, and said she did not seem to fit as a part of the show anymore. Some reviews were less positive. Entertainment Weekly writer Hillary Busis said there were individual elements of the episode she enjoyed, but felt the wedding happened too quickly and the lack of buildup reduced the tension leading up to the event. Joel Keller of TV Squad said, ""In a mostly stellar season, this one sits near the bottom of the list."" Keller said the wedding ruined an otherwise funny episode, and that it felt ineffective and rushed because April and Andy were fighting with each other only four episodes earlier. He also criticized the Ann Perkins character: ""I've never seen Rashida Jones play a character this wishy-washy before, and it's not pleasant to watch.""

9866,"[""In 's What , Listenjapan , Music MSN as such websites on features special having as well as , release the promote to Magazine GyaO and ?"", ""In 's What ?"", ""In 's What ?""]","""OSCA"" is a song by Japanese rock band Tokyo Jihen, led by musician Ringo Sheena. It was released as the band's fourth single on July 11, 2007, as one of the two singles before the band's third album Variety (2007). It was the first and only single released by the band that did not feature writing by vocalist Sheena, instead created by the band's second guitarist, Ukigumo.

Background and development 

Vocalist Ringo Sheena originally debuted as a solo musician in 1998, however decided to become a member of a band instead for her main musical activities, and debuted Tokyo Jihen in 2004. After their debut album Kyōiku, two of the original members of the band made decisions to leave, and were replaced by pianist Ichiyo Izawa and guitarist Ukigumo. The new line-up released the single ""Shuraba"", a song used as the theme song for the drama Ōoku: Hana no Ran., and the band's second album, Adult (2006). Adult, while featuring lyrics entirely written by Sheena and the band collaborating to arrange the songs, also featured ""Himitsu"", which was arranged solely by Izawa, and ""Tegami"", which was composed by Izawa and arranged by Sheena.

In late 2006 and 2007, Sheena briefly resumed solo activities in collaboration with Neko Saito, on Heisei Fūzoku (2007), a soundtrack album for the Mika Ninagawa film Sakuran. The ""OSCA"" single was first announced on May 17, 2007.

The Variety project for the band involved the band members other than Sheena amassing demo tapes, and the band making careful selections. For the project, Sheena worked as a vocalist and a lyricist. After the band's tour for Adult, Domestic! Just Can't Help It, finished on May 30, 2006, Sheena requested band members Ukigumo and Ichiyo Izawa write songs for the band's next studio album. While Sheena is the primary songwriter for her solo career and for Tokyo Jihen's first two albums, she occasionally goes through periods of not being able to write music.

During the single's release schedule, the Toshiba stake of Tokyo Jihen's label Toshiba EMI was bought out by the EMI group. The label was renamed EMI Music Japan on June 30, 2007.

Writing and production 

""OSCA"" was written in spring/autumn 2006, by band guitarist Ukigumo. Unlike previous songs written by band members such as ""Gunjō Biyori"" or ""Tōmei Ningen"", the song did not have lyrical input by Sheena. Ukigumo wanted to pull out new sides of Sheena not seen before in her musical releases. The title stems from the Italian O.S.C.A. brand of sports cars, as Ukigumo, a big fan of cars, wanted a song titled after one. He was further inspired by the character Oscar François de Jarjayes from the 1970s manga Rose of Versailles, liking the dramatic image linked to the name Oscar. Ukigumo wrote the lyrics about a womanizer. Unlike ""Oiran"" from Sheena's Heisei Fūzoku or ""Mirror-ball"" from Variety, ""OSCA"" did not change much conceptually since Ukigumo wrote the song. Ukigumo also did not think that the sound would become a single, however it was popular with the other band members, who voted on which of the Variety songs would become singles.

While written for Tokyo Jihen, the song was originally performed by Ukigumo as a member of his band Petrolz. It appears on Petrolz' extended play Karimen, released in April 2007 at live events.
 The band continued to perform ""OSCA"", as well as ""Mirror-ball"", at live events even after Tokyo Jihen's disbandment in 2012.

The Variety sessions was in pre-production while Sheena was promoting Heisei Fūzoku in February 2007. She felt that the recording session reminded her of recording her debut album Muzai Moratorium (1998), in that she was free from considering the commercial music market when producing the songs.

The two B-sides are both Izawa compositions, chosen from a collection of his demos. ""Kaban no Nakami"" was written after the band finished their Domestic! Just Can't Help It. tour in mid 2006, while ""Pinocchio"" was recorded in the last half of that year. ""Pinocchio"" was written and composed entirely by Izawa, while ""Kaban no Nakami"" featured lyrics written by Sheena, translated into English by Robbie Clark.

The single is stylistically similar to their next single ""Killer-tune"", released a month later. ""OSCA"" features an A-side written by Ukigumo and two Izawa compositions, while ""Killer-tune"" was written by Izawa and featured two Ukigumo compisitons as B-sides. In both cases, the final track is a song where Sheena collaborated with Robbie Clark to create a song with English lyrics. Neither release featured a cover song, unlike Tokyo Jihen's first three singles. The official English title for the song was stylised differently as ""O.S.C.A."", a style also found on the Petrolz extended play Karimen. The B-side ""Kaban no Nakami"" was given an entirely new title unrelated to the original title, ""Crosswalk"".

According to the musical score of ""OSCA"", it is written in the key of E major in common time with a tempo of 130 beats per minute. The track follows the chord progression of E7–A7 in the introduction, which changes to A7–C7–D7–C7–F7 at the end of the second verse.

Promotion and release 

The band appeared in magazines Musica, Rockin' On Japan, Oricon Style, Barfout! and GyaO Magazine to promote the release, as well as having special features on websites such as MSN Music, Listenjapan, What's In? Web, Excite, Yahoo! and Amazon.co.jp. The song was performed during the band's Spa & Treatment (2007), Ultra C (2010), Discovery (2011) and Bon Voyage (2012) tours, with the band also performing the song during their festival/event performances at the Rising Sun Rock Festival (2008), Society of the Citizens Vol. 2 (2008), Countdown Japan (2009), EMI Rocks (2010) and the Terebi Asahi Dream Music Festival (2011). Additionally, the two B-sides ""Pinnochio"" and ""Kaban no Nakami"" were performed during the Spa & Treatment tour, with ""Pinocchio"" also making the set-list for the band's Rising Sun Rock Festival performance.

Soon after the release of the single, the band began promotions for ""Killer-tune"", which was released as a single a month after, and the Variety album, which was released on September 26, 2007.

Music video 

A music video was first unveiled on June 18, 2007. It was directed by Yuichi Kodama, the first time Sheena or the band has worked with him, and also featured a collaboration with dance troupe Idevian Crew. The video focuses on four female dancers, as well as the members of Tokyo Jihen in police uniforms. Sheena sings the song into a megaphone, while wearing a white dress and occasionally a police-style peaked cap. The video was nominated for the Best Video of the Year award at the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards Japan, however lost to Exile's ""I Believe"".

Three edits of the video exist. In addition to the original version, a version centring on the band, as well as a version centred on Idevian Crew dancers exist. These three versions were compiled on the Senkō Shōjo music video DVD, released on November 21, 2007.

Critical reception 

Kiyohiko Koike for Listenmusic felt the song was an ""aggressive number erupting all the band member's fervour"" created by aspects such as the ""quick beat, growling bass line and Ringo's freaky passionate voice"". He felt the song was not a song you could call a single feeling it had an ""eccentric spirit of adventure"", but praised Sheena being used as a resource by her bandmates in the production of a song, and felt that the ""mental aspects"" of the band had evolved. Hot Express reviewer Tetsuo Hiraga praised Sheena's ""charming"" vocals in the song, and felt as if the song were exploding from every direction. He believed that this ""broken"" Sheena had not been seen in her previous works before. CDJournal reviewers noted the song's structure, describing it as ""developing into a constantly changing song, as if many songs were in a single song."" Reviewer Naoko Saito was very positive on the song, praising the ""exploding tricky band sound"", calling the song ""full of thrills and excitement, like looking at something you shouldn't be"". What's In? reviewers called the song a ""wild rock tune"", noting its ""bewildering structure"".

What's In? reviewers noted how varied the musical styles of the three songs on the single were. Of the B-sides, reviewers praised the sentimentality in ""Pinocchio"", with Hiraga likening it to ""Gamble"" from Sheena's soundtrack album Heisei Fūzoku (2007). CDJournal reviewers praised the mix of ""a self-backed piano style with a country taste"" in the song. Saito felt that ""Kaban no Nakami"" had a ""slightly '60s taste"", while CDJournal called ""Kaban no Nakami"" an ""old taste pop tune,"" and a honky-tonk piano and guitar song ""as if [Sheena] were performing it in the corner of a southern US bar"", and praised Sheena's lyrics as ""cute"".
